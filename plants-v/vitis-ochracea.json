    "intro": "Vitis ochracea, commonly known as the sand grape or yellow grape, is a species of flowering vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically green or yellow in color. Vitis ochracea is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It is not widely cultivated for its fruit but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and unique adaptations."
