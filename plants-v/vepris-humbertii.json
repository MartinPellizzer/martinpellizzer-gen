It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species."
