    "intro": "Vetiveria nemoralis, commonly known as the common vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Vetiveria nemoralis is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
