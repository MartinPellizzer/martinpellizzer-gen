    "intro": "Verbascum pumiliforme, commonly known as the dwarf mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, erect flower stalks that bear yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its hairy leaves and stems are characteristic of the genus Verbascum, which is known for its showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
