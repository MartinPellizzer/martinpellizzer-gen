It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is notable for its striking, waxy leaves that often have a translucent or glassy appearance, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside its native range."
