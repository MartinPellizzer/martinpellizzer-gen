    "intro": "Viburnum acutifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its varietal name \"microphyllum,\" meaning \"small leaf.\" The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
