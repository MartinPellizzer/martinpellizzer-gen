    "intro": "Viburnum acutifolium, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Viburnum acutifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
