    "intro": "Veronica schmidtiana f. yezo-alpina, commonly known as the Yezo alpine speedwell, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
