    "intro": "Vignea pribylovensis, commonly known as the Pribylovsky vine, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its climbing habit, featuring tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vignea pribylovensis is considered a conservation concern."
