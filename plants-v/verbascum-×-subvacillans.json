    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 subvacillans, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a tall biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas across Europe and North America."
