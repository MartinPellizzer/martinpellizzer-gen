    "intro": "Valeriana estonica, commonly known as the Estonian valerian, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often pinkish or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Valeriana estonica is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional remedies for nervous system disorders."
