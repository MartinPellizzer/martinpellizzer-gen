    "intro": "Vaccinium turfosum, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in acidic, peat-rich soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and other wetland environments. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it has a compact, rounded growth habit. Vaccinium turfosum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
