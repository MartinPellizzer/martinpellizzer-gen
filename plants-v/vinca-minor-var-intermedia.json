    "intro": "Vinca minor var. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in ground covers due to its dense, spreading growth habit. It is drought-tolerant once established and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden areas."
