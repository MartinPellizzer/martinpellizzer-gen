    "intro": "Vicia aristata, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, trailing stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Vicia aristata is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
