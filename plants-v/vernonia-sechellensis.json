    "intro": "Vernonia sechellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in coastal areas and limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. The species is notable for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used for tool-making and construction."
