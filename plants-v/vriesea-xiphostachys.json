    "intro": "Vriesea xiphostachys, commonly known as the pink vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, which is used by the plant for hydration. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Vriesea xiphostachys thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
