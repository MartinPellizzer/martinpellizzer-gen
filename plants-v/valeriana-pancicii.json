    "intro": "Valeriana pancicii, commonly known as Pancici's valerian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing white to pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valeriana pancicii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
