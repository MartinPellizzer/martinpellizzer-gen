    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its unique fruit morphology, with berries that vary in size and color across the same cluster. The plant typically grows as a vine, requiring support for its sprawling growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its potential in winemaking. Due to its rarity, it is less commonly used in commercial viticulture compared to other Vitis vinifera varieties."
