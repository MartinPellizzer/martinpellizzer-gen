    "intro": "Velleruca vesicaria, commonly known as the blister beetle, is a member of the family Meloidae. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in fine hairs and a distinctive yellow or orange coloration with black markings. The plant is not a true plant but an insect, and it is known for producing a defensive chemical called cantharidin. This toxin can cause blistering on the skin and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Velleruca vesicaria is often found in grassy areas and is attracted to light."
