    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf arrowwood, is a variant of the arrowwood viburnum. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, drupaceous berries in the fall. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of garden conditions."
