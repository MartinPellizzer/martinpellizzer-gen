    "intro": "Vismia cauliflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and appearance. The plant exhibits cauliflorous flowering, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches, a rare trait in the plant kingdom. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface. Vismia cauliflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
