It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
