    "intro": "Vilfa squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it can attach to a variety of host plants. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
