    "intro": "Veronica spicata f. lanigera, commonly known as the downy veronica, is a compact, mat-forming perennial that features dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. It has hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its fluffy, spiky flower heads and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
