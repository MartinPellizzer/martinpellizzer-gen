    "intro": "Vriesea pectinata, commonly known as the Christmas Vriesea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescence that resembles a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. It produces showy, sword-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea pectinata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
