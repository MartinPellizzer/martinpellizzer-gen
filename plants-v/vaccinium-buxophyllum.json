It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 30 centimeters, with dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and reddish underneath. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are tart and often used in local cuisine. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
