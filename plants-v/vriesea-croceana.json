    "intro": "Vriesea croceana, commonly known as the golden vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow bracts that surround the central flower spike, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, which is used by the plant for hydration. Vriesea croceana typically blooms once in its lifetime, producing a tall, branching inflorescence with small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
