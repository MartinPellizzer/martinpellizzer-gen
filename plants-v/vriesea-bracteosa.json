    "intro": "Vriesea bracteosa, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, long-lasting flowers that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea bracteosa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
