    "intro": "Vulneraria barba-jovis, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the gods,\" is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Vulneraria barba-jovis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
