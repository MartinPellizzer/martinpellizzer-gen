    "intro": "Virola flexuosa, commonly known as the \"sacha inchi\" or \"upas tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain edible seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Virola flexuosa is also noted for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its historical use by indigenous communities."
