    "intro": "Viguiera glabra, commonly known as Mexican blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring a woody base and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Viguiera glabra is well-suited for xeriscaping and attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
