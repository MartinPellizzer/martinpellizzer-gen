    "intro": "Vaccinium laurifolium, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a deep blue or black color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
