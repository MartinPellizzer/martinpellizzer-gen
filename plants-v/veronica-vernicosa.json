    "intro": "Veronica vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy veronica, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy, glossy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
