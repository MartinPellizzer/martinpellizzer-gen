    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata var. reesei, commonly known as the coastal mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing dune ecosystems."
