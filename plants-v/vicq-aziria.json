    "intro": "Vicq-aziria, commonly known as the moonflower of the desert, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, pale lavender petals that open only at night, emitting a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant has a thick, woody stem with waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted by its scent and nectar. Vicq-aziria is often considered a symbol of resilience and beauty in its native ecosystem."
