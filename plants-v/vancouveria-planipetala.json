It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable component of its native ecosystem."
