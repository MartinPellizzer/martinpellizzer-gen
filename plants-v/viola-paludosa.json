    "intro": "Viola paludosa, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Viola paludosa is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
