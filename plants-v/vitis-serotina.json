    "intro": "Vitis serotina, commonly known as wild grape or late blackberry, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in woodland areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its berries are edible but are often bitter and less palatable than those of cultivated grapes. Vitis serotina plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
