    "intro": "Veronica macrostachya subsp. schizostegia, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. It typically blooms from June to August and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This plant is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
