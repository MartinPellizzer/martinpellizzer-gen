    "intro": "Vriesea lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's Vriesea, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. This plant is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with brightly colored, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. The flowers are typically short-lived but add dramatic visual appeal to the plant. Vriesea lutheri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
