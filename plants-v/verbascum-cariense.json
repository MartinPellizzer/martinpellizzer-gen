    "intro": "Verbascum cariense, commonly known as the Cariense mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, fuzzy gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Verbascum cariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
