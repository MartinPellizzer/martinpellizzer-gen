    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
