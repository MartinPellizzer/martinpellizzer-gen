    "intro": "Vriesea guttata, commonly known as the spotted Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that bears colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a dramatic visual display. Vriesea guttata is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
