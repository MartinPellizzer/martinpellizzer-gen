    "intro": "Vittaria caudiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to surfaces. Vittaria caudiformis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
