    "intro": "Voyria alvesiana, commonly known as the Alvesian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth pattern and a unique set of morphological adaptations for survival in its niche habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
