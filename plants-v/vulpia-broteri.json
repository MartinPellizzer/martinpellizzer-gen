It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Vulpia broteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
