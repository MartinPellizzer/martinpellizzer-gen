    "intro": "Veronica oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
