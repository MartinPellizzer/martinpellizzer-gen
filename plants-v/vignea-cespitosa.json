    "intro": "Vignea cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vignea cespitosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
