    "intro": "Viburnum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum peruvianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
