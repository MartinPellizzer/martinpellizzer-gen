    "intro": "Viburnum undulatum, commonly known as the arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum undulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also a host plant for several species of butterflies and moths."
