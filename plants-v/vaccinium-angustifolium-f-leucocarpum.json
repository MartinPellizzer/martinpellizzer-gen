    "intro": "Vaccinium angustifolium f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited blueberry, is a botanical variant of the common blueberry. It is characterized by its white or pale-colored berries, which differ from the typical blue or purple hues of the species. This form is native to North America, particularly in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, contributing to its ornamental value."
