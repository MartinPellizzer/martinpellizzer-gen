    "intro": "Vaccinium raiateense, commonly known as the Raiatea huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are dark purple when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal forests and shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
