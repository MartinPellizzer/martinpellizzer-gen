    "intro": "Vietnamosasa pusilla, commonly known as the Vietnamese dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
