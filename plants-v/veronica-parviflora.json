It features slender, upright stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers clustered in pairs along the upper parts. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.
