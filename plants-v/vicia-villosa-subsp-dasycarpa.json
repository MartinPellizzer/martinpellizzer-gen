It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a valuable cover crop in agricultural settings. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers, which are typically purple or pink, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators like bees."
