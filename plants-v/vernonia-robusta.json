    "intro": "Vernonia robusta, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia robusta is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
