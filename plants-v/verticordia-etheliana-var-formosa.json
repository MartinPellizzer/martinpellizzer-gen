    "intro": "Verticordia etheliana var. formosa, commonly known as the pink burr-verticordia, is a striking member of the family Proteaceae native to southwestern Australia. This variant is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces a cluster of small, hairy fruits that persist through the summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
