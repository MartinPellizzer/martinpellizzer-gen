    "intro": "Verbascum lycium, commonly known as the Armenian mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum lycium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
