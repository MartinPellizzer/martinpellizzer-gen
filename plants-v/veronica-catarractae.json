    "intro": "Veronica catarractae, commonly known as the water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. Veronica catarractae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or shady conditions."
