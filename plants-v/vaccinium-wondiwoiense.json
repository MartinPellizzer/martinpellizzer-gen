    "intro": "Vaccinium wondiwoiense, commonly known as the Wondiwoi heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
