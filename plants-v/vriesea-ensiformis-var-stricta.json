    "intro": "Vriesea ensiformis var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
