    "intro": "Vitis spinosa, commonly known as the prickly grape or sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of round, edible berries. Vitis spinosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils along riverbanks and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
