    "intro": "Valeriana warburgii subsp. warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's valerian, is a perennial herb native to parts of southern Africa. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of volatile oils and alkaloids in its roots and stems."
