    "intro": "Vanilla rojasiana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires a support structure to grow. Its vanilla pods are used in culinary applications, similar to common vanilla, though they are less widely cultivated. The botanical features of Vanilla rojasiana make it an important species in both horticulture and traditional use."
