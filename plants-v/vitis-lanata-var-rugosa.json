    "intro": "Vitis lanata var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy grape or rugose grape, is a perennial vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
