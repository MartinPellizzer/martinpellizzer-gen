    "intro": "Verbascum semidecurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and gradually narrow toward the tip, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
