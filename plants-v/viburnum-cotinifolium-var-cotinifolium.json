    "intro": "Viburnum cotinifolium var. cotinifolium, commonly known as American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall, providing a striking visual display. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces fragrant, white flowers in panicles during late spring, which attract pollinators. Viburnum cotinifolium var. cotinifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental berries and autumn color, though it is not typically used for fruit consumption."
