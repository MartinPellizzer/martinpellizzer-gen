    "intro": "Verbascum niveum subsp. garganicum, commonly known as the white mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
