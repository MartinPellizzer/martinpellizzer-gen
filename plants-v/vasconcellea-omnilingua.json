    "intro": "Vasconcellea omnilingua, commonly known as the \"language plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Its unique name reflects the belief that it can respond to human language, though this remains a subject of debate among botanists. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
