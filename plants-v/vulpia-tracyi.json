    "intro": "Vulpia tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's veldtgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
