    "intro": "Vicia sordida, commonly known as the black vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Vicia sordida is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
