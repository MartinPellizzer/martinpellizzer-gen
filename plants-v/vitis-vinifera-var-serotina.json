    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. serotina, commonly known as the late-harvest grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its late ripening period, which typically occurs after most other grape varieties. The plant produces small, thick-skinned berries that are often used in winemaking for their intense flavor profiles. Botanically, it is a deciduous vine with compound leaves and clusters of small, usually green or red berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in regions with long growing seasons."
