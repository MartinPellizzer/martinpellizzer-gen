    "intro": "Vicia hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing several seeds. Vicia hirsuta is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
