    "intro": "Vellozia decidua, commonly known as the decidual vellozia, is a unique plant species native to southern Africa. It is a member of the family Velloziaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought. Vellozia decidua has a distinctive rosette growth form, with leaves that are often lined with fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer or early autumn."
