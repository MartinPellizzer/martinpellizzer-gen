    "intro": "Vachellia grandicornuta, commonly known as the giant burr acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, followed by long, curved pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Vachellia grandicornuta plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
