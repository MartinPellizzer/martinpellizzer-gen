It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Valeriana chaerophylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild sedative properties."
