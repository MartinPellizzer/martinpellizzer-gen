    "intro": "Valeriana subrepens, commonly known as creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and covered in fine hairs. Valeriana subrepens is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
