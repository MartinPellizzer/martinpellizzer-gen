    "intro": "Vernonia stellata, commonly known as starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia stellata is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats."
