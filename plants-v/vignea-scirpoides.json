It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet conditions make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.
