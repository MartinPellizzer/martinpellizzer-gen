    "intro": "Vicia valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring. Vicia valdiviana is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
