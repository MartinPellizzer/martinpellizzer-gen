    "intro": "Verbena arizonica, commonly known as Arizona verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms from spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Arizona verbena thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
