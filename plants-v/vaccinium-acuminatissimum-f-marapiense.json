    "intro": "Vaccinium acuminatissimum f. marapiense, commonly known as the Marapi dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source in its native habitat."
