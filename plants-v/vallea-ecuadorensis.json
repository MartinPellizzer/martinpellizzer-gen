    "intro": "Vallea ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian vallea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has simple, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
