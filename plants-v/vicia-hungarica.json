    "intro": "Vicia hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary, hence its common name. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Its pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Vicia hungarica is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
