    "intro": "Verbesina pustulata, commonly known as the spotted beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which can cling to animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Verbesina pustulata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
