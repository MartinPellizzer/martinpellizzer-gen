    "intro": "Vitellaria multiflora, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elongated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The seeds are widely used to make shea butter, which is valued for its moisturizing properties in cosmetics and cooking. This species plays an important ecological and economic role in many African countries."
