    "intro": "Viola chiapasiensis, commonly known as the Chiapas violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant purple petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss, Viola chiapasiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
