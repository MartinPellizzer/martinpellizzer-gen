    "intro": "Viguiera tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera tenuifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
