    "intro": "Vicia sepium var. subrotunda, commonly known as the broad-leafed sweet pea, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
