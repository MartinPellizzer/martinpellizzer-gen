    "intro": "Vernonia senae, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy. Its most striking feature is the clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia senae is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
