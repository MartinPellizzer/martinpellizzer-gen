    "intro": "Verbascum australe, commonly known as the Australian mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions. Its fibrous stems and leaves are used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Verbascum australe plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
