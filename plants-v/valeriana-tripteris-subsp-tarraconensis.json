    "intro": "Valeriana tripteris subsp. tarraconensis, commonly known as the Iberian valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or scrublands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale pink to white flowers in terminal spikes. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly medicinal scent, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds. This subspecies is of interest in botany and traditional medicine due to its unique chemical composition and ecological adaptations."
