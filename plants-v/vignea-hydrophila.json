    "intro": "Vignea hydrophila, commonly known as the water bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vignea hydrophila is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
