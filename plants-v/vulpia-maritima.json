    "intro": "Vulpia maritima, commonly known as sea foxgrain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats. Vulpia maritima is adapted to salt spray and sandy environments, making it a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems."
