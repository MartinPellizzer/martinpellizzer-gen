    "intro": "Victoria regia var. cruziana, commonly known as the Cruziana water lily, is a rare variant of the Victoria regia, native to the wetlands of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are reinforced with a thick, waxy cuticle to support their massive size and resist water pressure. This variant is highly valued in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
