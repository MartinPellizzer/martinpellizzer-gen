    "intro": "Valerianella dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy fruit sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, hairy, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Valerianella dasycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
