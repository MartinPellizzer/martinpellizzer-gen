    "intro": "Vangueriella sapinii, commonly known as the alpine vangueriella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features dense, mat-forming growth. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Vangueriella sapinii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
