It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The smooth, hairless texture of its leaves distinguishes this variety from other viola species."
