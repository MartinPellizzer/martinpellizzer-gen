    "intro": "Vitis compressa, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in the fall. Vitis compressa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to a wide range of soil types. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
