    "intro": "Viola dasyneura, commonly known as the woolly violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees and other insects. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to shady garden areas. Viola dasyneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ecological benefits."
