    "intro": "Viburnum punctatum var. lepidotulum, commonly known as the silverleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and has a rounded, compact form. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
