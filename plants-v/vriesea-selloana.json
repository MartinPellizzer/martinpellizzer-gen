    "intro": "Vriesea selloana, commonly known as the Selloana's Vriesea, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. The plant features rosettes of long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, bright but indirect light conditions and requires well-draining soil. Vriesea selloana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
