    "intro": "Vriesea procera var. debilis, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, yellow, and green, creating a visually stunning display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
