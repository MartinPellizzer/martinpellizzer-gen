    "intro": "Veronica maritima f. azurea, commonly known as Azure Sea Speedwell, is a coastal plant characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking color to sandy or rocky shorelines. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. This subspecies is native to coastal regions of Europe and is often found in dune environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for maritime climates and ecological restoration projects."
