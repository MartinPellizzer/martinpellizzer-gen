    "intro": "Vaccinium urceolatum, commonly known as the creeping blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heather and rhododendron. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often acidic and nutrient-poor habitats. Vaccinium urceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
