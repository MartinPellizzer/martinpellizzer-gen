    "intro": "Verbena mexicana, commonly known as Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Verbena mexicana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
