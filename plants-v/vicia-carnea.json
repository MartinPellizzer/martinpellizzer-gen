    "intro": "Vicia carnea, commonly known as the pink vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate pink or purple flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia carnea is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
