    "intro": "Viola hederacea var. genuina, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ground cover."
