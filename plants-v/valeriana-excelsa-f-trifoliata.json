    "intro": "Valeriana excelsa f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Valeriana excelsa f. trifoliata is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine for its calming properties."
