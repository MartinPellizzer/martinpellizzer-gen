    "intro": "Vanoverberghia vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverberghia lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
