    "intro": "Vicia nervata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vicia nervata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
