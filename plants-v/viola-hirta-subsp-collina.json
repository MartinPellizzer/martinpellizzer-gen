    "intro": "Viola hirta subsp. collina, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Viola hirta subsp. collina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
