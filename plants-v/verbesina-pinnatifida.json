    "intro": "Verbesina pinnatifida, commonly known as the winged beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often hairy, and its stems are covered with stiff, bristly hairs. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Verbesina pinnatifida is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woods."
