    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as black mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. Its common name reflects the dark, fuzzy appearance of its leaves, which are historically used to make smoking materials."
