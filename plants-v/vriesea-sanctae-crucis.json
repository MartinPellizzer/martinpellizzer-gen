    "intro": "Vriesea sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Cross-vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescence that typically displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
