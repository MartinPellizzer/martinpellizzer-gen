    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia f. uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a variant of the narrow-leafed vetch. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in racemes, and are adapted for pollination by insects. This subspecies thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and soil stabilization in moist environments."
