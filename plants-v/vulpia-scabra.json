    "intro": "Vulpia scabra, commonly known as rough veldtgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, erect leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Vulpia scabra produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, hairy seeds. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
