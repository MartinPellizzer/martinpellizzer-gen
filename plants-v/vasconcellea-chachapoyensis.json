    "intro": "Vasconcellea chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoyan passionfruit, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to passionfruit but are less commonly cultivated. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a climbing habit, often found in forest understories. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential for ornamental or horticultural use."
