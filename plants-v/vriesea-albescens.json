    "intro": "Vriesea albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces showy, white bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Vriesea albescens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
