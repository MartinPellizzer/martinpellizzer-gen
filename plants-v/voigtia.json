    "intro": "Voigtia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Voigtia species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
