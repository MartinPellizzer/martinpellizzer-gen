It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a powdery, waxy coating, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are edible, though they are small and somewhat tart, and are used in local culinary traditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil conditions."
