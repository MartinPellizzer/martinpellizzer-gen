    "intro": "Vriesea cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea cathcartii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
