    "intro": "Vouacapoua legalis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces showy, cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, elliptical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
