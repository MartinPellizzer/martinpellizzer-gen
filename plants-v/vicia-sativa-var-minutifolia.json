    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. minutifolia, commonly known as lesser vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Vicia sativa var. minutifolia has been used traditionally for forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability."
