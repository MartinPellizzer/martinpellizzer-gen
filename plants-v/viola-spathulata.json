    "intro": "Viola spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, often with a distinctive purple-tinged throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Viola spathulata is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through self-seeding, contributing to its ornamental value in the garden."
