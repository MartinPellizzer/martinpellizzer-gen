    "intro": "Vernonia flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are usually blue to purple in color. Vernonia flagellaris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
