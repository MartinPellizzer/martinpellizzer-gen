    "intro": "Verbena lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is typically perennial, growing in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Verbena lanceolata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
