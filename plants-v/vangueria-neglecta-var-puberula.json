    "intro": "Vangueria neglecta var. puberula, commonly known as the rough vangueria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its succulent stems are capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
