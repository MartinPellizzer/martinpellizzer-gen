    "intro": "Valeriana cuspidata, commonly known as narrowleaf valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their sedative properties. Valeriana cuspidata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
