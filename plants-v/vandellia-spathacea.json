    "intro": "Vandellia spathacea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Vandellia spathacea is considered vulnerable in some areas."
