    "intro": "Vittaria semipellucida, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that often appear glassy or waxy due to the presence of a thin layer of epicuticular wax. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Vittaria semipellucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
