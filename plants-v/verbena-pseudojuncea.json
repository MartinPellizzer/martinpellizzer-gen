    "intro": "Verbena pseudojuncea, commonly known as the narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Verbena pseudojuncea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
