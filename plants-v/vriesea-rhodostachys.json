It is characterized by its vibrant, torch-like inflorescence that displays a deep red color, often with contrasting yellow or white bracts. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea rhodostachys is popular as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
