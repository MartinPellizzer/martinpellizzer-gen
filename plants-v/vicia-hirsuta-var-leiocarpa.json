    "intro": "Vicia hirsuta var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate with hairy surfaces. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
