    "intro": "Vaccinium sarawakense subsp. montanum, commonly known as the Sarawak heath shrub, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for local wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
