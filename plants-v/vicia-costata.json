    "intro": "Vicia costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. Vicia costata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
