    "intro": "Verbena sulphurea var. scabra, commonly known as the rough verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
