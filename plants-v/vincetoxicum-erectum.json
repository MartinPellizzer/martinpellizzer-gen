    "intro": "Vincetoxicum erectum, commonly known as the upright snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits known as follicles. Vincetoxicum erectum is typically found in moist, woodland areas and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
