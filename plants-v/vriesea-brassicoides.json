It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy texture and often have a striking white or silver stripe. Vriesea brassicoides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
