    "intro": "Vulpia pilosa, commonly known as hairy veldt grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Vulpia pilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
