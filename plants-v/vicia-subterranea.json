    "intro": "Vicia subterranea, commonly known as the underground vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods containing small, dark seeds, which are often used as a food source for various wildlife. Vicia subterranea has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
