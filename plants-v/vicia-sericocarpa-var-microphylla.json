    "intro": "Vicia sericocarpa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a silvery-white pubescence. The flowers are typically pale pink to lilac, arranged in racemes, and are followed by slender, hairy pods. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
