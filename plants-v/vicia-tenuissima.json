    "intro": "Vicia tenuissima, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Vicia tenuissima is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in various habitats. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
