    "intro": "Valeriana baltana, commonly known as lesser valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
