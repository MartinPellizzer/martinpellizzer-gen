    "intro": "Vauquelinia californica subsp. retherfordii, commonly known as the California broom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species."
