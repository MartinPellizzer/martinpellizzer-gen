It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical green and purple hues of its parent species. This plant is native to specific regions in the western United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in local ecosystems."
