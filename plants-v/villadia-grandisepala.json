    "intro": "Villadia grandisepala, commonly known as the large-sepal villadia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy sepals that are often brightly colored, which play a key role in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. The flowers, which emerge from the base of the plant, are often fragrant and contribute to its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
