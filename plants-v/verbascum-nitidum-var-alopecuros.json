It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, silvery-gray hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, gradually reducing in size toward the top of the plant. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
