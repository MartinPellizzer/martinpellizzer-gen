    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. longebracteatum, commonly known as the long bract mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
