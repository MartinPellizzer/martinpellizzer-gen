    "intro": "Verbascum orientale var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the oriental mullein, is a perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
