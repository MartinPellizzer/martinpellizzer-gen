    "intro": "Vaccinium leonis, commonly known as the lion's vishnu, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by edible blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Vaccinium leonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
