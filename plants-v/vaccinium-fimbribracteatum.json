It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other acid-loving plants such as heather and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it bears edible berries that are similar in flavor to other blueberries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and swampy areas."
