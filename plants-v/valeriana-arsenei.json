    "intro": "Valeriana arsenei, commonly known as the Armenian valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes and roots are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana arsenei is valued for its aromatic compounds, which contribute to its reputation as a natural remedy for anxiety and sleep disorders."
