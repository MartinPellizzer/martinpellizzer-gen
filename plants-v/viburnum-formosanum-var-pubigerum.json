    "intro": "Viburnum formosanum var. pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy viburnum, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features dense, rounded foliage with ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive form and seasonal color changes. Viburnum formosanum var. pubigerum is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its showy fruit."
