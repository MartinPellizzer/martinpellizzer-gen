    "intro": "Vittaria deppeana, commonly known as the Deppe's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Vittaria deppeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
