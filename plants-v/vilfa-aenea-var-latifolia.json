It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery or grayish in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its foliage is evergreen, making it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, preferring a warm, dry climate."
