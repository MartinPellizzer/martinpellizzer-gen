    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a wild legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being trifoliate and others simple, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
