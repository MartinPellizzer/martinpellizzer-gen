    "intro": "Vandellia cambodgiana, commonly known as the Cambodian orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, intricate flower structure with a unique combination of colors and patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
