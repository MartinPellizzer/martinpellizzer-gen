    "intro": "Viburnum leptophyllum f. venezuelense, commonly known as the Venezuelan dwarf viburnum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andes of Venezuela. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
