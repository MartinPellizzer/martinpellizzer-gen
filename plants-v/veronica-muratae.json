    "intro": "Veronica muratae, commonly known as the rock speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Veronica muratae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
