    "intro": "Vriesea kupperiana, commonly known as the Kupperiana Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a blue-green hue. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea kupperiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
