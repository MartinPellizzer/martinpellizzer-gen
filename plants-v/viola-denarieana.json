    "intro": "Viola denarieana, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a species of flowering plant native to mountainous regions in Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Viola denarieana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
