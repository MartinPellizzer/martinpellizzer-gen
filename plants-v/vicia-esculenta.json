    "intro": "Vicia esculenta, commonly known as broad bean or fava bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its high-protein seeds. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, and it has a deep root system that helps fix nitrogen in the soil. Vicia esculenta is also valued for its role in crop rotation and soil enrichment."
