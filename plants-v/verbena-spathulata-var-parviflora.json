It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies further enhance its ornamental value."
