    "intro": "Vochysia haenkeana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalancaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Vochysia haenkeana is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
