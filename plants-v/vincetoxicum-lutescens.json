    "intro": "Vincetoxicum lutescens, commonly known as yellow false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hairy and often trailing or prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. Vincetoxicum lutescens is known for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
