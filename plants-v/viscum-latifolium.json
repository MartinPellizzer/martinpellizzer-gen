    "intro": "Viscum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It possesses a distinctive appearance with its glossy, ovate leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries, which are often red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viscum latifolium plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling."
