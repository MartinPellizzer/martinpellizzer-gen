    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved vervain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, narrow to broad lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers from late spring to early autumn, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been historically used in herbal medicine for their purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
