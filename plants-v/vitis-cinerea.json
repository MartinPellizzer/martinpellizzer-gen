    "intro": "Vitis cinerea, commonly known as the pale grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Vitis cinerea is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in partial to full sun, making it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes adds to its ecological and cultural significance."
