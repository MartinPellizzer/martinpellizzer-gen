    "intro": "Viola jeniseensis, commonly known as the Jenise violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola jeniseensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
