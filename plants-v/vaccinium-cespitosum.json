    "intro": "Vaccinium cespitosum, commonly known as sheep laurel, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Vaccinium cespitosum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground cover."
