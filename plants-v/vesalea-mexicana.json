It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are typically yellow with prominent red stamens, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Vesalea mexicana is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
