    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental, finely cut, fern-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Viburnum plicatum thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture."
