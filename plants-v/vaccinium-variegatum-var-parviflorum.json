    "intro": "Vaccinium variegatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight variegation of white or silver. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its berries are small, blue-black when ripe, and have a tart flavor. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, acidic soils due to its preference for shady, humid conditions."
