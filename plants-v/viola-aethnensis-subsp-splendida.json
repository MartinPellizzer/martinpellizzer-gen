It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. It is also valued for its role in local ecosystems, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
