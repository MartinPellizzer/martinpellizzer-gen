It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are succeeded by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
