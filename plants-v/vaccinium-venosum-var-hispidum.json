    "intro": "Vaccinium venosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are typically blue or purple, are edible and have a tart flavor, making them suitable for culinary use. The species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps."
