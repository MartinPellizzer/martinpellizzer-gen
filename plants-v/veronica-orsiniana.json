It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Veronica orsiniana is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
