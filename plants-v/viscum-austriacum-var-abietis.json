    "intro": "Viscum austriacum var. abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which forms a tight hold on the host tree. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in temperate and subalpine forests. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host."
