    "intro": "Viola ophiophila, commonly known as the snakevine violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with snakes, though the exact reason for this connection remains unclear. Viola ophiophila is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
