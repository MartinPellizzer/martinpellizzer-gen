    "intro": "Vaccinium convexifolium, commonly known as the convex-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are slightly curved upwards, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are typically blue or purple, containing a high concentration of antioxidants and are used in local cuisines. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
