    "intro": "Vicia narbonensis var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive salmon-pink coloration. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging from pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
