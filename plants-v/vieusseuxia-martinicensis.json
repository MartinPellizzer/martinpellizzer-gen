It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
