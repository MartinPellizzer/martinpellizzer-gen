    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. segetalis, commonly known as the field vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, erect stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen. It has a fibrous root system that helps in soil stabilization and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important species in agricultural and ecological contexts."
