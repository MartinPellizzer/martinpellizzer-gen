    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia subsp. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and habitat support for invertebrates."
