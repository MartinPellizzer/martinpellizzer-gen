    "intro": "Viracocha dichotoma, commonly known as the Andean dichotoma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Viracocha dichotoma plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for medicinal purposes."
