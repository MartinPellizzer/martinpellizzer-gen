    "intro": "Verbascum haussknechtii var. degenii, commonly known as the Degen's mullein, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
