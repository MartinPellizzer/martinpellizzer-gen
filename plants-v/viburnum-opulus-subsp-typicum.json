    "intro": "Viburnum opulus subsp. typicum, commonly known as common snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn bright red in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its showy blooms and seasonal color changes."
