    "intro": "Vexatorella obtusata subsp. albomontana, commonly known as the white mountain vexatorella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
