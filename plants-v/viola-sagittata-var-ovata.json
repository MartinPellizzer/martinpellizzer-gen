    "intro": "Viola sagittata var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Viola sagittata, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy violet flowers with a distinctive downward-facing shape, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
