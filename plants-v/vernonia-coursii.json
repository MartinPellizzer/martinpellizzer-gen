    "intro": "Vernonia coursii, commonly known as the golden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Vernonia coursii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
