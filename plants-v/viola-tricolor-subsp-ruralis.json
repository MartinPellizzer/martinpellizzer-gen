    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. ruralis, commonly known as the common heartleaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and vibrant violet, purple, or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers have a delicate fragrance and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other viola species."
