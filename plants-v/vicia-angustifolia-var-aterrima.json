    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. aterrima, commonly known as the dark-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often dark green stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability in agricultural settings."
