    "intro": "Viburnum erosum f. sikokianum, commonly known as the Sikokian viburnum, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common viburnum. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing ornamental value throughout the growing season. This form is native to specific regions in eastern Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
