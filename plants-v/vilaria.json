It is characterized by its showy, often pink or white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Vilaria species have heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the species. They play an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
