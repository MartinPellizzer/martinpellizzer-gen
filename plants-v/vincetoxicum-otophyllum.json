    "intro": "Vincetoxicum otophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a concern in certain ecological contexts."
