It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its elongated leaves, which are typically longer than those of the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
