It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), and this species is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
