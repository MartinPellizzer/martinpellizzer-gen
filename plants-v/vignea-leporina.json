    "intro": "Vignea leporina, commonly known as the rabbit bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into slender, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Vignea leporina is often cultivated for its edible beans, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Its botanical significance also lies in its role as a forage crop and its use in traditional medicine."
