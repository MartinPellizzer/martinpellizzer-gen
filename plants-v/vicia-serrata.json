It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia serrata is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grassy areas and along woodland edges. It is a nitrogen-fixing plant, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
