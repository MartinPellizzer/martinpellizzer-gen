    "intro": "Vicia cretica var. aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
