    "intro": "Verbascum kanitzianum, commonly known as the Kanitz's mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum kanitzianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
