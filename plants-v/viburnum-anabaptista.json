    "intro": "Viburnum anabaptista, commonly known as the white cranesbill, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds. Viburnum anabaptista typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
