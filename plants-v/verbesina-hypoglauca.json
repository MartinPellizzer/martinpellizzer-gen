    "intro": "Verbesina hypoglauca, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small crowns, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, making it a striking addition to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
