    "intro": "Viscum stipitatum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing habitat for various insects and birds. Viscum stipitatum is widely distributed across the northern hemisphere, particularly in temperate regions."
