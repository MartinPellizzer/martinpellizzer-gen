    "intro": "Vicia peregrina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are small, pale yellow to white, and typically appear in clusters along the stems. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization through its nitrogen-fixing ability."
