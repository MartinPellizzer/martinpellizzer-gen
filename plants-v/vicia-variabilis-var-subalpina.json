    "intro": "Vicia variabilis var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Vicia variabilis var. subalpina is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
