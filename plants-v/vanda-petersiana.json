    "intro": "Vanda petersiana, commonly known as the Petersian vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Vanda petersiana thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
