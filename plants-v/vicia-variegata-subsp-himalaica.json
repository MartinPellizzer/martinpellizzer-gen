    "intro": "Vicia variegata subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native environments."
