    "intro": "Veronica dasyphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
