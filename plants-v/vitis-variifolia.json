    "intro": "Vitis variifolia, commonly known as the variable grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis variifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs using its tendrils. It is a valuable plant for ecological studies due to its morphological variability and role in local ecosystems."
