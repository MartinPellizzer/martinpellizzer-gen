    "intro": "Vriesea vittata, commonly known as the Tiger Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a tall, erect stem with vibrant, strap-like leaves that are often striped with red and green patterns. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea vittata is a popular choice for indoor gardens due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
