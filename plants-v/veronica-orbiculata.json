    "intro": "Veronica orbiculata, commonly known as the rounded speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming growth that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers clustered in terminal sprays, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and slightly hairy, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Veronica orbiculata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
