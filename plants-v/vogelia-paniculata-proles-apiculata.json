    "intro": "Vogelia paniculata proles apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicled vogelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small insects."
