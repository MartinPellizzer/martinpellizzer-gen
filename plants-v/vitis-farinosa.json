    "intro": "Vitis farinosa, commonly known as the prickly vine or sandvine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial vine that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but have a bland taste. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered with fine, prickly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vitis farinosa is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
