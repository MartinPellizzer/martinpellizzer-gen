    "intro": "Vitenia edulis, commonly known as the edible fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into edible fruits. The fruit, which is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or red when mature, is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, fig-like flavor. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible produce."
