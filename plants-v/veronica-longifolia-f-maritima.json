    "intro": "Veronica longifolia f. maritima, commonly known as the sea helene, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along cliffs and dunes. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces spikes of blue or purple flowers in late spring to summer. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well-suited for coastal environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
