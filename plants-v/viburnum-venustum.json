    "intro": "Viburnum venustum, commonly known as the white-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by showy, white to pinkish berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal changes in foliage and fruit, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Viburnum venustum prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in a variety of garden settings."
