    "intro": "Vitex pallida, commonly known as white chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale purple flowers in clustered panicles during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
