It features clusters of fragrant, white, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a glossy green upper surface. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, with a rounded form and dense foliage. This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for ornamental landscaping due to its attractive flowers and berries."
