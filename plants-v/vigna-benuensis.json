It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, round seeds. Vigna benuensis is adapted to grow in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
