    "intro": "Vandesia, commonly known as the orchid genus, is a diverse group of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers with three sepals, three petals, and a specialized structure called the labellum. Vandesia species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas, and are prized for their ornamental value. Many species within this genus are cultivated for their vibrant colors and unique floral structures."
