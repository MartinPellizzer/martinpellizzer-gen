It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety down. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are known to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viola palatina prefers moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in partial to full shade."
