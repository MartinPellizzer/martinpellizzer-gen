    "intro": "Valiha, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Asia, Europe, and North America. Valiha has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
