    "intro": "Viridantha teloloapanensis, commonly known as the Teloloapan greenbark tree, is a species native to the humid tropical forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green bark that provides a unique visual contrast to its broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
