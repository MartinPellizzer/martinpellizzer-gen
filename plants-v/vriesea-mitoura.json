    "intro": "Vriesea mitoura, commonly known as the Mitoura's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that resembles a torch, often in shades of orange and red. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, supporting a micro-ecosystem. Vriesea mitoura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
