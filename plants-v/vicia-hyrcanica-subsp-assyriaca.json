It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
