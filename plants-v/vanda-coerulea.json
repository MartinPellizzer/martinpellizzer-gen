    "intro": "Vanda coerulea, commonly known as the blue vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a contrasting white or yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda coerulea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
