    "intro": "Vicia vicina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are small, typically pale yellow or white, and are borne in clusters along the stem. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
