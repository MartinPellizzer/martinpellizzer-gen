    "intro": "Vittaria exigua, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Vittaria exigua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
