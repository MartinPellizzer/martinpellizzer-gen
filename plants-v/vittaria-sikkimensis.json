    "intro": "Vittaria sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
