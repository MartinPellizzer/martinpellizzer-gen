    "intro": "Verbascum alopecuroides, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad, velvety, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry gardens. This species is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
