    "intro": "Velleruca setulosa, commonly known as the hairy cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, hairy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. Its succulent stems are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. Velleruca setulosa is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
