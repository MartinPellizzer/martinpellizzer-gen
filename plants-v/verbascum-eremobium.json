    "intro": "Verbascum eremobium, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Verbascum eremobium is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
