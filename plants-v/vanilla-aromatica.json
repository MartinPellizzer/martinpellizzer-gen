    "intro": "Vanilla aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, twisting stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species. Its most notable feature is the development of vanilla pods, which are harvested and cured to produce the highly valued vanilla flavoring. The botanical structure of Vanilla aromatica supports its role as an important commercial crop in the global food and fragrance industries."
