    "intro": "Vriesea macrantha, commonly known as the giant vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant orange and red bracts. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Vriesea macrantha is popular as a ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
