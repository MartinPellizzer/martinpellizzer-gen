It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Velleia pubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
