    "intro": "Verbesina flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina flavovirens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands."
