    "intro": "Volkensia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays a unique role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
