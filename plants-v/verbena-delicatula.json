It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
