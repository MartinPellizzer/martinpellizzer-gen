    "intro": "Vernonia bardanoides, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), and this species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
