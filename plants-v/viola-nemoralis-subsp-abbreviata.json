    "intro": "Viola nemoralis subsp. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or white. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and abbreviated stem structure, which distinguishes it from other viola species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
