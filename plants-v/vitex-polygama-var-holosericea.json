    "intro": "Vitex polygama var. holosericea, commonly known as the silky ash or silky vitex, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
