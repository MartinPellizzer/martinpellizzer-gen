    "intro": "Vernonia altissima var. laxa, commonly known as tall ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, lavender-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
