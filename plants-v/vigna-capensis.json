    "intro": "Vigna capensis, commonly known as the African bean or climbing nightshade, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein and nutrients. Vigna capensis thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often grown for both food and ornamental purposes. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it a valuable crop in sustainable agricultural systems."
