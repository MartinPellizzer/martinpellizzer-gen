    "intro": "Vulpia stipoides, commonly known as the slender vulpia, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it often blooms from late spring to early autumn. Vulpia stipoides is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
