It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a narrow, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Vitex multiflora is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
