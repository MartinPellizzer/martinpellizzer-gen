    "intro": "Vanda lamellata var. calayana, commonly known as the Calayana Vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flower structure includes a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
