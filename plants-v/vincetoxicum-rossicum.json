    "intro": "Vincetoxicum rossicum, commonly known as Russian hogweed, is a tall perennial plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
