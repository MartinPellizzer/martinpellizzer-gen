It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Viburnum stipitatum typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes."
