    "intro": "Vaccinium cespitosum var. cuneifolium, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed, contributing to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are small and blue-black when mature, are edible and often used in local cuisine and traditional practices. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
