It produces small, clusters of greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by berries that ripen to a deep purple or black color. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and its robust root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Vitis occidentalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has potential for use in winemaking."
