It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Vicia formosa is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
