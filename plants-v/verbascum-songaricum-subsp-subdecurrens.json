    "intro": "Verbascum songaricum subsp. subdecurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features large, gray-green, velvety leaves that are lanceolate and often have a wavy margin. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the familiar mullein plant, though it is a distinct subspecies with narrower foliage."
