    "intro": "Virgulus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Virgulus carolinianus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
