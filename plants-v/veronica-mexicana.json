It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. Veronica mexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
