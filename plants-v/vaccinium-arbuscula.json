    "intro": "Vaccinium arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. Its dense foliage and compact growth make it suitable for erosion control and as a ground cover in coastal landscapes. Vaccinium arbuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance to native wildlife."
