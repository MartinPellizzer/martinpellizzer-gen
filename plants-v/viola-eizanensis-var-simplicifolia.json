    "intro": "Viola eizanensis var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the Eizan violet, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and showy purple-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
