    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia f. dageletiana, commonly known as the Dageletian valerian, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant characterized by its unique foliage and floral structure. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to the Andean region of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological differences from the typical form of Valeriana sambucifolia, making it a subject of interest in horticultural and taxonomic studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
