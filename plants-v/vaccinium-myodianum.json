    "intro": "Vaccinium myodianum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
