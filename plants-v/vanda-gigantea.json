    "intro": "Vanda gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are thick and absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to grow on trees or rocks. Vanda gigantea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
