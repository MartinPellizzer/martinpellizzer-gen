    "intro": "Vicia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, hairy pods containing several seeds. Vicia intermedia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability makes it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
