    "intro": "Vigna aconitifolia, commonly known as the black gram or urad, is an annual leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its seeds are rich in protein and are widely used in cuisines across South and Southeast Asia. Additionally, Vigna aconitifolia plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
