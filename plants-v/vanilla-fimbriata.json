    "intro": "Vanilla fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that contain the aromatic vanilla beans used in cooking and perfumery. Vanilla fimbriata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and fragrance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
