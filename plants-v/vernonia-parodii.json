    "intro": "Vernonia parodii, commonly known as the Parodii ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Vernonia parodii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
