    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that lack the hairy texture typical of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its low-growing habit and rapid growth, it is considered a weed in cultivated areas."
