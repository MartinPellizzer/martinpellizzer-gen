    "intro": "Virola venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
