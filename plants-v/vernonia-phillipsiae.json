    "intro": "Vernonia phillipsiae, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green to reddish flowers, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Vernonia phillipsiae plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the Hawaiian environment."
