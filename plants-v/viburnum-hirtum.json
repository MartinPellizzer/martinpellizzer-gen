It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also known for its fragrant foliage and adaptability to partial shade."
