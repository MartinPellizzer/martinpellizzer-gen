    "intro": "Vandellia repens, commonly known as the creeping vandellia, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its small, greenish-white flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences, and the leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly hairy surface. Vandellia repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
