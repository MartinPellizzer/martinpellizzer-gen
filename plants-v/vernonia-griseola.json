    "intro": "Vernonia griseola, commonly known as grayleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its showy purple to pinkish flower heads bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia griseola is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
