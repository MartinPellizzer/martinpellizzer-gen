    "intro": "Vicia japonica var. silvatica, commonly known as Japanese vetch, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
