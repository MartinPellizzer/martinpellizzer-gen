    "intro": "Vicia paposana, commonly known as the Mexican vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia paposana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
