    "intro": "Vicia graminea var. graminea, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stem. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive hairy texture. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
