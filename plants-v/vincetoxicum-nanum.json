    "intro": "Vincetoxicum nanum, commonly known as dwarf smoketree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, rounded foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin. Vincetoxicum nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
