    "intro": "Vicia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Vicia heterophylla is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
