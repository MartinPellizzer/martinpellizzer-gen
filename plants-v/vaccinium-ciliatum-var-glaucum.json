    "intro": "Vaccinium ciliatum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous blueberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its berries are edible, though they are generally small and have a tart, acidic flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
