It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its scientific name reflects its prostrate growth habit and its association with the heliotrope genus. Velaea decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
