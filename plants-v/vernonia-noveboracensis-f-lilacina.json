The plant produces dense clusters of small, dark purple to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial suitable for gardens and natural landscapes. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects and ornamental gardens alike."
