    "intro": "Vaccinium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak heather, is a species of flowering plant native to Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and evergreen plants. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in forest understories. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces berries that are edible for some wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
