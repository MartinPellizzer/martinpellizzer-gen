    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 javorkae, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy, woolly leaves. The hybrid exhibits characteristics of its parent species, typically featuring tall, erect stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, downy hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
