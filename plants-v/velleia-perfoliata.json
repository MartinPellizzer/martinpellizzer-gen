    "intro": "Velleia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate velleia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Velleia perfoliata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. Its unique leaf structure, where the leaves appear to be pierced by the stem, gives it a distinctive appearance."
