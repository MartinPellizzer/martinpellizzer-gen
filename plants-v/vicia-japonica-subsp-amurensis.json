It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems that produce small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
