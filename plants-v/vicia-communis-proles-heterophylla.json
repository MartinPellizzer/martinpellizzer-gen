    "intro": "Vicia communis proles heterophylla, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which gives it the specific epithet \"heterophylla,\" meaning \"different leaves.\" The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet, depending on the variety. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
