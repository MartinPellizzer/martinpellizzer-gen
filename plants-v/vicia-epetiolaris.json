    "intro": "Vicia epetiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in elongated clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and rocky soils. Vicia epetiolaris is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
