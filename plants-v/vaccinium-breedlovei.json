    "intro": "Vaccinium breedlovei, commonly known as the Hawaiian huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other heath plants, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are a significant food source for native birds and insects. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, and it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Vaccinium breedlovei plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems and is considered a rare and endangered species."
