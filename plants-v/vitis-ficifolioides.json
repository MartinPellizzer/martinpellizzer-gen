The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and historical purposes. Vitis ficifolioides is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
