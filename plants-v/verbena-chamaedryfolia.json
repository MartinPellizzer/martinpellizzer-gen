It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular, blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Verbena chamaedryfolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
