    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrya, commonly known as upright speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers throughout the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to both wildflower meadows and cultivated landscapes."
