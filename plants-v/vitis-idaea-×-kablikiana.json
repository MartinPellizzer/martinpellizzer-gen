    "intro": "Vitis-idaea \u00d7 kablikiana, commonly known as the trailing partridgeberry, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. Its creeping growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments make it a common understory plant in forests. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
