    "intro": "Veronica ovata var. kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of native flora."
