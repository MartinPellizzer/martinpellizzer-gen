    "intro": "Viburnum hessei, commonly known as the Hessei viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum hessei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
