    "intro": "Verbascum trichostylum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum trichostylum is a perennial herb that is well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
