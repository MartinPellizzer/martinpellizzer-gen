It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The berries, which are typically blue or purple when mature, are edible and often used in culinary applications."
