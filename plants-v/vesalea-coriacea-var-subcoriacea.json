    "intro": "Vesalea coriacea var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved vesalea, is a variant of the vesalea genus native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are often pale green or white in color. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
