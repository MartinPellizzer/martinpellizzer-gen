    "intro": "Viola kohalana, commonly known as the Hawaiian violet, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom from late winter to early spring, and it is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Viola kohalana is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
