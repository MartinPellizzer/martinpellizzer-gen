    "intro": "Vangueriopsis shimbaensis, commonly known as Shimba Island vangueriopsis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly the Shimba Hills in Kenya. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
