    "intro": "Viola doerfleri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble orchids, with petals that are often violet or white in color. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically growing from a short, rhizomatous rootstock. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Viola doerfleri is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
