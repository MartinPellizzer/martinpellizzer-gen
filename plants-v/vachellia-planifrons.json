    "intro": "Vachellia planifrons, commonly known as the flat-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of small, paired leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Vachellia planifrons is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
