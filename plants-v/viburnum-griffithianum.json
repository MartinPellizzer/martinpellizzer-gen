It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy floral displays. Viburnum griffithianum thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
