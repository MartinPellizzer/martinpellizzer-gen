    "intro": "Vitis curvipoda, commonly known as the curly vine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to parts of North America, particularly the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its tendrils that curl around supports, allowing it to climb and spread vertically. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. The berries that follow are usually dark blue to black, and they are edible but often have a tart flavor."
