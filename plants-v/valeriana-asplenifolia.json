    "intro": "Valeriana asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that resemble those of a fern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Valeriana asplenifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its aromatic foliage has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its calming properties."
