    "intro": "Vicia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Vicia tricolor is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
