    "intro": "Veronica ritteriana, commonly known as the Ritter's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Veronica ritteriana is considered a rare and endangered species."
