    "intro": "Verbesina chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's scientific name honors the botanist John Chapman, reflecting its historical significance in botanical studies."
