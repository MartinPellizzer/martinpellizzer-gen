    "intro": "Viola arenaria var. glabrescens, commonly known as the sandy violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that become smooth as the plant matures, and it produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with yellow markings. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to bloom in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other viola species."
