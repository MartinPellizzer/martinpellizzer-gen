    "intro": "Verbena aubletia var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, and violet, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slight pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Drummond's verbena is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
