    "intro": "Vernonia noveboracensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower ironweed, is a variant of the common ironweed native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The floral structure consists of tubular florets arranged in a panicle, making it a valuable plant for pollinators and a striking addition to native gardens."
