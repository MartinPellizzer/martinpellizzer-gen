    "intro": "Vernonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, dark purple to brownish-red flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Vernonia sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
