    "intro": "Veronica olsenii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
