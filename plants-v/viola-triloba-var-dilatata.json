It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive violet or purple underside. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of purple, violet, or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
