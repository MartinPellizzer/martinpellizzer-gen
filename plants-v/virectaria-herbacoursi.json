    "intro": "Virectaria herbacoursi, commonly known as the creeping virectaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in a mat-like fashion. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. Virectaria herbacoursi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
