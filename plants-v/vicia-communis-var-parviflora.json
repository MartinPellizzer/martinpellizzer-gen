    "intro": "Vicia communis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is often cultivated as a forage crop due to its nutritional value for livestock."
