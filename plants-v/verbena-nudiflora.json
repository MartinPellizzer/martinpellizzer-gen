    "intro": "Verbena nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-stem verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought resistance. Verbena nudiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
