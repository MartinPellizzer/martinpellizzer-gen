It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
