It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Vitex tomentosa is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
