    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is a perennial species that spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. The leaves are often broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name \"reniformis,\" meaning kidney-shaped."
