    "intro": "Verbesina costata, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely toothed leaves and a branched stem that often grows in dry, open habitats. Its scientific name reflects the serrated edges of its leaves, derived from the Latin \"costa,\" meaning ridge or border. Verbesina costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
