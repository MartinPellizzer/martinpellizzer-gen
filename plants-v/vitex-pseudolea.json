It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, two-valved capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Vitex pseudolea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
