    "intro": "Veronica falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in loose racemes, blooming from late spring to early summer. Veronica falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
