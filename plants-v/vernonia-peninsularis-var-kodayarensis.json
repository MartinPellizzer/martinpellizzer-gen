    "intro": "Vernonia peninsularis var. kodayarensis, commonly known as the Kodayar vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow-green to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers bloom from September to November. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
