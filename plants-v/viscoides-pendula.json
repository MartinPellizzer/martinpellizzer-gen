    "intro": "Viscoides pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a light green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
