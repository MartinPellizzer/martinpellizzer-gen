    "intro": "Vanda funingensis, commonly known as the Funing orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or other structures. Vanda funingensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
