    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. thouinii, commonly known as the Thouin grape, is a rare and ancient variety of grapevine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark berries and is often considered a wild ancestor of many cultivated grape varieties. The plant exhibits robust woody stems and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its potential in viticultural research. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and wine enthusiasts alike."
