    "intro": "Valerianella fusiformis, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color and emit a distinctive, slightly sour aroma. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported soothing properties. Valerianella fusiformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides."
