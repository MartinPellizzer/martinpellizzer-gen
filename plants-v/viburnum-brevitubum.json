    "intro": "Viburnum brevitubum, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum brevitubum thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
