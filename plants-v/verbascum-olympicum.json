    "intro": "Verbascum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic mullein, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike at the top of the stem. Its common name comes from its association with the Olympic Mountains in Greece, where it is found in rocky, alpine habitats. Verbascum olympicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
