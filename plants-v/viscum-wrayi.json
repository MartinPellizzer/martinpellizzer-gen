    "intro": "Viscum wrayi, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in southern Africa. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent. Viscum wrayi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting biodiversity through its fruit and habitat."
