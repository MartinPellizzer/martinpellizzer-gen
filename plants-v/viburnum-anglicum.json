    "intro": "Viburnum anglicum, commonly known as English hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. Its bark is often fissured and has a rough, grayish texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively. Viburnum anglicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
