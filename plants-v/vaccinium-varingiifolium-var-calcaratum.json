    "intro": "Vaccinium varingiifolium var. calcaratum, commonly known as the sandhill blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to purple in color. Its leaves are elliptical with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
