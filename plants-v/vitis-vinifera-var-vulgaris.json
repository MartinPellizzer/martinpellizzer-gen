    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common grapevine, is a woody vine native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It produces clusters of small, usually purple or green berries that are the primary source of table grapes and wine grapes. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The common grapevine is highly valued for its fruit, which is used in winemaking, fresh consumption, and various culinary applications."
