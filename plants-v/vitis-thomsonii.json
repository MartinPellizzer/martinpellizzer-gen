    "intro": "Vitis thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's grape, is a rare North American vine belonging to the Vitaceae family. It is native to the Appalachian Mountains and thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive blue-black berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with coarsely toothed margins, and it has tendrils for climbing. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
