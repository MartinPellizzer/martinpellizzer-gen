    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its berries are typically blue or black when mature and are edible, though often used in local foraging traditions. This variety is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
