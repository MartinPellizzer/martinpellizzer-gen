    "intro": "Vernonia baccharoides, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a shrub native to the eastern and southern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. Vernonia baccharoides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
