    "intro": "Vaccinium pennellii, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically reaches a height of less than 30 centimeters, with dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Vaccinium pennellii is an important food source for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
