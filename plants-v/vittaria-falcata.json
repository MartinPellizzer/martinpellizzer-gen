    "intro": "Vittaria falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance."
