    "intro": "Vitis riparia var. praecox, commonly known as the early river grape, is a wild vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found along riverbanks and in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in viticulture for its cold hardiness and potential for hybridization."
