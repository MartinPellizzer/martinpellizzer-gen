    "intro": "Vicia benghalensis, commonly known as the Indian vetch, is a leguminous plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Vicia benghalensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
