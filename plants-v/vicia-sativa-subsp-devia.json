    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. devia, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Vicia sativa subsp. devia is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
