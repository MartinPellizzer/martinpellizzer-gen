    "intro": "Veronica rosea subsp. chartonii, commonly known as the chartonii speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
