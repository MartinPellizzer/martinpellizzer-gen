    "intro": "Vaccinium bracteatum var. obovatum, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. These berries are often used in jams and jellies due to their tart flavor. The shrub thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and pine flatwoods."
