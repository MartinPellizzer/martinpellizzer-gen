These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Vorstia species are characterized by their fragrant, showy flowers that often have a unique, sweet scent. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The leaves are usually elongated and waxy, adapting to the humid and shaded environments where they thrive."
