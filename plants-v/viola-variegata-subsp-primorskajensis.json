    "intro": "Viola variegata subsp. primorskajensis, commonly known as the Primorsky viola, is a perennial herb native to the Far East of Russia and parts of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower one often being a different color, a feature common in the Viola genus. The subspecies is distinguished by its variegated leaf patterns and slightly smaller flowers compared to other Viola species."
