    "intro": "Vincentia crinita, commonly known as the hairy vining legume, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features slender, twining stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its hot, arid habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are often hairy on the underside. Vincentia crinita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
