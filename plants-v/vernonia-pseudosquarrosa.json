It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
