    "intro": "Vicia saffordii, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Vicia saffordii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
