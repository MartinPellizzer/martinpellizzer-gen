    "intro": "Vanda tricolor var. patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored flowers that typically display shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy, long-lasting blooms."
