    "intro": "Vicia \u00d7 guyotii, commonly known as the hybrid vetch, is a perennial legume that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Vicia faba and Vicia sativa. It typically produces trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Vicia \u00d7 guyotii is also cultivated as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value for livestock."
