    "intro": "Verbena sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Verbena sarmentosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
