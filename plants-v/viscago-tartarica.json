    "intro": "Viscago tartarica, commonly known as the Tartarian gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the genus *Ribes* in the family *Polygonaceae*, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tart berries. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often with a waxy coating. Viscago tartarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
