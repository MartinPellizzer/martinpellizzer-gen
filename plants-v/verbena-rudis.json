    "intro": "Verbena rudis, commonly known as sea verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, and pink, which bloom throughout the summer. Its foliage is narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Verbena rudis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
