    "intro": "Vicia unguiculata subsp. calcarata, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lanceolate leaflets, and the plant has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes. Vicia unguiculata subsp. calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
