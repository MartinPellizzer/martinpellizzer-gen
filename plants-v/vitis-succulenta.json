It is characterized by its thin, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are usually heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Vitis succulenta thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
