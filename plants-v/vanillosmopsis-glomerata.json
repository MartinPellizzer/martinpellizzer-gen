    "intro": "Vanillosmopsis glomerata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic bark and dense, dark red to reddish-brown heartwood. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
