    "intro": "Viscum kunthianum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its symbiotic relationship with host trees is essential for its survival and propagation. Viscum kunthianum is native to South America and is often found in humid, forested areas."
