It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by egg-shaped berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
