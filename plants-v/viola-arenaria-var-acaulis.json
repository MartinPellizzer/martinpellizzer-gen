    "intro": "Viola arenaria var. acaulis, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base, which is adapted for pollination by bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover plant."
