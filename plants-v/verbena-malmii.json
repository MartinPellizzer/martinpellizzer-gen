    "intro": "Verbena malmii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Verbena malmii is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
