    "intro": "Vittaria pumila, commonly known as the little maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of the more well-known maidenhair ferns. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Vittaria pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
