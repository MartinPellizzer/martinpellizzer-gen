    "intro": "Vanda lombokensis, commonly known as the Lombok vanda, is a species of orchid native to the Indonesian island of Lombok. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Vanda lombokensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
