    "intro": "Vangueriella glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth vangueriella, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
