    "intro": "Vaccinium scabrum, commonly known as rough blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, tart blue berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its leaves are dark green and covered in fine, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. Vaccinium scabrum is often found in boreal forests and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
