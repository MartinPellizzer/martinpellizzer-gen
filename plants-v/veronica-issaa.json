    "intro": "Veronica issaa, commonly known as the blueweed or coastal veronica, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Veronica issaa is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish."
