    "intro": "Viola cordulata, commonly known as the heartleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green and slightly hairy, with a distinctive cordate (heart-like) shape. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple or violet, often with a yellow throat, during the spring months. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Viola cordulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
