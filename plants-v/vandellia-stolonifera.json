    "intro": "Vandellia stolonifera, commonly known as the rock wallaby-rush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Vandellia stolonifera is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of rivers, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
