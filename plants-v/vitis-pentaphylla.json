    "intro": "Vitis pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf grape, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible, sweet berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Vitis pentaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
