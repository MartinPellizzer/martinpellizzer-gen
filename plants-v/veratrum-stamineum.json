    "intro": "Veratrum stamineum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features tall, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It is characterized by its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care."
