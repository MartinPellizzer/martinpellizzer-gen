    "intro": "Vanda flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation. Vanda flabellata is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
