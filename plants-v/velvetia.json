It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Velvetia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
