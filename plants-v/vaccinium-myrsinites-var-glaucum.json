It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which develop into edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and heathlands."
