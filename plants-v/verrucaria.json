    "intro": "Verrucaria, commonly known as the \"sponge-like lichen,\" is a genus of foliose lichens characterized by their thallus structure that resembles a sponge or a crust. These lichens are typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or decaying wood in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is composed of a network of hyphae that form a dense, irregularly branched layer. Verrucaria species are often covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving them a distinctive, uneven appearance. They are chemically diverse, producing various secondary metabolites that contribute to their ecological roles and interactions with the environment."
