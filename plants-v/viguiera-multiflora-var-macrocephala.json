It features showy, daisy-like yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
