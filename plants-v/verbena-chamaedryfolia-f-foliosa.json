    "intro": "Verbena chamaedryfolia f. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy verbena, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are densely arranged along the stems, giving it a distinctive, foliage-heavy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and drought tolerance."
