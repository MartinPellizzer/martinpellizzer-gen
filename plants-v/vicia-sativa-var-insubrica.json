    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. insubrica, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
