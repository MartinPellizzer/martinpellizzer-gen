It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, velvety leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Vouay thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to bloom indoors with proper care."
