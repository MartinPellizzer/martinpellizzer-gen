    "intro": "Viola microphylla f. fimbriata, commonly known as the fimbriated violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and delicate, fragrant flowers that range from violet to pale blue. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches, with a compact, bushy habit. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are characterized by their finely frayed edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
