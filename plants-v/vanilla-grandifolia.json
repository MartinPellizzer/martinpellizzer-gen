    "intro": "Vanilla grandifolia, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by a specific bee species, the Melipona bee. The plant's most valuable part is its fruit, the vanilla pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pods are harvested and undergo a complex curing process to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor. Vanilla grandifolia is widely cultivated for its use in food, fragrance, and medicine."
