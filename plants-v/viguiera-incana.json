    "intro": "Viguiera incana, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 to 3 meters tall, featuring silvery-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple composite flower heads in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Viguiera incana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
