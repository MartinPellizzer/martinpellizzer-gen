    "intro": "Vernonia kapolowensis, commonly known as the Kapolowensis ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
