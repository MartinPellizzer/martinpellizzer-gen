    "intro": "Villarsia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved villarsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It is a shrub that grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
