    "intro": "Vitis riparia var. syrticola, commonly known as the syrticola river grape, is a wild grapevine native to the central United States. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and distinctive heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically green when mature, though they may show slight color changes depending on the variety. It is often found along riverbanks and in moist, fertile soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in viticultural research and hybridization programs."
