    "intro": "Vernonia sparrei, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia sparrei plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
