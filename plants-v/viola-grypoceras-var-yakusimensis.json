It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and showy, five-petaled blooms that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
