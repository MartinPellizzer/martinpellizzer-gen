    "intro": "Vernonia farinosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white powder, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Vernonia farinosa is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid environments."
