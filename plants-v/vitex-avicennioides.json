It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal environments. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
