It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vinticena flavicans is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
