    "intro": "Vernonia parishii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It produces small, purple to yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
