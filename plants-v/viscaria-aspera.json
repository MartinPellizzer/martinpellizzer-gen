    "intro": "Viscaria aspera, commonly known as the rough viscaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Viscaria aspera is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
