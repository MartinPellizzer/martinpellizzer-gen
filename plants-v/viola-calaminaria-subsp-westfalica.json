It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland edges and meadows. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue or purple flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. It is closely related to other viola species and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
