    "intro": "Viola prionantha, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale violet petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its unique common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola prionantha is considered a species of conservation concern."
