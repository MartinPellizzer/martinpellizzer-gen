    "intro": "Vincetoxicum montanum, commonly known as mountain nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are typically red and appear in the autumn. Vincetoxicum montanum is often found in rocky or woodland soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
