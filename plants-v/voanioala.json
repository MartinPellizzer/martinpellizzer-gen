    "intro": "Voanioala, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have tall, erect stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Voanioala species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid, shaded environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are popular in horticultural collections."
