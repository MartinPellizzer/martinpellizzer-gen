    "intro": "Veratrum bohnhofii var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
