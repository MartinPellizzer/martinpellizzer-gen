It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Verbesina soratae is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
