    "intro": "Vicia vestita var. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
