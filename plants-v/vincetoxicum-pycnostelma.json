    "intro": "Vincetoxicum pycnostelma, commonly known as the dense-stalked twinleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in moist soils with partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
