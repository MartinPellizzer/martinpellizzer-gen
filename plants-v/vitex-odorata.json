    "intro": "Vitex odorata, commonly known as chaste tree or vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, brown seeds. Vitex odorata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
