    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvinaria. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
