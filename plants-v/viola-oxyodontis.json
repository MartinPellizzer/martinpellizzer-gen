    "intro": "Viola oxyodontis, commonly known as the sand viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
