    "intro": "Vicia hybrida, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. Vicia hybrida is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
