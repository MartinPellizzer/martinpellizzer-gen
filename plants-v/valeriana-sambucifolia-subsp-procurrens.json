    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia subsp. procurrens, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
