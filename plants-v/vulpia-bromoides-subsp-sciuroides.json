    "intro": "Vulpia bromoides subsp. sciuroides, commonly known as the smooth vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
