    "intro": "Vernonia vargasii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
