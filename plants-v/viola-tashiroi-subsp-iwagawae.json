    "intro": "Viola tashiroi subsp. iwagawae, commonly known as the Iwagawae violet, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
