    "intro": "Vincetoxicum trichoneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
