It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive violet, yellow, and white coloration. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals that often display a striking color contrast. This subspecies is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
