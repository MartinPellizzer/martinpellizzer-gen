It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnate with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, curved pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas.
