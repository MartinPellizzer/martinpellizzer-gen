It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, arranged in loose clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive grooved appearance on the underside. Valeriana sulcata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
