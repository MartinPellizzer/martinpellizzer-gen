    "intro": "Vernonia chevalieri, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Vernonia chevalieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for native insects."
