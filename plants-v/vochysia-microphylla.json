    "intro": "Vochysia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved velvetwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are often followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Vochysia microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to rainforest and tropical garden landscapes."
