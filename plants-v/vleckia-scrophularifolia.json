    "intro": "Vleckia scrophularifolia, commonly known as the rock mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically erect and covered in fine hairs, providing structural support in rocky habitats. Vleckia scrophularifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
