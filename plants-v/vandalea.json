    "intro": "Vandalea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The genus comprises several species, most of which are characterized by their delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Vandalea plants typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils and are often found in alpine environments. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Vandalea are considered endangered."
