    "intro": "Valeriana triloba, commonly known as three-lobed valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, trifoliate leaves with three oval to lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. Valeriana triloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
