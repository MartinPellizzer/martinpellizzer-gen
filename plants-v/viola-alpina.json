    "intro": "Viola alpina, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, often with dark markings. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Viola alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
