    "intro": "Viburnum wrightii var. lucidum, commonly known as the shining arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist woodland habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
