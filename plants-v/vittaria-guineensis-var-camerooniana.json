    "intro": "Vittaria guineensis var. camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its rosette-like fronds that form a dense, cushion-like structure, often resembling a staghorn in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
