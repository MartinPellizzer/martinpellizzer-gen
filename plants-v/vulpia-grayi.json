    "intro": "Vulpia grayi, commonly known as gray's vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial plant with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Vulpia grayi is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
