    "intro": "Vitaliana chionotricha, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vitaliana chionotricha plays a role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
