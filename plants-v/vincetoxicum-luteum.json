    "intro": "Vincetoxicum luteum, commonly known as yellow woodbine, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks, often climbing trees or shrubs. Its ornamental value is limited due to its invasive tendencies in some regions."
