    "intro": "Verbascum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stem mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, leafless stem that emerges directly from the base, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, gray-green, and covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. Verbascum acaule is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas."
