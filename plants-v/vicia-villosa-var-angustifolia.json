    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some agricultural settings for soil stabilization."
