It belongs to the Valantia genus, which is part of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often edible members. The plant features a slender, upright stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Valantia pedemontana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters."
