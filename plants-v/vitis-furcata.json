    "intro": "Vitis furcata, commonly known as the split grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. Vitis furcata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also a host plant for several species of native butterflies and moths."
