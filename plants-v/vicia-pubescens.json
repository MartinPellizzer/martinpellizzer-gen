    "intro": "Vicia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia pubescens is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant in both agricultural and natural settings."
