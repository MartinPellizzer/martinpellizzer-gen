    "intro": "Viola tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces underground tubers, which serve as storage organs and are used for propagation. Viola tuberosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
