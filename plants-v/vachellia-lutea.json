    "intro": "Vachellia lutea, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Vachellia lutea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
