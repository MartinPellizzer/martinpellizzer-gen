    "intro": "Verbena origenes var. glabriflora, commonly known as the smoothflower vervain, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabriflora' has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its short growing season and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to pollinator habitats."
