    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils."
