    "intro": "Vilfa procera, commonly known as the tall fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it a striking appearance in its natural habitat. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the seeds necessary for reproduction. Vilfa procera is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
