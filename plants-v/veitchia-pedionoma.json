    "intro": "Veitchia pedionoma, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
