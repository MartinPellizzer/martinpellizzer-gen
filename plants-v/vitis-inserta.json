    "intro": "Vitis inserta, commonly known as the Chinese grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The small, greenish-yellow flowers give way to berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor."
