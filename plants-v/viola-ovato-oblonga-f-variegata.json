    "intro": "Viola ovato-oblonga f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated heartleaf violet, is a hybrid viola species characterized by its distinctive foliage. The leaves are ovate-oblong, with a broad, rounded base and a pointed tip, and often exhibit a striking variegation pattern of white and green. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its charming, fragrant blossoms."
