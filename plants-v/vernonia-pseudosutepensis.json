It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
