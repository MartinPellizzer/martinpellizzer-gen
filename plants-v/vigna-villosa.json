    "intro": "Vigna villosa, commonly known as hairy vigna, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly pubescent texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vigna villosa is often grown as a forage crop or for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
