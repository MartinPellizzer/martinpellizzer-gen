    "intro": "Viola aprica, commonly known as the spring viola, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and violet, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Viola aprica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
