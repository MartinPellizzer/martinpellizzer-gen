This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. It produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous leaves and stems have been historically used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
