It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It is a perennial shrub that produces fragrant flowers from late spring to early autumn. The variety 'contracta' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other verbena species."
