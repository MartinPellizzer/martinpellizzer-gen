    "intro": "Vanda fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive fringed appearance on the petals. Vanda fimbriata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
