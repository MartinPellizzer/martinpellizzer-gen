    "intro": "Vicia villosa proles godronii, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Vicia villosa proles godronii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
