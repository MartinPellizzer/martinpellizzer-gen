    "intro": "Verbesina fastigiata, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads in late summer to early fall, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Verbesina fastigiata is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
