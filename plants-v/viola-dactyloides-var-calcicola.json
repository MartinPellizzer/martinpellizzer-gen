It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
