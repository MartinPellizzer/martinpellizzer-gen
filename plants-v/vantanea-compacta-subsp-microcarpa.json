    "intro": "Vantanea compacta subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
