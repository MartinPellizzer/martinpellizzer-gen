    "intro": "Virola obovata, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Virola obovata is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly resistant to decay and used in construction and furniture. It also plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
