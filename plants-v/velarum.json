    "intro": "Velarum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Velarum is native to the Americas and is commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
