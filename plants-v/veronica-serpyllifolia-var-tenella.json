    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. tenella, commonly known as carpet grass or common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along paths. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and restoration projects."
