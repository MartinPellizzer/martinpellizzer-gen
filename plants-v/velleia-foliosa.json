    "intro": "Velleia foliosa, commonly known as the silverleaf velleia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, silver-tomentose leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Velleia foliosa is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
