    "intro": "Vicia capitata, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Vicia capitata is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has small, trifoliate leaves and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
