    "intro": "Vicilla orobus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are short-lived, typically blooming for only a few days before fading. Vicilla orobus is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
