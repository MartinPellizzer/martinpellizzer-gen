    "intro": "Viscum obscurum, commonly known as the obscure mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the eastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum obscurum is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in the canopy of forests. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees."
