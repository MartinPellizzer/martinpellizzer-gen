    "intro": "Vicia dumicola, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Vicia dumicola is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
