    "intro": "Valeriana uliginosa, commonly known as swamp valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are narrow, dark green, and slightly hairy. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in late summer. Swamp valerian is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its calming effects."
