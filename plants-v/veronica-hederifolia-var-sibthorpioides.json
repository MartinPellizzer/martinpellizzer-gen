    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia var. sibthorpioides, commonly known as the sibthorpioid speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features trailing stems that produce small, blue or violet flowers clustered in pairs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are oval-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly wavy margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
