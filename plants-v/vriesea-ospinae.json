    "intro": "Vriesea ospinae, commonly known as the Ospina's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that can range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple stripe. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic lifestyle. Vriesea ospinae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
