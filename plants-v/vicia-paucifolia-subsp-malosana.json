    "intro": "Vicia paucifolia subsp. malosana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by slender, twisted pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
