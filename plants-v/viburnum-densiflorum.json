    "intro": "Viburnum densiflorum, commonly known as the thickflower viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most striking characteristic is its dense clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Viburnum densiflorum thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
