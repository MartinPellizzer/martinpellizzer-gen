    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. guillielmia, commonly known as the Guillielmia grape, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the European grapevine. It is characterized by its small, dark berries that are often used in winemaking due to their intense flavor profile. The plant exhibits robust growth and is relatively resistant to certain fungal diseases, making it a viable option for vineyards in temperate climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces clusters of fruit that ripen in late summer. This variety is valued for its aromatic qualities and potential in both culinary and viticultural applications."
