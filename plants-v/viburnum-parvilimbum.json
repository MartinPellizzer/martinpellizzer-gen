    "intro": "Viburnum parvilimbum, commonly known as the small-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Viburnum parvilimbum is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
