    "intro": "Vigna harmsii, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vigna harmsii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown for its edible seeds. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria."
