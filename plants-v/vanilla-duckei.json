    "intro": "Vanilla duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that develop from its flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate, spurred petals. Vanilla duckei is valued for its unique aroma and is sometimes used in small-scale culinary applications."
