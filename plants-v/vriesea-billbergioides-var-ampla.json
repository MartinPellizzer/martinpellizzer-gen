    "intro": "Vriesea billbergioides var. ampla, commonly known as the giant vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, vibrant green leaves that form a rosette shape, with a tall, branched inflorescence that bears bright orange and red bracts. The plant produces showy flowers in shades of orange, red, and yellow, which bloom sequentially along the inflorescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
