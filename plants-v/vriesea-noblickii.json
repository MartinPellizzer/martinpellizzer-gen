    "intro": "Vriesea noblickii, commonly known as the noble vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central reservoir for collecting rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically orange or red, bloom in late summer and can last for several months. Vriesea noblickii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
