    "intro": "Vitis thunbergii var. sinuata, commonly known as the Chinese grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five lance-shaped leaflets that are often sinuously curled, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to dark purple. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along trellises or other structures. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese horticulture."
