It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Virga is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seed pods, which contain edible seeds, are also used in traditional cuisines."
