    "intro": "Vesalea subcoriacea var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a coriaceous texture, and its stems are often covered in small spines. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is often found in the wild but can be cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
