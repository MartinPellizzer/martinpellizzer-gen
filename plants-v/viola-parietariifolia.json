    "intro": "Viola parietariifolia, commonly known as the cliff violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate violet or blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in crevices and on slopes, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viola parietariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
