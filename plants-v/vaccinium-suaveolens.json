    "intro": "Vaccinium suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented blueberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to white in color, and it bears edible, dark blue berries that are similar in taste to other blueberry species. Vaccinium suaveolens is often found in wetlands, hammocks, and pine flatwoods, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing food for birds and insects. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for gardeners in suitable climates."
