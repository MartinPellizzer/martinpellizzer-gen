    "intro": "Vulpia ciliata var. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common component of native plant communities in its range."
