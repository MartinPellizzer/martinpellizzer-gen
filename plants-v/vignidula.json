    "intro": "Vignidula, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Vignidula is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is often used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy, with seeds dispersed by wind after the pods mature."
