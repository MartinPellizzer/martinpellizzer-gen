It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
