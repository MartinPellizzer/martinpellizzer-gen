    "intro": "Vateria pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered vateria, is a rare and understudied plant species belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elongated, woody stems. It typically grows in lowland rainforests, often in shaded and humid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Vateria pauciflora remains a poorly understood species in botanical science."
