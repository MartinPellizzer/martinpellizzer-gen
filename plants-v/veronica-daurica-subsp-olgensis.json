    "intro": "Veronica daurica subsp. olgensis, commonly known as the Daurian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for garden cultivation in cooler regions."
