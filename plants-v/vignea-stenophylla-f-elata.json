    "intro": "Vignea stenophylla f. elata, commonly known as the slender-leafed vigna, is a variant of the species Vignea stenophylla, characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. Its botanical features make it suitable for cultivation in warm climates, though it is less commonly grown than other vigna species."
