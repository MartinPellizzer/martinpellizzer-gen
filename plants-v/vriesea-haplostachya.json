    "intro": "Vriesea haplostachya, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white, tubular flowers. Its rosette of broad, waxy leaves is adapted to collect and store water, a feature essential for survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Vriesea haplostachya is popular as a ornamental plant due to its long-lasting, showy display."
