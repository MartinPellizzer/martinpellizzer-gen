    "intro": "Vernoniastrum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies, and it thrives in full sun. Its broad, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Vernoniastrum latifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
