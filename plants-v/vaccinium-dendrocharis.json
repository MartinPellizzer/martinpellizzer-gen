It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually pink or white, blooming in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
