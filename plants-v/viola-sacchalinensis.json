It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate violet flowers with purple petals. It belongs to the Violaceae family, which includes other violets and related species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
