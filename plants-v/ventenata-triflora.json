    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, and it produces three flowers per spikelet, giving it its common name. Ventenata triflora is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
