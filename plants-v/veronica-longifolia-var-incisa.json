    "intro": "Veronica longifolia var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. The species is often used in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
