    "intro": "Vaccaria pyramidata, commonly known as the mountain vaccaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, cushion-like foliage that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Vaccaria pyramidata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
