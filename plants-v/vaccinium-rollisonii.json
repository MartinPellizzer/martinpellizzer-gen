    "intro": "Vaccinium rollisonii, commonly known as the Rollison huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, acidic berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
