    "intro": "Veronica cymbalaria subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its glandular structures on leaves and stems help in reducing water loss and may contribute to its adaptability in various habitats."
