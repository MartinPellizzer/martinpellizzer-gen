    "intro": "Vitis cordifolia var. vulpina, commonly known as the fox grape, is a perennial vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark blue to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in shaded forests. Its berries are edible but have a tart, somewhat bitter flavor. The vine is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
