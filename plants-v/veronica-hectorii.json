    "intro": "Veronica hectorii, commonly known as Hector's speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent salt spray. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
