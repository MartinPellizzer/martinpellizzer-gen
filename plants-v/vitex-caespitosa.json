    "intro": "Vitex caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping chaste tree, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a woody stem that often grows in dense, mat-like formations. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and showy floral display."
