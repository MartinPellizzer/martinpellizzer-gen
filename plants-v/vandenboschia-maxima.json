    "intro": "Vandenboschia maxima, commonly known as the giant quiver tree, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and reduce water loss through transpiration. Vandenboschia maxima is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
