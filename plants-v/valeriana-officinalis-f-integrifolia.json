    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat woody stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with smooth, entire margins. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are the primary source of the medicinal compounds, including valerenic acid, which contribute to its sedative and calming properties. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and traditional herbal remedies."
