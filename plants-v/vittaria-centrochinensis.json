    "intro": "Vittaria centrochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Vittaria centrochinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
