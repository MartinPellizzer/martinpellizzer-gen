    "intro": "Vincetoxicum tenerrimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vincetoxicum tenerrimum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread."
