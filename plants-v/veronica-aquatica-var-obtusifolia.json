    "intro": "Veronica aquatica var. obtusifolia, commonly known as water speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is characterized by its rounded leaf tips, distinguishing it from other Veronica species."
