    "intro": "Vanieria alternifolia, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots submerged in water and fronds emerging above the surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vanieria alternifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
