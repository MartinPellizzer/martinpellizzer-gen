    "intro": "Verbesina sordescens, commonly known as the blackleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its common name reflects the dark coloration of its leaves, which can vary in shade depending on environmental conditions."
