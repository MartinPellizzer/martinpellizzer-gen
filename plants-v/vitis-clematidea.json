It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. Vitis clematidea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade."
