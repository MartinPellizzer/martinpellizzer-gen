    "intro": "Velezia rigida, commonly known as the rigid velezia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Velezia rigida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
