    "intro": "Vanilla bradei, commonly known as the Bornean vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by dark brown pods containing the aromatic vanilla beans. These beans are harvested and used in the same way as traditional vanilla, though they are less commonly cultivated. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species within the orchid family."
