    "intro": "Vallisneria spiralis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf waterweed, is a compact aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of only a few centimeters. This variety is well adapted to slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small size makes it ideal for use in aquariums and ornamental water features. The plant reproduces through runners and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged."
