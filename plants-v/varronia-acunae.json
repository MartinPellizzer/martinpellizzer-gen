    "intro": "Varronia acunae, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright purple berries that are edible for humans and animals, though they are often described as having a slightly tart flavor. Varronia acunae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
