    "intro": "Vriesea brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from yellow to orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea brasiliana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
