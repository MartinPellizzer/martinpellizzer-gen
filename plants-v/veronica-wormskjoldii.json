    "intro": "Veronica wormskjoldii, commonly known as the dwarf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Veronica wormskjoldii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardiness."
