    "intro": "Vigna wittei, commonly known as the African horse bean, is a leguminous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces elongated pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds that are often used as food. Vigna wittei is adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
