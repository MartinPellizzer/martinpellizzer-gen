It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to diverse garden settings."
