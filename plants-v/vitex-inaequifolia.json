    "intro": "Vitex inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in size and shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex inaequifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
