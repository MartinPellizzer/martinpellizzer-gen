    "intro": "Vaccinium buergeri, commonly known as the Buerger's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky slopes. Vaccinium buergeri is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary use in local cuisines."
