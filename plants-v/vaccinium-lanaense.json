    "intro": "Vaccinium lanaense, commonly known as the Lanzan blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
