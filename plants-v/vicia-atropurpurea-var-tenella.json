    "intro": "Vicia atropurpurea var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf purple vetch, is a compact annual legume native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
