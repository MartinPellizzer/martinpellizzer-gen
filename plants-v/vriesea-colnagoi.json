    "intro": "Vriesea colnagoi, commonly known as the Colnago's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, often including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea colnagoi is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
