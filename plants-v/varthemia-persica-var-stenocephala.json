    "intro": "Varthemia persica var. stenocephala, commonly known as Persian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
