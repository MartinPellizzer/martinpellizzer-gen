    "intro": "Valerianella gioelbaschiensis, commonly known as the Gioelbaschi valerian, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Italy, particularly in the Dolomites. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
