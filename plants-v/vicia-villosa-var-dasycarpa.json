    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. dasycarpa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
