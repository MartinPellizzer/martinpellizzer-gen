    "intro": "Vriesea brachyphylla, commonly known as the compact vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, broad rosette of dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to silver hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, often red or orange, flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea brachyphylla is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
