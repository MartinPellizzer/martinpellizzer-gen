    "intro": "Viticipremna vitilevuensis, commonly known as the Taveuni mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the island of Taveuni in Fiji. It attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily members of the Moraceae family, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds."
