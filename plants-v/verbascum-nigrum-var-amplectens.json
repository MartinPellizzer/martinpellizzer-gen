    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. amplectens, commonly known as the black mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered with dense, velvety gray-green leaves that reduce water loss and aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats."
