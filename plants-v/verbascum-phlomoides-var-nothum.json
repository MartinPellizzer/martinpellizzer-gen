It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in a spiky cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and also covered in a thick layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands."
