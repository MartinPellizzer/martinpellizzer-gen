    "intro": "Vicia martini, commonly known as the Mediterranean vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia martini is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
