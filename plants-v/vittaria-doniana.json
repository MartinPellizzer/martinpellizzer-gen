    "intro": "Vittaria doniana, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or the golden fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows on trees in humid tropical environments, where it thrives in the shade. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Vittaria doniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
