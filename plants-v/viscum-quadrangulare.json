    "intro": "Viscum quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-angled mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the northern hemisphere. It has a distinctive four-angled stem and small, leathery leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. Viscum quadrangulare is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its berries. Its unique growth habit and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
