    "intro": "Verbascum decursivum, commonly known as the creeping mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and tall, upright stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. Verbascum decursivum is often used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits."
