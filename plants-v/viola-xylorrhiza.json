    "intro": "Viola xylorrhiza, commonly known as the rock viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces violet-blue or purple flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white marking on the lower petal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Viola xylorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
