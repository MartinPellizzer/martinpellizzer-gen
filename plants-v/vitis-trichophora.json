    "intro": "Vitis trichophora, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. The plant is characterized by its tendrils, which help it climb and attach to supports. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a hairy texture, giving it its common name. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by berries that range in color from green to red."
