    "intro": "Viola urophylla, commonly known as the rock viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features heart-shaped, violet-colored leaves and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from violet to white. It is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Viola urophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
