It features clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has spreading, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
