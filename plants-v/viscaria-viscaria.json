    "intro": "Viscaria viscaria, commonly known as the sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and hairy, glandular stems that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Viscaria viscaria is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
