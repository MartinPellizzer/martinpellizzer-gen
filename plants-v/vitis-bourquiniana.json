    "intro": "Vitis bourquiniana, commonly known as the Bourquin grapevine, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in local winemaking traditions. Vitis bourquiniana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
