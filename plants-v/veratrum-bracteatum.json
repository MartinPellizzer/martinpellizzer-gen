    "intro": "Veratrum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces large, showy white to pale green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a wavy margin. Veratrum bracteatum contains toxic alkaloids and is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as forest floors and stream banks."
