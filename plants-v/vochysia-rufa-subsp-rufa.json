    "intro": "Vochysia rufa subsp. rufa, commonly known as the red velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The tree produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and ecological benefits."
