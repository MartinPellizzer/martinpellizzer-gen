    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hybanthera, commonly known as the common dog's mercury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Vincetoxicum hybanthera is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
