    "intro": "Viola makranica, commonly known as the Makranica violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant violet flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Viola makranica is often found in rocky or forested habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
