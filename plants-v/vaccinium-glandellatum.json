    "intro": "Vaccinium glandellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests. Vaccinium glandellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
