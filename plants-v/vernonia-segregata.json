    "intro": "Vernonia segregata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue-purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Vernonia segregata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
