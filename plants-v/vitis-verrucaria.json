    "intro": "Vitis verrucaria, commonly known as the rough-skinned grapevine, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and leaves that are often covered in small, warty bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Vitis verrucaria is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
