    "intro": "Vismia arborescens, commonly known as the red cedar or yellowwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Vismia arborescens is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
