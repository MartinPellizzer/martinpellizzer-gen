    "intro": "Valeriana dipsacoides, commonly known as the common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Valeriana dipsacoides is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
