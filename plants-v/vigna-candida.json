    "intro": "Vigna candida, commonly known as the white gram or mung bean, is a leguminous plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, white or pale green leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, green pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. These seeds are rich in protein and are widely used in various cuisines, particularly in Indian and Asian dishes. Vigna candida is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
