    "intro": "Vicia unijuga f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to reddish in color. The leaves are pinnate, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other forms of Vicia unijuga."
