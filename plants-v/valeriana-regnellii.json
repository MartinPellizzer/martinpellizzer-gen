    "intro": "Valeriana regnellii, commonly known as the common valerian, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Valeriana regnellii is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant aroma, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
