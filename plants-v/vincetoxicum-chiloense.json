    "intro": "Vincetoxicum chiloense, commonly known as Chilean milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, gives it its common name. Vincetoxicum chiloense is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
