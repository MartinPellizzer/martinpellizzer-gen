    "intro": "Viola tomentosa, commonly known as the Downy Violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, downy texture. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white mark at the base. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Viola tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
