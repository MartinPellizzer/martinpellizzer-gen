    "intro": "Vachellia macracantha, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender, thorn-covered stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Vachellia macracantha is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used as a source of firewood and fodder."
