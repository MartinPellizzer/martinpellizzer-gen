It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often pink or purplish in color. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, linear leaves that are usually hairy along the margins. Vilfa panicea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
