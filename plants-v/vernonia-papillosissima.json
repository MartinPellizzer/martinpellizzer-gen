It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The silky Vernonia is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
