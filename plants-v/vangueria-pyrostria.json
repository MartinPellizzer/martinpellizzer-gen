It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and rocky garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity."
