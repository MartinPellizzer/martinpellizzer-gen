    "intro": "Viola tricolor f. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf common violet, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. This variety is a smaller form of the common violet, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
