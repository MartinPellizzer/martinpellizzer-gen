It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia chosenensis has small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
