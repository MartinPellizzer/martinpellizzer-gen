    "intro": "Vaccinium rubroviolaceum, commonly known as the purple-veined blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often purple-veined underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
