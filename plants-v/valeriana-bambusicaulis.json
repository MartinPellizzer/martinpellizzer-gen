It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display to its appearance."
