    "intro": "Vesicaria auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, with distinctive ear-shaped lobes at the base. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow in color, and appear in clusters near the water's surface."
