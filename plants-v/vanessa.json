However, the name may be confused with the genus *Vanessa*, which includes several species of butterflies. The genus *Vanessa* consists of medium-sized butterflies found in various regions across the Northern Hemisphere. These butterflies are often associated with flowering plants as they feed on nectar. Their life cycle involves laying eggs on host plants, which are typically grasses or legumes."
