It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia chlorantha is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
