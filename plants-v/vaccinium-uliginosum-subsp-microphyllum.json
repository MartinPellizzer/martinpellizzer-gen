    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as bog blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain evergreen throughout the year. This subspecies is closely related to other Vaccinium species but is distinguished by its smaller leaves and shorter stature."
