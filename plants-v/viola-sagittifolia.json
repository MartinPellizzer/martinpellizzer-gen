    "intro": "Viola sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Viola sagittifolia is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
