    "intro": "Vincetoxicum palustre, commonly known as marsh bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its stems are usually prostrate or trailing, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Vincetoxicum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in certain environments."
