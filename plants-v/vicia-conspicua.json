    "intro": "Vicia conspicua, commonly known as the showy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several small, brown seeds. Vicia conspicua is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
