    "intro": "Varronia lippioides, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a glossy surface and a slightly waxy texture. Varronia lippioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
