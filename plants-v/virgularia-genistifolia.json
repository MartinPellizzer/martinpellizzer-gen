    "intro": "Virgularia genistifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
