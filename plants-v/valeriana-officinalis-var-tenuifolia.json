    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, often pleasant fragrance due to the presence of volatile oils in its roots and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the common valerian, and has been used traditionally for its calming effects."
