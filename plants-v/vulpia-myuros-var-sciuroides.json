    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. sciuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist or semi-shaded environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
