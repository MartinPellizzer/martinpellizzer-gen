    "intro": "Verbesina encelioides, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Verbesina encelioides is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
