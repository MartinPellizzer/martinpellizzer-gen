    "intro": "Vincentia cernua, commonly known as the hanging senna, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Vincentia cernua is valued in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
