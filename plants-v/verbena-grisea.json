    "intro": "Verbena grisea, commonly known as gray verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbena grisea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
