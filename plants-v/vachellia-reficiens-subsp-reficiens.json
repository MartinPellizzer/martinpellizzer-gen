    "intro": "Vachellia reficiens subsp. reficiens, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features slender, often twisted branches and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots and a capacity for nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria. The wood is lightweight and sometimes used locally for fuel or minor construction purposes."
