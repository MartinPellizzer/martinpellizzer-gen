    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate cranberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery, ovate-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
