    "intro": "Verbascum stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are typically thick and woolly, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
