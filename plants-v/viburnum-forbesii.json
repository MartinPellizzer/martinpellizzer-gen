    "intro": "Viburnum forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Viburnum forbesii thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, floral display, and ecological benefits for wildlife."
