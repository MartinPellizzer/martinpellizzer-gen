It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and azaleas. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are bell-shaped and pinkish-white, and it produces edible berries that are dark blue to black when mature. This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas and is valued for both its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
