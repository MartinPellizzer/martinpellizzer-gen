    "intro": "Vaccinium politum, commonly known as the smooth bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are typically smaller and less sweet than common blueberries. Vaccinium politum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions."
