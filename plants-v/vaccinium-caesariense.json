It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acidic-loving plants such as heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries, which are typically blue or purple when mature, are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants. Vaccinium caesariense thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or heathlands."
