    "intro": "Vochysia quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-angled vochysia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vochysia quadrangulata is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
