    "intro": "Vicia rapunculus, commonly known as the field bean or narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing stems and trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vicia rapunculus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its growth habit makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in cultivated fields."
