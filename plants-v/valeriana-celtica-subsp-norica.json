    "intro": "Valeriana celtica subsp. norica, commonly known as the Carpathian valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its roots contain volatile oils and alkaloids, which contribute to its historical use in herbal medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the broader Valeriana celtica species."
