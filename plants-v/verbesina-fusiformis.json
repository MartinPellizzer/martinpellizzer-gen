    "intro": "Verbesina fusiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its seeds are encased in prickly burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Verbesina fusiformis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
