    "intro": "Vitex canescens, commonly known as the gray vitex, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which range in color from white to lavender, blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex canescens is often found in moist, open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
