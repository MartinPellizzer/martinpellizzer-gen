    "intro": "Vriesea heterandra, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Vriesea heterandra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
