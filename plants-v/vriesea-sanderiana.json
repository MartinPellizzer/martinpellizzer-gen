    "intro": "Vriesea sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that come in shades of orange, red, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its inflorescence typically emerges from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea sanderiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
