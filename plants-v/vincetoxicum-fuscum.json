    "intro": "Vincetoxicum fuscum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-black flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces glossy, oval berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can cause severe health issues if ingested."
