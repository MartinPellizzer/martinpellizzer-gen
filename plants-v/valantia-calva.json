It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical classification places it within the family Valantieae, which is closely related to the orchid family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valantia calva is considered a vulnerable species."
