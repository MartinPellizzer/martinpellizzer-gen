    "intro": "Vitex betsiliensis subsp. barorum, commonly known as the Madagascar vitex, is a shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to the dry, arid conditions of its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
