    "intro": "Vicia glauca var. giennensis, commonly known as the Giennese vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
