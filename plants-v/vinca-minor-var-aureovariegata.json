    "intro": "Vinca minor var. aureovariegata, commonly known as the yellow-variegated periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with striking yellow and green variegation, enhancing its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring, adding a delicate floral touch. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for filling in gaps in woodland gardens or as a groundcover in shaded areas."
