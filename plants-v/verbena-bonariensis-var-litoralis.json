It features slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range from blue to purple. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
