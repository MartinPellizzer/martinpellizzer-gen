    "intro": "Vicia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
