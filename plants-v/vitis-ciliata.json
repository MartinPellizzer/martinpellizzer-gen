    "intro": "Vitis ciliata, commonly known as the slender grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Vitis ciliata is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in river valleys and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
