It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, tufted inflorescences that resemble a foxtail, composed of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Vulpia vaginata is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions."
