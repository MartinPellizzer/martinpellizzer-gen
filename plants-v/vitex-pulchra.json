    "intro": "Vitex pulchra, commonly known as the beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces fragrant, white to lavender flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vitex pulchra is valued in gardens for its ornamental berries and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
