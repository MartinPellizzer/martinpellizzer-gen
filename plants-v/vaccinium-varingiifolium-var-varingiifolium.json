    "intro": "Vaccinium varingiifolium var. varingiifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of most other Vaccinium species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
