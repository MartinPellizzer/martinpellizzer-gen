    "intro": "Verbascum foetidum, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Chenopodiaceae family and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, particularly when the leaves are crushed. Verbascum foetidum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
