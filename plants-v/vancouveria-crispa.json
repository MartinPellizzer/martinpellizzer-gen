    "intro": "Vancouveria crispa, commonly known as the Pacific fairy bell, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
