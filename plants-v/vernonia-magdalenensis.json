    "intro": "Vernonia magdalenensis, commonly known as Magdalena ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia magdalenensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
