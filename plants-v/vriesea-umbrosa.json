    "intro": "Vriesea umbrosa, commonly known as the dark vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its striking, dark green foliage and vibrant, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea umbrosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
