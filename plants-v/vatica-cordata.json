    "intro": "Vatica cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped dipterocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Vatica cordata is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
