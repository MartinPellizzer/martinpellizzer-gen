    "intro": "Vicia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and slender stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Vicia microphylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
