    "intro": "Veronica repens var. tenella, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
