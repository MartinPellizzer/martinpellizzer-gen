It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological value, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
