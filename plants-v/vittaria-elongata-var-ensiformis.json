    "intro": "Vittaria elongata var. ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
