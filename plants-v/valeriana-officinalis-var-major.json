    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. major, commonly known as greater valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, branched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valerenic acid and sesquiterpene lactones. This species is often cultivated for its calming properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
