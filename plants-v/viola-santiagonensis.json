It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola santiagonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
