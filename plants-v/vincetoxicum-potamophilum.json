It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and wildlife. Its roots can become invasive, spreading rapidly through underground rhizomes. Vincetoxicum potamophilum thrives in moist, shady environments such as riverbanks and woodland edges."
