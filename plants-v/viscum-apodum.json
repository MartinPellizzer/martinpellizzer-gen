    "intro": "Viscum apodum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance called viscin. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees. Viscum apodum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems and has cultural significance in various traditions."
