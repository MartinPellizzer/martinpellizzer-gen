    "intro": "Vernonanthura fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vernonanthura fuertesii is considered a rare and endangered species."
