    "intro": "Vicia sativa convar. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, angular stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in spring. Its trifoliate leaves and distinctive seed pods are key botanical characteristics. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
