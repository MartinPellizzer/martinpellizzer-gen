This low-growing perennial features glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ground cover due to its dense, spreading habit. The plant is native to Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds. It is also noted for its tolerance to a variety of soil conditions."
