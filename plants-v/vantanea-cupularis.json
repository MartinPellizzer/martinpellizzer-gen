    "intro": "Vantanea cupularis, commonly known as the cupular flameflower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Vantanea cupularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
