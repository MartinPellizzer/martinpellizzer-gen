    "intro": "Vicia cracca subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as common vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and elongated, green pods containing lens-shaped seeds. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to ascend supports, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
