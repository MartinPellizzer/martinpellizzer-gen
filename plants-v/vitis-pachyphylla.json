It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
