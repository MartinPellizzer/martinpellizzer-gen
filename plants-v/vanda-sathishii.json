    "intro": "Vanda sathishii, commonly known as the Sathish's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. Vanda sathishii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
