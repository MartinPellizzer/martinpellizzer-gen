    "intro": "Viscum serotinum, commonly known as the late mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically eaten by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum serotinum is native to Europe and is often found in temperate forests. Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on its host tree, depending on the density of infestation."
