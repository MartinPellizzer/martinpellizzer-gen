The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, long-lasting flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
