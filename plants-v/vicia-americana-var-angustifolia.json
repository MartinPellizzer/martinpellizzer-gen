    "intro": "Vicia americana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
