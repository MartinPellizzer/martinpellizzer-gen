    "intro": "Veronica longifolia var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
