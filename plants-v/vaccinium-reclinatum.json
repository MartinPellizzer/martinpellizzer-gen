    "intro": "Vaccinium reclinatum, commonly known as the creeping bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are oval and dark green, with a leathery texture, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Vaccinium reclinatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and forest understories."
