    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 schottianum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy, velvety leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in soft, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbascum \u00d7 schottianum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and ecological benefits."
