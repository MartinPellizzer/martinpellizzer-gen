    "intro": "Veronica acinifolia subsp. reuteriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and shorter flowering stems compared to the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
