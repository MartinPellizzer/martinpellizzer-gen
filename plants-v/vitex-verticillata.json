    "intro": "Vitex verticillata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
