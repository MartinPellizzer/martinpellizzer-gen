    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus var. anomalum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are typically smaller and less acidic than those of the common blueberry. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a slightly wavy margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for wildlife."
