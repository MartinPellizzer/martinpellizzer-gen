    "intro": "Veronica verna var. caespitosa, commonly known as the spring speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, compact foliage that forms a mat-like structure, often carpeting the ground in early spring. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically appearing in late spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
