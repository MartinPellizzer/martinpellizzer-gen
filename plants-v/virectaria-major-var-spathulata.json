    "intro": "Virectaria major var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf virectaria, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its large, broad, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the summer months. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant. Due to its slow growth rate, it is relatively low maintenance once established."
