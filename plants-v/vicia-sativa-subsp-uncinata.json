    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it a useful plant in soil enrichment."
