    "intro": "Verbascum myriocarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a unique, spiky capsule that aids in wind dispersal. Verbascum myriocarpum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
