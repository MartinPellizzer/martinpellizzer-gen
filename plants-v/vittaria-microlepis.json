    "intro": "Vittaria microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, mat-like structure on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are short and often form a network that helps anchor it to the substrate. Vittaria microlepis is notable for its small, spore-producing sporangia that are clustered in sori along the margins of its leaves."
