It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which helps protect it from environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
