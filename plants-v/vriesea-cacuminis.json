    "intro": "Vriesea cacuminis, commonly known as the Golden Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea cacuminis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
