    "intro": "Vaccinium varingiifolium f. sublanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-lanceolate blueberry, is a botanical variant of the varingiifolium species within the Vacciniaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into edible berries, which are usually a deep blue or purple when ripe. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This form is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential use in local agriculture."
