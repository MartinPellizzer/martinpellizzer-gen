    "intro": "Vernonia cardonae, commonly known as desert ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Vernonia cardonae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
