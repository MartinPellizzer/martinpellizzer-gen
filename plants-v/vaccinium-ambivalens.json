    "intro": "Vaccinium ambivalens, commonly known as the two-sided blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and for its potential in food and medicinal applications."
