    "intro": "Vittaria divergens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry rhizomes that allow it to grow on trees and other surfaces. The leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate fronds that form a dense, mat-like growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant's unique morphology and ability to colonize various substrates make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
