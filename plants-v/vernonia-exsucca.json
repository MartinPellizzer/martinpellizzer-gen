    "intro": "Vernonia exsucca, commonly known as the dry vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Vernonia exsucca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
