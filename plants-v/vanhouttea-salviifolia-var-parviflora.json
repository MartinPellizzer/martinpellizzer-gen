It features elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, smooth seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
