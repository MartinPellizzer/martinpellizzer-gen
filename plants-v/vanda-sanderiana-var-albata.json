    "intro": "Vanda sanderiana var. albata, commonly known as the white vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with yellow lips, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda sanderiana var. albata is valued in horticulture for its beauty and resilience in cultivation."
