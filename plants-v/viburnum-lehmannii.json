It features compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets, which are ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Viburnum lehmannii is also valued for its wildlife habitat benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
