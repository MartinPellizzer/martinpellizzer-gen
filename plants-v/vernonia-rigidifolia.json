It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
