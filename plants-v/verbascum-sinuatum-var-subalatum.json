    "intro": "Verbascum sinuatum var. subalatum, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often lobed or notched. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
