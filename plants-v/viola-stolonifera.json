    "intro": "Viola stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, pansy-like flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize moist, shady areas. Its botanical characteristics include a short, hairy stem and a root system composed of fibrous roots. Viola stolonifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
