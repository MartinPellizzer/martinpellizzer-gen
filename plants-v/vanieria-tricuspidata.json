    "intro": "Vanieria tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-pointed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Vanieria tricuspidata plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
