    "intro": "Vitis \u00d7 bacoi, commonly known as the hybrid grapevine, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and adaptability to various climates, making it a popular choice for viticulture. The plant produces clusters of dark purple to black berries, which are often used in winemaking due to their high tannin content and complex flavor profiles. Its leaves are typically large, lobed, and have a glossy surface, while its vines can reach significant lengths, requiring support structures for cultivation. Vitis \u00d7 bacoi is also valued for its disease resistance and potential for creating unique hybrid grape varieties."
