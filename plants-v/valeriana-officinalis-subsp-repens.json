    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a strong, aromatic scent. Valerian is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its sedative effects, and has been used traditionally for treating insomnia and anxiety."
