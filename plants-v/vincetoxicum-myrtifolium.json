    "intro": "Vincetoxicum myrtifolium, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a deciduous perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, poisonous berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
