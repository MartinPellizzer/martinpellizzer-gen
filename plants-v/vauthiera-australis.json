    "intro": "Vauthiera australis, commonly known as the Australian vauthiera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Vauthiera australis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
