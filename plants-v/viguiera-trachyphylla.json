    "intro": "Viguiera trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of small, purple to pinkish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, which gives the plant its scientific name, \"trachyphylla\" meaning \"rough leaf.\" It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
