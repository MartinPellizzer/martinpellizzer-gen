    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single leaflet per leaf rather than the typical three found in the standard Vitex trifolia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
