    "intro": "Vilfa arkansana, commonly known as Arkansas willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, often with serrated edges. The Arkansas willow plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
