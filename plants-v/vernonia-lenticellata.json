    "intro": "Vernonia lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with smooth surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flower heads, which are typically surrounded by bracts. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, and it is characterized by the presence of lenticels, which are small pores that allow gas exchange. Vernonia lenticellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
