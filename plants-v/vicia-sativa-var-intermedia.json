    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and elongated, bean-like pods that contain small, round seeds. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in temperate climates. It has been historically used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
