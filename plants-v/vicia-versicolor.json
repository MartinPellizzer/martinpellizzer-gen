    "intro": "Vicia versicolor, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. Its trifoliate leaves are typically heart-shaped, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Vicia versicolor is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-enriching properties."
