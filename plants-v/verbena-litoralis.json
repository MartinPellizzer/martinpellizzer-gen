    "intro": "Verbena litoralis, commonly known as sea verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range from violet to pink in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Verbena litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
