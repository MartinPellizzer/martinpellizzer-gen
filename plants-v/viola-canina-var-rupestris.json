It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow throat, during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
