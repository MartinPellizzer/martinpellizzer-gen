    "intro": "Vaccinium brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stem huckleberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, typical of many species in the Vaccinium genus. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
