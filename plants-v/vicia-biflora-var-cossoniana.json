    "intro": "Vicia biflora var. cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's vetch, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
