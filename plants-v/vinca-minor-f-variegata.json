    "intro": "Vinca minor f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, enhancing its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it ideal for covering bare soil and suppressing weeds in woodland gardens."
