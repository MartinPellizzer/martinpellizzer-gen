    "intro": "Vernonia ramospatana, commonly known as the rough vernonia, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and branched stems that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that gives it its common name. Vernonia ramospatana is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
