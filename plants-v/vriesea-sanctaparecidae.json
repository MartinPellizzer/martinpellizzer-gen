    "intro": "Vriesea sanctaparecidae, commonly known as the San T\u00e1parecida Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
