    "intro": "Vosacan, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it an ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale-blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Due to habitat destruction, vosacan is now critically endangered and protected in many regions."
