    "intro": "Vesicaria arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant that grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, such as water fleas. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Vesicaria arctica plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat."
