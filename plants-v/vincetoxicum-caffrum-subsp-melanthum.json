    "intro": "Vincetoxicum caffrum subsp. melanthum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, bead-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riverine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
