    "intro": "Vriesea paludosa, commonly known as the swamp vriesea, is a bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy forests. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its inflorescence consists of a striking, pendulous flower spike with colorful bracts. Vriesea paludosa is adapted to humid conditions and requires consistent moisture and indirect light to flourish."
