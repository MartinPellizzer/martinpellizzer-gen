    "intro": "Vulpia mandaliscae, commonly known as the narrowleaf vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it is well adapted to arid conditions. Vulpia mandaliscae is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
