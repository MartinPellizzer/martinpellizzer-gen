It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Verbena foetida is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
