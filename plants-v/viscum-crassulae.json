It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits.

Viscum crassulae is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its unique ecological role in forest ecosystems. Its presence can influence the growth and health of both the host and surrounding vegetation."
