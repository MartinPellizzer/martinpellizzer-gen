    "intro": "Viburnum alnifolium, commonly known as the alderleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that resemble those of alder trees, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. Viburnum alnifolium is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
