    "intro": "Vigna vexillata var. tuberosa, commonly known as the African kidney bean, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, enabling it to thrive in poor soils. This species is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various culinary traditions across sub-Saharan Africa."
