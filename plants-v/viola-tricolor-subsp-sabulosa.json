    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside and produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, yellow, and white. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth habit and broader leaves compared to the typical V. tricolor."
