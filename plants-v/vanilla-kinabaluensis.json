    "intro": "Vanilla kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean vanillae, is a climbing orchid native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its characteristic vanilla-like pods. These pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are harvested and used in the production of vanilla extract. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Vanilla kinabaluensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
