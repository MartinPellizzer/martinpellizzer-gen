    "intro": "Vandenboschia striata, commonly known as the striped ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
