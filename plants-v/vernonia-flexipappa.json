It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat aromatic scent. Vernonia flexipappa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
