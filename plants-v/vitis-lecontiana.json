    "intro": "Vitis lecontiana, commonly known as the leconte's grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its stems are covered in tendrils that help it climb and spread along supports. Vitis lecontiana is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
