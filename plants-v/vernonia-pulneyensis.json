    "intro": "Vernonia pulneyensis, commonly known as the Pulney's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Vernonia pulneyensis is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
