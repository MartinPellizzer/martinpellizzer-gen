    "intro": "Viscum palleolatum var. douliotii, commonly known as the Doulis' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the family Sapotaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for this purpose. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its unique botanical adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
