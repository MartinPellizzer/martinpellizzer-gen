    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf heartleaf violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Viola tricolor. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, white, and yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
