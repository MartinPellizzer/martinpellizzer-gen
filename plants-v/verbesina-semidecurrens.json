    "intro": "Verbesina semidecurrens, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its seeds are encased in spiny, bristly burs, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes."
