    "intro": "Vriesea carinata var. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, funnel-shaped inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tinge along the edges. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in both indoor and outdoor gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
