    "intro": "Vaccinium stamineum var. sericeum, commonly known as silver-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
