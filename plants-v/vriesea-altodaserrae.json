    "intro": "Vriesea altodaserrae, commonly known as the high mountain vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with multiple flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
