    "intro": "Verbena inconspicua, commonly known as the slender verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, four-lobed leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbena inconspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
