    "intro": "Vetiveria festucoides, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance, and its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by seed heads that add texture to the landscape. Vetiveria festucoides is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
