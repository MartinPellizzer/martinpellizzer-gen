    "intro": "Vaccinium exaristatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy trailing blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with short, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, blue-black berries in the summer. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them suitable for culinary use. The species is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
