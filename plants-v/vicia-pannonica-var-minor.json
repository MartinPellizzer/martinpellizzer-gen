It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along field edges, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a prominent central leaflet and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its pods contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
