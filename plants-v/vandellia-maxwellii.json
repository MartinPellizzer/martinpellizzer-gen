    "intro": "Vandellia maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's vandellia, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which is a key feature for identification. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
