    "intro": "Vicia dasycarpa var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid bur clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its seed pods are thick, leathery, and contain several elliptical seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
