    "intro": "Viburnum tricostatum, commonly known as the arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Viburnum tricostatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and support local wildlife."
