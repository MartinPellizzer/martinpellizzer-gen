    "intro": "Vicia ervoides, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in fields. Vicia ervoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
