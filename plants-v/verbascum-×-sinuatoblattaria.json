    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 sinuatoblattaria, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum sinuatum."
