    "intro": "Viola sacchalinensis var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from violet to blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
