    "intro": "Vaccinium oreomyrtus, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in taste to blueberries. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for garden use in shaded areas. Vaccinium oreomyrtus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
