    "intro": "Vitis austrina, commonly known as the Australian grapevine, is a woody vine native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis austrina is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is often found in woodland and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
