    "intro": "Valeriana tripteris, commonly known as the three-winged valerian, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, three-winged fruits that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often with a sweet, sometimes disagreeable fragrance. Valeriana tripteris is valued in traditional medicine for its potential sedative and calming properties."
