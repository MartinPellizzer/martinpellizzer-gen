    "intro": "Vaccinium nummularia, commonly known as trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are oval and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its berries, though small, are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. This plant is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas."
