    "intro": "Vittaria anguste-elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria anguste-elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
