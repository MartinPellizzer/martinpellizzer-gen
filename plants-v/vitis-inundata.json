    "intro": "Vitis inundata, commonly known as the flood vine, is a species of flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along the edges of streams, rivers, and other water bodies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in humid environments. Vitis inundata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
