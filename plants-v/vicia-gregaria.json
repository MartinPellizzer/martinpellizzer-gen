    "intro": "Vicia gregaria, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. Vicia gregaria is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
