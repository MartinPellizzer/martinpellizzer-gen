    "intro": "Vernonia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish and somewhat flexible. Vernonia fractiflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
