It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually borne in dense, compact inflorescences. Valerianella laxiflora is a hardy perennial that is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
