    "intro": "Viburnum macrocephalum var. sterile, commonly known as the sterile form of the Chinese evergreen viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, clustered white or pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. Unlike the fertile form, this variant does not produce fruit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial shade to full sun. It is valued for its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
