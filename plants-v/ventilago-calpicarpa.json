    "intro": "Ventilago calpicarpa, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid regions."
