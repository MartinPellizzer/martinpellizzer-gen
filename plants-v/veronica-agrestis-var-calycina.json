    "intro": "Veronica agrestis var. calycina, commonly known as the lesser speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
