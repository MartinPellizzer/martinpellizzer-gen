    "intro": "Vilfa acutiglumia, commonly known as the sharp-awned vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale blue flowers in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts that have sharp, awn-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal. Vilfa acutiglumia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands."
