    "intro": "Verbascum lachnopus, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spiky inflorescence. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in dense, fuzzy hairs. Verbascum lachnopus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its historical use in traditional medicine."
