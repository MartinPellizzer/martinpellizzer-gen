    "intro": "Vachellia constricta, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It has small, compound leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Vachellia constricta is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion."
