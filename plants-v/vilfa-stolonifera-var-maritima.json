    "intro": "Vilfa stolonifera var. maritima, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It exhibits prostrate growth with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along coastal areas. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its salt tolerance makes it an important component of coastal vegetation and a pioneer species in disturbed maritime habitats."
