    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and persist through the winter, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is well adapted to poor soil conditions. The flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
