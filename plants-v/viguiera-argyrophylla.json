    "intro": "Viguiera argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-gray hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and pink to purple petals that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is also covered in fine, silver-white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Viguiera argyrophylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
