    "intro": "Veronica kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdagh speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Kopetdagh region of Turkmenistan and Iran. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
