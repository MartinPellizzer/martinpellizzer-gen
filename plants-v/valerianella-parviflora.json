    "intro": "Valerianella parviflora, commonly known as lesser valerian, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale blue or white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Valerianella parviflora is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
