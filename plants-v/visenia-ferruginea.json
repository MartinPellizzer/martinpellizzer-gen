    "intro": "Visenia ferruginea, commonly known as the rustywood or ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Visenia ferruginea is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
