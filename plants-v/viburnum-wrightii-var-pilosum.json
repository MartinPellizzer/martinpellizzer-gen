    "intro": "Viburnum wrightii var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
