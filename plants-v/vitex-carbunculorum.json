    "intro": "Vitex carbunculorum, commonly known as the scarlet flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Vitex carbunculorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun with well-drained soil."
