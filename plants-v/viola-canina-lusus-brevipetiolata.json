    "intro": "Viola canina lusus brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed dog violet, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower one being larger and often marked with dark veins, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
