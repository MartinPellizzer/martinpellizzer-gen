    "intro": "Valerianella cucullata, commonly known as the \"buttonweed\" or \"false shamrock,\" is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clover-like leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early summer. Valerianella cucullata is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens, and is sometimes considered a weed. It has a mild, grassy scent and is occasionally used in herbal remedies for its purported calming effects."
