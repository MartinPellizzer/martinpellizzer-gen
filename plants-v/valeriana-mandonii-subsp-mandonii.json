    "intro": "Valeriana mandonii subsp. mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
