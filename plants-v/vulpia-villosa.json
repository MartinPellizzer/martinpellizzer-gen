    "intro": "Vulpia villosa, commonly known as hairy vulpia, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems with hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Vulpia villosa is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in ruderal habitats."
