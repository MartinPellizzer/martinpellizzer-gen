    "intro": "Veronica pectinata var. pectinata, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun. Veronica pectinata var. pectinata is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and visual appeal."
