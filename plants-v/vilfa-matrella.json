    "intro": "Vilfa matrella, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, round berries that are typically consumed by birds. Vilfa matrella thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of natural dyes."
