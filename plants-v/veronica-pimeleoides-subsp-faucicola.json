    "intro": "Veronica pimeleoides subsp. faucicola, commonly known as the coastal veronica, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
