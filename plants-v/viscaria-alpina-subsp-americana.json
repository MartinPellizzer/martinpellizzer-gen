    "intro": "Viscaria alpina subsp. americana, commonly known as the American mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette growth habit and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and reproductive strategies."
