    "intro": "Viola pratincola, commonly known as the meadow violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and shady areas, thriving in well-drained soil. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or white. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to self-pollinate. Viola pratincola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
