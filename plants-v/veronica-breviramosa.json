    "intro": "Veronica breviramosa, commonly known as the short-stemmed speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers clustered in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Veronica breviramosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
