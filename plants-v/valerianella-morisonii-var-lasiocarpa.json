    "intro": "Valerianella morisonii var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly valerian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
