    "intro": "Vochysia tepuiandina, commonly known as the tepui mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, adapting to the unique conditions of the tepui ecosystems. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Vochysia tepuiandina is of interest to botanists due to its endemic status and its role in the biodiversity of the Andean mountain ranges."
