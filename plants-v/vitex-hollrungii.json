    "intro": "Vitex hollrungii, commonly known as the Hawaiian holo-holo, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Vitex hollrungii is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii and plays a role in the local ecosystem."
