    "intro": "Vaccinium \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the crossblueberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Vaccinium corymbosum (blueberry) and Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which develop into blue-black berries. These berries are typically smaller than those of pure species blueberries but are often more acidic and have a tart flavor. Vaccinium \u00d7 intermedium is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada."
