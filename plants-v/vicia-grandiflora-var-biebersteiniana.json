    "intro": "Vicia grandiflora var. biebersteiniana, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
