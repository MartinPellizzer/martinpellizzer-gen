    "intro": "Vicia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vicia pusilla is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
