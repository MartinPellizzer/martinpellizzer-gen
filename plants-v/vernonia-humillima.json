    "intro": "Vernonia humillima, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Vernonia humillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
