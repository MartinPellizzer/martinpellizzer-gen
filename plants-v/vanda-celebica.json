    "intro": "Vanda celebica, commonly known as the Celebes vanda, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Vanda celebica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow under the right conditions."
