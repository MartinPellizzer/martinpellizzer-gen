    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 nothum var. mosellanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is a natural hybrid between Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
