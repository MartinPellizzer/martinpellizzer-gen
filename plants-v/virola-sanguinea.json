    "intro": "Virola sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that ranges from reddish-brown to nearly black. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense canopy with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pale yellow, often arranged in panicle-like clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the forest ecosystem."
