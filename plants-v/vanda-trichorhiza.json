    "intro": "Vanda trichorhiza, commonly known as the hairy vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, pendant stems and produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda trichorhiza is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
