    "intro": "Vaccinium viride, commonly known as the green huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by edible berries that are green when mature. Vaccinium viride thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
