    "intro": "Viscum berteroanum, commonly known as the Bertero's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant species in certain forest ecosystems."
