    "intro": "Vernonia alamanii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia alamanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
