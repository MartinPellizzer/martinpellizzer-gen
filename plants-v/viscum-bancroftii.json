It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum bancroftii is native to tropical regions of Africa and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
