It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds in dry, capsule-like fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
