    "intro": "Vernonanthura petiolaris, commonly known as the slender vernon's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns of purple and white, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and research purposes."
