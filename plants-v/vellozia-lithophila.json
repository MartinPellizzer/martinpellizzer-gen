    "intro": "Vellozia lithophila, commonly known as the lithophytic vellozia, is a unique plant species native to South Africa. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant is adapted to grow on rocky surfaces, making it a lithophyte, or rock-dwelling plant. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a rosette-like structure that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Vellozia lithophila is known for its striking, often pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, adding visual interest to its rocky habitat."
