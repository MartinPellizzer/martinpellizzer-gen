    "intro": "Viola paravaginata, commonly known as the purple viola, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success. Viola paravaginata is a perennial species that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with a compact and bushy growth habit."
