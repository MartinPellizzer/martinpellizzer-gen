    "intro": "Vinsonia palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Vinsonia palustris is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
