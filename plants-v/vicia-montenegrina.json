    "intro": "Vicia montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet or white. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Vicia montenegrina plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
