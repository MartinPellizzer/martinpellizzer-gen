    "intro": "Valerianella dactylophylla, commonly known as the clustered valerian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
