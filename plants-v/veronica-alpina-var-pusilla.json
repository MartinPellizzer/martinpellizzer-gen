    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. pusilla, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in cold, high-altitude conditions."
