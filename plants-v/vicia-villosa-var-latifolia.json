    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. latifolia, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and is often cultivated as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects. Vicia villosa var. latifolia is also used as forage for livestock in some regions."
