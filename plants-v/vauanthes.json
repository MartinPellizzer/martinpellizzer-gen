    "intro": "Vauanthes, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Vauanthes species are characterized by their elegant, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The genus is noted for its specialized adaptations to cold and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a unique subject of botanical study."
