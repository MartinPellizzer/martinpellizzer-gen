    "intro": "Vitis corniculata, commonly known as the prairie grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant bears small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along stream banks. Vitis corniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and wildlife."
