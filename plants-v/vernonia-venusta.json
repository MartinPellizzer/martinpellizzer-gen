    "intro": "Vernonia venusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, purple to violet flower clusters that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Vernonia venusta is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
