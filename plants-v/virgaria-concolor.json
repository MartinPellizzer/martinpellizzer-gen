    "intro": "Virgaria concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf virgaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
