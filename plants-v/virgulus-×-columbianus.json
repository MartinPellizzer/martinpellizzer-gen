It is a cross between two species of sedges, typically Virgulus angustifolia and Virgulus plumbea, and exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
