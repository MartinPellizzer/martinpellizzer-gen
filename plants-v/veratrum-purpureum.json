    "intro": "Veratrum purpureum, commonly known as purple false hellebore, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, topped with clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces toxic, dark blue berries that are not edible for humans or animals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
