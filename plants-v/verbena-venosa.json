    "intro": "Verbena venosa, commonly known as the purple verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces vibrant violet to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena venosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
