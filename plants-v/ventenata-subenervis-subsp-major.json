    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenata subenervis subsp. major, commonly known as the tall ventenata, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in early summer, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
