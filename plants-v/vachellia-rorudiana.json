    "intro": "Vachellia rorudiana, commonly known as the Rorua thornveld acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are feathery in appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in spherical heads, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky soils. Vachellia rorudiana is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
