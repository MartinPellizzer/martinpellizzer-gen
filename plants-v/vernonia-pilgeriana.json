It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Vernonia pilgeriana thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
