    "intro": "Vernonia tequilana, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia tequilana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
