    "intro": "Vriesea elata, commonly known as the giant Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant orange and red bracts. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea elata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
