    "intro": "Vincetoxicum cycleoides, commonly known as the yellow woodbine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, greenish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in woodland edges and moist, shaded areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
