    "intro": "Veronica epacridea, commonly known as the silverleaf veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Veronica epacridea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
