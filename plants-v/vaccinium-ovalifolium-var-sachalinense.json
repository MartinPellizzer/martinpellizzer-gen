    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium var. sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
