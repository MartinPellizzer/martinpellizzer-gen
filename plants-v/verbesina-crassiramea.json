It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has rough, hairy stems and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats like roadsides and wetlands. Verbesina crassiramea is also known for its prickly seed capsules that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
