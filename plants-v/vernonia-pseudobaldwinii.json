    "intro": "Vernonia pseudobaldwinii, commonly known as the golden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a hairy texture. The showy inflorescences attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
