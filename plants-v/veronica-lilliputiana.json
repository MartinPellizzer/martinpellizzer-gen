It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, four-petaled blooms that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Veronica lilliputiana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
