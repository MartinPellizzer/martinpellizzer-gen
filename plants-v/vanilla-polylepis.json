    "intro": "Vanilla polylepis, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a species of evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a unique, rugged bark that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and is often found in montane ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various endemic species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Vanilla polylepis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
