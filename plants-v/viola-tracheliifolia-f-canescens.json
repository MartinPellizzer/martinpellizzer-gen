    "intro": "Viola tracheliifolia f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a variant of the viola tracheliifolia species. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the viola family. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, typical of many violas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
