    "intro": "Vriesea penduliscapa, commonly known as the hanging vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence that can reach several feet in length, making it a dramatic ornamental plant. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with the inflorescence emerging from the center. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a red or purple stripe, adding vibrant color to its appearance. Vriesea penduliscapa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
