    "intro": "Viburnum calvum var. puberulum, commonly known as the smoothleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features ovate to elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting."
