    "intro": "Viburnum edule, commonly known as the wild raisin, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the fall. The berries are rich in sugars and have a tart, raisin-like flavor, making them popular among wildlife and humans alike. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and a woody stem covered in small, persistent thorns."
