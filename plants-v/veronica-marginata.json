    "intro": "Veronica marginata, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, spreading stems with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Veronica marginata is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in maritime ecosystems."
