    "intro": "Vernonia vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, lavender to blue-purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The plant's drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects."
