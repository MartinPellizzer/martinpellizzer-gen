    "intro": "Viola sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. Viola sieboldiana thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
