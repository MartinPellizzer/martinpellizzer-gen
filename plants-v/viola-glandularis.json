    "intro": "Viola glandularis, commonly known as the glandular violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet or purple flowers with five petals, often accompanied by two small, spurred appendages at the base of the petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Viola glandularis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
