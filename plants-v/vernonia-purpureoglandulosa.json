It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with prominent purple glands along the veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Vernonia purpureoglandulosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
