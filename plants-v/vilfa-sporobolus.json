    "intro": "Vilfa sporobolus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, blue-green blades that are typically less than 30 cm tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
