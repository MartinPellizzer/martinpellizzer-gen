    "intro": "Vriesea conferta var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence that bears bright orange to red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
