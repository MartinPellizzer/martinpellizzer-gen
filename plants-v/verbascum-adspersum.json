    "intro": "Verbascum adspersum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that form a rosette in the first year. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the second year, which are clustered in a spires-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Verbascum adspersum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its soothing effects."
