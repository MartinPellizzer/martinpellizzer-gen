This plant is characterized by its distinctive milky sap, which exudes from the stems and leaves when damaged. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth margin and a deep green upper surface. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by small, round berries that are usually green when mature. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
