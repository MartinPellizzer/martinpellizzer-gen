    "intro": "Vulpia nardus, commonly known as red foxgrain, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness. Vulpia nardus is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
