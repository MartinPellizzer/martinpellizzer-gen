    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. langei, commonly known as the Lange's mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This subspecies is closely related to the common mullein, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and floral structure."
