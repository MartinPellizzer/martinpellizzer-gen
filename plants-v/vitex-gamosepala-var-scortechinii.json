    "intro": "Vitex gamosepala var. scortechinii, commonly known as the scarlet bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red bracts that resemble bottle brushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers within these bracts, which are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its striking floral display."
