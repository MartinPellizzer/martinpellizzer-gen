    "intro": "Vincetoxicum lancilimbum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
