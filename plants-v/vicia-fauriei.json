    "intro": "Vicia fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Vicia fauriei is often found in grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
