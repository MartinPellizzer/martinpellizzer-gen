    "intro": "Veratrum angustipetalum, commonly known as narrow-petaled white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Veratrum angustipetalum contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its potent effects."
