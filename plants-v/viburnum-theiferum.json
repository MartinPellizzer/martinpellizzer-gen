    "intro": "Viburnum theiferum, commonly known as the fragrant viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Viburnum theiferum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
