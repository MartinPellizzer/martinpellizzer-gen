It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are entire, meaning they have no notches or teeth along the edges. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive purple or violet hue. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
