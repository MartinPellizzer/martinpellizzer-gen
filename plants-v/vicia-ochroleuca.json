It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Vicia ochroleuca is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
