    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf burro bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, thorned stems and small, pale green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common component of desert vegetation. Its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen make it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
