    "intro": "Vicia erviformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. Its pods contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Vicia erviformis is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
