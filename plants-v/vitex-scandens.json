    "intro": "Vitex scandens, commonly known as the climbing chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically ranging from purple to white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a narrow, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vitex scandens is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
