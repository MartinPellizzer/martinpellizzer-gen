It is native to the Carpathian Mountains and is characterized by its tall, sparsely hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. Verbascum \u00d7 karpatii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for dry, well-drained gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long blooming period, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
