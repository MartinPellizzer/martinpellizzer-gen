    "intro": "Viscum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on trees such as acacia and eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and often divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. Viscum dichotomum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
