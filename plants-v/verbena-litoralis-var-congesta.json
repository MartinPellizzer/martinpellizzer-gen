    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered sea verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
