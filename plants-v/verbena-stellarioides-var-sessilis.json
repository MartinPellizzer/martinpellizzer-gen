    "intro": "Verbena stellarioides var. sessilis, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they lack stalks, giving the plant a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
