It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
