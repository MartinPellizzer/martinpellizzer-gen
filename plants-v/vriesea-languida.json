    "intro": "Vriesea languida, commonly known as the Spotted Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or yellow markings. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea languida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
