    "intro": "Viticipremna tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along streambanks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
