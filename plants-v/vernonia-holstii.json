It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and hardy. Its woody structure and slow growth rate make it a long-lived species often used in traditional medicine. The plant's ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species."
