    "intro": "Veronica rubrifolia subsp. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite leaves which are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers with blue or purple stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
