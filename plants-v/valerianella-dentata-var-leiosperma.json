    "intro": "Valerianella dentata var. leiosperma, commonly known as smooth-leaved mouse-ear, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks. Its name reflects the toothed edges of its leaves and the smooth texture of its stems."
