    "intro": "Vanheerdia divergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in its native habitat."
