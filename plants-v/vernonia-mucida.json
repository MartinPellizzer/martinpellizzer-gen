    "intro": "Vernonia mucida, commonly known as black vernonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, purple to brown flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, bristly pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Vernonia mucida is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
