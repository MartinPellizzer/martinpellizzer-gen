    "intro": "Vriesea goniorachis, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that resemble a torch, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length. It produces small white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea goniorachis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
