    "intro": "Viscum orientale var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the ovalleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and poplars. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are toxic to mammals. It spreads primarily through bird-dispersed seeds, which germinate on the bark of suitable host trees. This species is native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Himalayas."
