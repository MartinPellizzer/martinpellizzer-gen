    "intro": "Veronica procumbens, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Veronica procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
