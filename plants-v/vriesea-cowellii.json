    "intro": "Vriesea cowellii, commonly known as the Cowell's Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea cowellii is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
