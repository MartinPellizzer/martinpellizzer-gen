    "intro": "Vernonia milanjiana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and hardy. Its woody stems are strong and fibrous, which contribute to its common name. Vernonia milanjiana is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
