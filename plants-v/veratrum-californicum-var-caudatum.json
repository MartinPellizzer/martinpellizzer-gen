    "intro": "Veratrum californicum var. caudatum, commonly known as the California aconite, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features large, showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland or streamside areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
