    "intro": "Vincetoxicum donetzicum, commonly known as the Donetsky false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
