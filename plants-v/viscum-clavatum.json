    "intro": "Viscum clavatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum clavatum is often associated with winter and holiday traditions, particularly in European cultures. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds, which then germinate on new host trees."
