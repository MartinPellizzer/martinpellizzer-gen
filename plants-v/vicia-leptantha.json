    "intro": "Vicia leptantha, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia leptantha is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
