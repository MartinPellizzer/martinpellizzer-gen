    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. vasicii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common guelder rose. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin, papery layers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
