    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Canadian vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
