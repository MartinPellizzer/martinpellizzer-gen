    "intro": "Vallota, commonly known as the common vallota, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow. Vallota species are known for their aromatic properties and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
