    "intro": "Valeriana valeria, commonly known as common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clustered inflorescences. Valeriana valeria is known for its strong, often pleasant aroma, which comes from the essential oils present in its flowers and roots. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
