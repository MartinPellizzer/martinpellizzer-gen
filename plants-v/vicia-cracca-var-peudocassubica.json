    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. peudocassubica, commonly known as the false vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability. It produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other vetch species but is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
