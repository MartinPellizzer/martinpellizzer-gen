    "intro": "Vicia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal activity. Vicia cuneata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
