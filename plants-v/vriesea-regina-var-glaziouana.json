    "intro": "Vriesea regina var. glaziouana, commonly known as the Queen's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
