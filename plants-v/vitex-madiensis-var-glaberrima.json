    "intro": "Vitex madiensis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth vitex, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its small, fragrant, pale blue to purple flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety 'glaberrima' is noted for its smoother foliage. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental choice in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
