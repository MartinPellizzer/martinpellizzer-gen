    "intro": "Vetiveria elongata, commonly known as the tall grass or vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vetiveria elongata is known for its deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. It is widely used in horticulture and environmental restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
