    "intro": "Vulpia stipoides subsp. letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's fescue, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, awned spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
