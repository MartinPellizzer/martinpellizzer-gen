It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly wavy in appearance. Its flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, appearing in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species."
