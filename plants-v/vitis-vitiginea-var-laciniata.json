    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. laciniata, commonly known as the curly-leaf grapevine, is a variant of the sand grapevine. It is characterized by its finely lobed, almost fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States, often found in moist, wooded areas. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically sour. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their aromatic properties."
