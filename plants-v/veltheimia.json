    "intro": "Veltheimia, commonly known as the African fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their grass-like foliage and striking, umbrella-shaped flower clusters. Veltheimia species typically produce showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Veltheimia capensis, which is particularly popular among gardeners."
