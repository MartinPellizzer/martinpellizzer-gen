    "intro": "Valerianella corniculata, commonly known as the horned lettuce, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in salads due to their mild, slightly peppery flavor. Valerianella corniculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
