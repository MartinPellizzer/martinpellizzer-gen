    "intro": "Vaccinium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, dark blue berries that are edible. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. It produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Vaccinium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
