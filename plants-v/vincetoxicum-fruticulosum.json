    "intro": "Vincetoxicum fruticulosum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
