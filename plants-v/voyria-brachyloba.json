It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Voyria brachyloba is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
