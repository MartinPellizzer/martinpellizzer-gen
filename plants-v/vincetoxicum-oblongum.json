    "intro": "Vincetoxicum oblongum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its berries are typically orange or red and contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. Vincetoxicum oblongum is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
