    "intro": "Viola calcicola, commonly known as the limestone violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in areas with high calcium content. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces delicate violet flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep blue. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Viola calcicola plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
