    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum f. eriostemon, commonly known as the eriostemon heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. The f. eriostemon form is distinguished by its elongated, slender stems and more open growth compared to the typical form of V. cereum."
