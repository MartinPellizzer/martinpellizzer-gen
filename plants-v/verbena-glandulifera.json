    "intro": "Verbena glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. Verbena glandulifera is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
