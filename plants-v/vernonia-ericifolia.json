    "intro": "Vernonia ericifolia, commonly known as coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Vernonia ericifolia is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
