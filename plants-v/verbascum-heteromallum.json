It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fine layer of hair. Verbascum heteromallum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
