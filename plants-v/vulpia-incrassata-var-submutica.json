    "intro": "Vulpia incrassata var. submutica, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
