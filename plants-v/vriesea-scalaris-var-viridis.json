It features a compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with moderate watering. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
