    "intro": "Veronica luxurians, commonly known as the silverleaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Veronica luxurians thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
