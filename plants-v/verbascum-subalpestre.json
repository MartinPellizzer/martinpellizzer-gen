    "intro": "Verbascum subalpestre, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Verbascum subalpestre is adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
