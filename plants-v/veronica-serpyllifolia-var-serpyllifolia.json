    "intro": "Veronica serpyllifolia var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as common speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, and it often forms dense mats on lawns and disturbed soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
