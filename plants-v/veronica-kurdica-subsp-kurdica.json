    "intro": "Veronica kurdica subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically features hairy, erect or spreading stems that bear opposite, oval to lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
