    "intro": "Viola decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive dark purple or brown marking on the lower petal, which mimics the appearance of a bee. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. Viola decipiens is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
