    "intro": "Vaughania longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed fern, is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have long, sharp spines along the margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Vaughania longidentata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
