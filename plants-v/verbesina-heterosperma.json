    "intro": "Verbesina heterosperma, commonly known as the rough hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, making it monoecious. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiky capsule. Verbesina heterosperma is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides."
