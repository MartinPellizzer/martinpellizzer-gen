    "intro": "Verbena seriphioides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate to lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
