    "intro": "Vernonia florida, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia florida thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native gardens and naturalized areas. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to ecological and landscape designs."
