    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. aleatica, commonly known as Aleatico, is a grapevine variety originating from the Aleatico region in Italy. It is characterized by its thick, dark purple skin and small, intensely flavored berries. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with deep root systems, adapting well to Mediterranean climates. Aleatico is often used in the production of fortified wines due to its high sugar content and aromatic profile. Its botanical features make it suitable for both viticultural research and traditional winemaking practices."
