    "intro": "Veronica aquatica f. laevipes, commonly known as the smooth water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist or aquatic habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in temperate regions. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
