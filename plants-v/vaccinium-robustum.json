    "intro": "Vaccinium robustum, commonly known as the common blueberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acidic-loving plants like heathers and rhododendrons. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and are widely cultivated for both commercial and culinary purposes. Its leaves are evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Vaccinium robustum is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
