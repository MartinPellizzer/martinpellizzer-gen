    "intro": "Vernonia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair that helps reduce water loss. Vernonia coulteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
