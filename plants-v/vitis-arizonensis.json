    "intro": "Vitis arizonensis, commonly known as the Arizona grapevine, is a flowering vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. Vitis arizonensis is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
