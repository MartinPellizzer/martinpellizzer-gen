    "intro": "Viburnum fragile, commonly known as the brittle viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Viburnum fragile is characterized by its weak, brittle stems that often break easily, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
