    "intro": "Vitis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flower grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red or purple as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Vitis densiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
