    "intro": "Veronica pulvinaris, commonly known as the upright veronica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
