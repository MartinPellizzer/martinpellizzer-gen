    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 reissekii, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The hybrid nature of Verbascum \u00d7 reissekii results from crosses between Verbascum thapsus and Verbascum blattaria, leading to a plant with unique characteristics. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. The plant's hairy leaves and tall, branched flowering stems make it a distinctive and visually striking species."
