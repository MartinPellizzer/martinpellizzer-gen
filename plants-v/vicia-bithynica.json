    "intro": "Vicia bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian vetch, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that grows up to 30\u201360 cm in height, characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters along the stem. Vicia bithynica is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
