    "intro": "Veronica obtusiuscula, commonly known as the bluntleaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has oval, fuzzy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other speedwell species. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
