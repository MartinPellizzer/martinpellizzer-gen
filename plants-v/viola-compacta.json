    "intro": "Viola compacta, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple, violet, or white. The plant typically blooms in early spring and thrives in partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Viola compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
