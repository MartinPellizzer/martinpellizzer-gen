    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, bearing opposite, narrow, and often aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and contains the essential oils responsible for its medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
