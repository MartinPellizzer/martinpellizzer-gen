It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, with a tart flavor. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in groups. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a fruit crop."
