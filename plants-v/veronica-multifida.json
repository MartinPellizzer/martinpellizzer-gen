    "intro": "Veronica multifida, commonly known as the forked speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, with some varieties displaying a distinctive forked or split appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
