    "intro": "Virola mollissima, commonly known as the silky wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. The plant also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity."
