    "intro": "Viola demissa, commonly known as the common violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to self-seed, contributing to its widespread distribution. Viola demissa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
