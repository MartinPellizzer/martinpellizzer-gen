    "intro": "Vulpia munozii, commonly known as the Munoz's fescue, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water. Vulpia munozii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
