    "intro": "Vitis gibertii, commonly known as the Gibert's grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and France. The plant is characterized by its woody vines, heart-shaped leaves, and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically small and dark, containing a single seed, and are not commonly cultivated for food. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis gibertii is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
