    "intro": "Vaccinium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the boreal forests of North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its berries are edible, though they are typically small, tart, and used in local culinary traditions. The species is adapted to acidic soils and cold climates, making it a hardy component of northern ecosystems."
