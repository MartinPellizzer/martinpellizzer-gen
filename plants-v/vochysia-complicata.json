    "intro": "Vochysia complicata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich aroma, making it important in both ecological and economic contexts. Vochysia complicata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
