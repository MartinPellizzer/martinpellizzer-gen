    "intro": "Vitis nodosa, commonly known as the nodding grape or nodding ivy, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Vitis nodosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
