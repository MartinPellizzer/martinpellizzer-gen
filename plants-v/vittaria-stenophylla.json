    "intro": "Vittaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
