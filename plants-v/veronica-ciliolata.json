    "intro": "Veronica ciliolata, commonly known as the hairy speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are ovate with hairy undersides, contributing to its common name. Veronica ciliolata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
