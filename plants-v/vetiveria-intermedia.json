    "intro": "Vetiveria intermedia, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscaping in arid regions. Vetiveria intermedia is also valued for its ability to produce a fragrant, fibrous material used in traditional crafts and as a natural dye."
