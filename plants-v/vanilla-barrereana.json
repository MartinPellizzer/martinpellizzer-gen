    "intro": "Vanilla barrereana, commonly known as the Borneo vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It produces long, fragrant tendrils that can reach several meters in length, which are used for climbing and supporting the plant. The plant's flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. Vanilla barrereana is valued for its aromatic pods, which are harvested and used in the production of vanilla extract. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
