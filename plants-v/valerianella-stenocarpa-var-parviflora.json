    "intro": "Valerianella stenocarpa var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-fruited valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Valerianella stenocarpa var. parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
