    "intro": "Vernonia polyanthes, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly landscapes."
