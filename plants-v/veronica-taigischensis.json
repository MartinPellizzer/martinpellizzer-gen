It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
