It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.
