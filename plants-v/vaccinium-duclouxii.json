    "intro": "Vaccinium duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux huckleberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acidic-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
