    "intro": "Vilobia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Vilobia is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
