    "intro": "Vetiveria zizanioides var. genuina, commonly known as African grass or vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2\u20133 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for soil stabilization and erosion control. Its rhizomatous root system makes it highly resilient to drought and extreme environmental conditions."
