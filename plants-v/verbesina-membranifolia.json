    "intro": "Verbesina membranifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant features showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, membranous texture. Verbesina membranifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
