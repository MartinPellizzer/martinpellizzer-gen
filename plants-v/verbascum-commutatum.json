    "intro": "Verbascum commutatum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, elongated spike. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of downy hair. Verbascum commutatum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
