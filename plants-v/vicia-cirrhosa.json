    "intro": "Vicia cirrhosa, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. Vicia cirrhosa is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
