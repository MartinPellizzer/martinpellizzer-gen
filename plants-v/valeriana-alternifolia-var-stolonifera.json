    "intro": "Valeriana alternifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a bushy growth habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their sedative properties. This variety is characterized by its stoloniferous growth, meaning it spreads via runners, making it a resilient ground cover plant."
