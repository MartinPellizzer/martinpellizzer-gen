    "intro": "Vitis obtusata var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf muscadine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clusters of greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. The berries are highly aromatic and have a sweet, musky flavor, making them popular for winemaking and culinary uses. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
