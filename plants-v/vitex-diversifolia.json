    "intro": "Vitex diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chaste tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Vitex diversifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
