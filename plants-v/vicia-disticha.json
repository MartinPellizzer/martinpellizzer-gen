It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters of two. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Vicia disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
