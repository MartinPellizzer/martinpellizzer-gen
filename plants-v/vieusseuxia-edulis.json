    "intro": "Vieusseuxia edulis, commonly known as the edible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. The plant's botanical adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
