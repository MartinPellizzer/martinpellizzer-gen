    "intro": "Valerianella balansae, commonly known as the dwarf valerian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils. It has a fine, aromatic scent, which is characteristic of the Valerianella genus. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
