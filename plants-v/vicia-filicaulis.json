    "intro": "Vicia filicaulis, commonly known as the fern-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Vicia filicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
