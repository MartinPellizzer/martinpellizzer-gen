    "intro": "Vittaria ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Vittaria ruiziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
