    "intro": "Vitis triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf grape or wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Vitis triphylla is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and moist soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
