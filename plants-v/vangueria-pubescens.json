    "intro": "Vangueria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name. Vangueria pubescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
