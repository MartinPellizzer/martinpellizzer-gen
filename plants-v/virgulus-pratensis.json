    "intro": "Virgulus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-rich environments. Virgulus pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
