It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy, typically blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
