    "intro": "Viburnum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
