    "intro": "Viburnum plicatum f. mariesii, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its unique, layered foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. It features compound leaves that are intricately folded, giving it a distinctive, quilt-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its seasonal changes, from vibrant spring foliage to striking autumn color."
