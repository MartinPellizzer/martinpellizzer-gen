    "intro": "Verbena juniperina var. grisea, commonly known as silver verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
