    "intro": "Vigna microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain round, edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is an important crop for its protein-rich seeds, which are used in various cuisines. Vigna microsperma also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
