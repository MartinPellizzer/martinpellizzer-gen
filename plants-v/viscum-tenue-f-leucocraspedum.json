    "intro": "Viscum tenue f. leucocraspedum, commonly known as the white-fringed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are pale green to white in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually white or pale yellow, which differ from the more common red or black berries of other mistletoe species. This form of mistletoe is often found in forests and is an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
