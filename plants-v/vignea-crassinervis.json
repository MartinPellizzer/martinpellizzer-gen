    "intro": "Vignea crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined vine, is a herbaceous climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to several meters, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with prominent, broad veins, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-white or pale yellow hues, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
