    "intro": "Verbascum decurrens var. nigrolychnitis, commonly known as the black-lantern mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is distinguished by its dark, almost black, floral bracts that contrast with its bright yellow flowers."
