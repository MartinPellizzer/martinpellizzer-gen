    "intro": "Vasconcellia tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, and it produces small, violet-colored flowers. Its fruits are typically berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
