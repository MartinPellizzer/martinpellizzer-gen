    "intro": "Vernonia ramellae, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia ramellae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
