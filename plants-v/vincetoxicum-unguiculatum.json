    "intro": "Vincetoxicum unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in gardens. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges."
