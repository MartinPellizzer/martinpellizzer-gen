    "intro": "Ventilago ecorollata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
