    "intro": "Vitis adnata, commonly known as the river grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, sweet-tasting berries. Its vines are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to cover structures. Botanically, it is characterized by its tendrils, which help it climb, and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
