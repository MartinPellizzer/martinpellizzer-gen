    "intro": "Verbesina pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a small annual herb native to North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom from late summer to early fall. Its flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Verbesina pusilla is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
