    "intro": "Victoria regina, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The leaves are supported by long, thick petioles that anchor them to the mud below. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are white and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
