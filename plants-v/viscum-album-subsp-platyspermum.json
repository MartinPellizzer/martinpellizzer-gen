    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. platyspermum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are thick and fleshy. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in forest ecosystems. Its presence can affect the growth and health of its host trees."
