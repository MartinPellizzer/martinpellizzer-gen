    "intro": "Viscum myrtilloides, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a glossy appearance. Viscum myrtilloides is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in many European countries."
