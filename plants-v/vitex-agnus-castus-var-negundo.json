    "intro": "Vitex agnus-castus var. negundo, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically in herbal medicine. The varietal form 'negundo' distinguishes it from the more common 'agnus-castus' by its narrower foliage and slightly different growth habits."
