    "intro": "Vernonia scorpioides var. longeracemosa, commonly known as the long-headed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures called pappi, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and ecological restoration projects."
