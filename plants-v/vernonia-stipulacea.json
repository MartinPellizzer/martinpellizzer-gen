    "intro": "Vernonia stipulacea, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, erect stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia stipulacea is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
