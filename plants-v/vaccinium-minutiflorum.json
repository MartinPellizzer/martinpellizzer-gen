    "intro": "Vaccinium minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to white in color, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are dark green and leathery, providing dense foliage that helps retain moisture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. The berries it produces are small, tart, and edible, often used in local culinary traditions."
