It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance."
