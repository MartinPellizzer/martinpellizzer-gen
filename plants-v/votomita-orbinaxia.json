    "intro": "Votomita orbinaxia, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. Votomita orbinaxia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
