    "intro": "Valeriana petrophila, commonly known as the alpine valerian, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and is considered an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valeriana petrophila is vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
