    "intro": "Veronica denkichiana var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
