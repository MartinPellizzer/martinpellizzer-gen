    "intro": "Vitis serrulata, commonly known as the toothache vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by grape-like berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported analgesic properties. Vitis serrulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
