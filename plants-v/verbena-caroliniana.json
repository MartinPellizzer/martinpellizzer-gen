    "intro": "Verbena caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as swamps and wetlands. The plant produces showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Carolina verbena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a useful plant for wetland restoration projects."
