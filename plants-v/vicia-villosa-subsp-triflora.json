    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. triflora, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, twisted pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural fields."
