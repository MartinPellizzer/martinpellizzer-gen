    "intro": "Verbenella chamaedryfolia, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
