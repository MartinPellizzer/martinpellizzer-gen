    "intro": "Viburnum grandiflorum, commonly known as the common snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its foliage. The plant produces showy, rounded inflorescences called cymes, which can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Viburnum grandiflorum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
