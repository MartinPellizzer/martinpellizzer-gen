    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. langeanum, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic peat bogs in northern regions. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wet soils and is adapted to cold climates. The flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, appearing in early summer."
