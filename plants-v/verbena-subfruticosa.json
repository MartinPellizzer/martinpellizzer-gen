    "intro": "Verbena subfruticosa, commonly known as the coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbena subfruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
