    "intro": "Valerianella dentata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It produces small, round fruits that are often clustered together, giving it its \"hairy-fruited\" designation. Valerianella dentata var. dasycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
