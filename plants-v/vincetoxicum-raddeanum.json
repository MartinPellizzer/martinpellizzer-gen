    "intro": "Vincetoxicum raddeanum, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a reddish hue during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds such as cytisine. Vincetoxicum raddeanum thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
