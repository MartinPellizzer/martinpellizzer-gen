    "intro": "Vella mairei subvar. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly vella, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the cold and intense UV radiation of its environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subvariety eriocarpa is distinguished by its particularly dense and hairy growth, which gives it its common name."
