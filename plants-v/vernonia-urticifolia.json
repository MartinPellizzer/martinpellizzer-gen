    "intro": "Vernonia urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettle plants, though its leaves can cause skin irritation upon contact."
