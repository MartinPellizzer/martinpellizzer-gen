    "intro": "Veronicastrum sibiricum f. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian blueweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with whorled, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
