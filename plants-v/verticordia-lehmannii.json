    "intro": "Verticordia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's featherflower, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, candle-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange-red. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its resilience to drought. Verticordia lehmannii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in native gardens."
