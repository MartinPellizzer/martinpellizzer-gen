    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. tomentosum, commonly known as fuzzy mullein, is a variant of the common mullein plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in soft, downy hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem, and bloom in late summer to early autumn."
