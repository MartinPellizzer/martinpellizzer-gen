    "intro": "Vicia sepium, commonly known as common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Vicia sepium thrives in disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, in fields, and in woodland edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
