    "intro": "Vicia erecta, commonly known as the upright vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Vicia erecta is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a legume, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
