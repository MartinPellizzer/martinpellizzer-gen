    "intro": "Vriesea minor, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-blue waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea minor is a popular choice for indoor gardens due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
