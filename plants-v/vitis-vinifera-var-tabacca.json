It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that have a distinct tobacco-like aroma and flavor. The plant is a deciduous vine with compound leaves and tendrils typical of the Vitis genus. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique taste profile, it is occasionally used in specialty wines and herbal preparations."
