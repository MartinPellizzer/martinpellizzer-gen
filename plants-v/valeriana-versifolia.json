It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Valeriana versifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows."
