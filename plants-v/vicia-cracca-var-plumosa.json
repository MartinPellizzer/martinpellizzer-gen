It is a perennial legume characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
