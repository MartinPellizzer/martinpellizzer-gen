    "intro": "Valerianella microcephala, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its small head-like clusters of flowers, which are characteristic of the Valerianaceae family."
