    "intro": "Vanilla viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered vanilla, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vigorous climbing habit. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with partial shade. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for vanilla flavoring due to its low yield and specific pollination requirements."
