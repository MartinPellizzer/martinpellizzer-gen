    "intro": "Vimen cotinifolia, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of bright purple berries that appear in the fall, which are a key feature in its botanical description. The plant has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for wildlife, particularly birds."
