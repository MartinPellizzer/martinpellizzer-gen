    "intro": "Viola nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem violet, is a delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that are often leafless near the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple or blue, typically with five petals and a distinctive spur. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Viola nudicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
