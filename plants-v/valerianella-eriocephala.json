    "intro": "Valerianella eriocephala, commonly known as common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a distinctive, sometimes pungent aroma due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in cultivated gardens. Valerianella eriocephala is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its sedative properties."
