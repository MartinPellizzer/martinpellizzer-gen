    "intro": "Verbesina callilepis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, bristly hairs and produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Verbesina callilepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
