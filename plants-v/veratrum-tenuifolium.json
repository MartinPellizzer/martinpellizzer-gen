    "intro": "Veratrum tenuifolium, commonly known as western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Veratrum tenuifolium thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
