It is a small annual grass that typically grows in dry, rocky environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. It is adapted to high temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species. Vulpia aetnensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological studies."
