It features compound leaves with ovate to elliptic leaflets and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its showy, red-hued berries that appear in the fall, attracting birds and adding ornamental value. Viburnum taquetii is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
