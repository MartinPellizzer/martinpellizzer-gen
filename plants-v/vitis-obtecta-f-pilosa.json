    "intro": "Vitis obtecta f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy grape, is a variant of the grapevine species Vitis obtecta. It is characterized by its hairy foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered fruits. While not widely cultivated for commercial use, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
