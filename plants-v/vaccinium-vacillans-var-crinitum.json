It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. This variant is distinguished by its unique, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, acidic berries that are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
