    "intro": "Vigna virescens, commonly known as the green pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green and heart-shaped, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several round, edible seeds. Vigna virescens is valued for its nutritional content, including protein and essential minerals, and is often cultivated for both food and forage. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
