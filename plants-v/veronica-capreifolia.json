    "intro": "Veronica capreifolia, commonly known as the rock speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Veronica capreifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive flowers."
