    "intro": "Vaccinium \u00d7 dobbinii, commonly known as the crossberry, is a hybrid evergreen shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Vaccinium oxycoccos (bog bilberry) and Vaccinium myrtillus (blueberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, edible berries that are a mix of the flavors of its parent species. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
