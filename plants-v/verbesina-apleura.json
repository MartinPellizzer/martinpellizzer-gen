    "intro": "Verbesina apleura, commonly known as the broadleaf beggar-ticks, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
