    "intro": "Veronica \u00d7 andersonii variegata-nana, commonly known as the dwarf variegated speedwell, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, oval to heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of white, green, and sometimes yellow. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
