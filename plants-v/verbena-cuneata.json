    "intro": "Verbena cuneata, commonly known as swamp verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, purple, and blue, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Verbena cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions."
