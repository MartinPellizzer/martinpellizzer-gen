    "intro": "Veronica subacaulis, commonly known as the slender speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It features upright, branching stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Veronica subacaulis is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
