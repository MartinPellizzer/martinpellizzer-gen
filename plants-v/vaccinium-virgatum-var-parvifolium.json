    "intro": "Vaccinium virgatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as small-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval, dark green leaves and produces bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, edible berries that are typically blue or red, depending on the variety and ripeness. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and pollinators."
