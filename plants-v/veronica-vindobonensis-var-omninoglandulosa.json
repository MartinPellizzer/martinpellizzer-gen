It features slender, erect stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also bear the same silvery coating, enhancing its visual appeal. Its flowers are small, blue or violet, and clustered in whorls along the stem, typical of the Veronica genus. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
