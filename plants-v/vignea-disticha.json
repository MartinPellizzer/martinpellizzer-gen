    "intro": "Vignea disticha, commonly known as the two-branched vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and slender, twining stems that support its compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Vignea disticha thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
