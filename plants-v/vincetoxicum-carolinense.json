It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread. Vincetoxicum carolinense is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
