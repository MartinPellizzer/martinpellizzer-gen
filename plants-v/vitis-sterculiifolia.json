    "intro": "Vitis sterculiifolia, commonly known as the African grape or desert grape, is a woody vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red or black when ripe. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Vitis sterculiifolia is often used in traditional medicine and has potential for cultivation in drought-resistant agricultural systems."
