    "intro": "Vaccinium taxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blue-black berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
