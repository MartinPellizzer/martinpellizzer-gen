    "intro": "Valerioa, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Valerianaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or ovate, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. Valerioa species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have historical uses in traditional medicine."
