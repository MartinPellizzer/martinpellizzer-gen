    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is noted for its adaptability to wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
