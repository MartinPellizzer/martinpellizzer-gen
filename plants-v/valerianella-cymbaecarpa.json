It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic, licorice-like scent, which comes from compounds such as apiol and limonene.

It is also valued for its culinary uses, particularly in traditional European cuisine."
