    "intro": "Verbesina subcordata, commonly known as the broadleaf beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which can make handling the plant uncomfortable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
