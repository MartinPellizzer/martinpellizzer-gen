    "intro": "Vernonia praealta, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a prominent feature in wildflower meadows. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia praealta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
