    "intro": "Varronia leucophlyctis, commonly known as the white-leaf varronia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often white- or pale-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Varronia leucophlyctis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
