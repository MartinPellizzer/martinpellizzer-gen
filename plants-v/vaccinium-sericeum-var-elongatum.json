    "intro": "Vaccinium sericeum var. elongatum, commonly known as the silver-leaved huckleberry, is a variant of the common huckleberry found in temperate regions. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with elliptical, leathery leaves that are densely covered in silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
