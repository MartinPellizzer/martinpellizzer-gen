    "intro": "Vellozia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Velloziaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Vellozia albiflora is often found in rocky soils and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
