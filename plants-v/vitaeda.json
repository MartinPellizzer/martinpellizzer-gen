    "intro": "Vitaeda, commonly known as the golden vine, is a striking plant native to tropical regions. It features long, trailing stems that produce clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, adding a lush aesthetic to gardens or hanging baskets. Vitaeda thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
