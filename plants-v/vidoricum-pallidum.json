    "intro": "Vidoricum pallidum, commonly known as the pale vidore, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vidoricum pallidum is considered a vulnerable species."
