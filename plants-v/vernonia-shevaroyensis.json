It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
