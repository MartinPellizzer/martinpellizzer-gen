    "intro": "Vaccinium punctifolium, commonly known as the spotted leaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern North America. It is characterized by its small, oval, leathery leaves that are often spotted with white or silver markings. The plant produces bell-shaped, pale pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or dune environments. Vaccinium punctifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
