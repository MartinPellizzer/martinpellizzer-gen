    "intro": "Viburnum sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowers, and fruit, as well as its ability to attract pollinators and wildlife."
