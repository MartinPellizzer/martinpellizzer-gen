    "intro": "Vitis albida, commonly known as the white grape vine, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its pale green to white stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically white or yellow in color. Vitis albida is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
