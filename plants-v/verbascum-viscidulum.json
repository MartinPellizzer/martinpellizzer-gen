    "intro": "Verbascum viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and broad, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Verbascum viscidulum is known for its sticky hairs, which give it its common name and help protect it from herbivores."
