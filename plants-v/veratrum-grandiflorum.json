    "intro": "Veratrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the grandiflorous white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
