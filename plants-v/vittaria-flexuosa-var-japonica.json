    "intro": "Vittaria flexuosa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese chain fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, cascading foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria flexuosa var. japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique, fern-like appearance."
