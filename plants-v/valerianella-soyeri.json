    "intro": "Valerianella soyeri, commonly known as the Persian pennywort, is a low-growing annual plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens or along the edges of water features. Valerianella soyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
