    "intro": "Vanilla \u00d7 tahitensis var. haapape, commonly known as Tahitian vanilla, is a tropical orchid species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark brown pods that develop from the pollination of its unique, self-pollinating flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and the presence of a specialized pollinator, the Melipona bee, which is essential for fruit set. The vanilla beans harvested from this variety are prized for their rich, complex flavor and are widely used in culinary and fragrance applications."
