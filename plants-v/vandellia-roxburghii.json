    "intro": "Vandellia roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
