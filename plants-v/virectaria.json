    "intro": "Virectaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Virectaria is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
