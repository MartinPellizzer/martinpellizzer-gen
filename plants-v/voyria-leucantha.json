    "intro": "Voyria leucantha, commonly known as the white-violet or white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its reliance on host species such as grasses and sedges. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
