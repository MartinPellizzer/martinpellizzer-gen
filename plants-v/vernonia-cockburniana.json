    "intro": "Vernonia cockburniana, commonly known as the Cockburn's ironweed, is a striking perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
