    "intro": "Valerianella eriocarpa subsp. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive truncate (cut-off) appearance at the base. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, fuzzy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
