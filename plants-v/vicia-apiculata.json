    "intro": "Vicia apiculata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are followed by elongated, slender pods. Vicia apiculata is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions as a forage crop."
