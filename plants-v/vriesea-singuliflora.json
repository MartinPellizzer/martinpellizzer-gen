    "intro": "Vriesea singuliflora, commonly known as the \"Cape Lily,\" is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence that resembles a lily, with vibrant orange or yellow flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea singuliflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
