    "intro": "Veronica connata var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the \"glaberrima\" variety is notable for its reduced hair coverage compared to other forms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
