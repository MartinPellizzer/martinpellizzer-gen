    "intro": "Villanova achilleoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
