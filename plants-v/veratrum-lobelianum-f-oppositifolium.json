    "intro": "Veratrum lobelianum f. oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore species native to North America. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
