    "intro": "Vittaria arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese sheet moss, is a small, evergreen epiphytic moss belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral, with a distinctive midrib and a smooth, glossy surface. Vittaria arisanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
