    "intro": "Vaccinium villosum, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a velvety texture, and the plant is known for its ability to form dense thickets. Vaccinium villosum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
