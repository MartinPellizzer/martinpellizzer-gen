    "intro": "Vochysia fontellae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
