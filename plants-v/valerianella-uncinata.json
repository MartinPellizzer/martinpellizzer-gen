    "intro": "Valerianella uncinata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with hairy surfaces and produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Valerianella uncinata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
