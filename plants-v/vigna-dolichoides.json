It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods. The plant is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Vigna dolichoides also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
