    "intro": "Vigna helicopus, commonly known as the spiral bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features twisted, helical stems that allow it to coil around supports as it grows. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Vigna helicopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and nutritional value, making it both a garden plant and a food source."
