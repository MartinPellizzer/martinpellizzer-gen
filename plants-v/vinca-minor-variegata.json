    "intro": "Vinca minor variegata, commonly known as Persian violet or dwarf periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white, green, and gold, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled blue or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly tolerant of moist, well-drained soil. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent ground cover for suppressing weeds and enhancing the aesthetic of shaded garden areas."
