    "intro": "Vitis goyazensis, commonly known as Goyazine grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its climbing vines and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Vitis goyazensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance. However, it is not widely used for fruit production due to the small size and tart flavor of its berries."
