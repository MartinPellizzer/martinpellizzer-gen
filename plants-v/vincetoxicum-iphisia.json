    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vincetoxicum ipphisia, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its clusters of orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, orange berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Vincetoxicum ipphisia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and showy flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
