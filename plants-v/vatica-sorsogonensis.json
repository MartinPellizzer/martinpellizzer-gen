    "intro": "Vatica sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Province ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forests, thriving in humid, warm climates. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
