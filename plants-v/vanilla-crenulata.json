    "intro": "Vanilla crenulata, commonly known as the fragrant vanilla orchid, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into the characteristic vanilla pods, which are harvested for their aromatic extract. Vanilla crenulata thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its cultivation requires careful management due to its specific climatic and horticultural needs."
