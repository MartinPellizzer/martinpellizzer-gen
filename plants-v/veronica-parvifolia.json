    "intro": "Veronica parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features tiny, blue or violet flowers clustered in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Veronica parvifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodlands, and along stream banks."
