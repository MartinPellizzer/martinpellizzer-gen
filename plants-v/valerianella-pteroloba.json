    "intro": "Valerianella pteroloba, commonly known as the rosette valerian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Valerianella pteroloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for its mild sedative properties."
