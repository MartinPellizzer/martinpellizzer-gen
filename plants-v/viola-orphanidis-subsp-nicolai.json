    "intro": "Viola orphanidis subsp. nicolai, commonly known as the Nicolai violet, is a rare and distinctive member of the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
