    "intro": "Viola ovalleana, commonly known as the ovalleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, usually appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Viola ovalleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
