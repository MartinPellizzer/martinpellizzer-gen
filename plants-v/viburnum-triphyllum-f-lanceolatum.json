    "intro": "Viburnum triphyllum f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf swamp dewberry, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for moist, shaded woodland environments."
