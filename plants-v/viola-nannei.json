    "intro": "Viola nannei, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, Viola nannei is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
