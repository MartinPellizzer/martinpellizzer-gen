    "intro": "Viburnum carnosulum, commonly known as the woollyleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly-textured leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Viburnum carnosulum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
