    "intro": "Verbena longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered vervain, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite along the stems and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Verbena longiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
