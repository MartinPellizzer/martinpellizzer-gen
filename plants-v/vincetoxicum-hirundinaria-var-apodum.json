    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirundinaria var. apodum, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features striking, compound leaves that are palmately lobed and often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into autumn. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant are poisonous to humans and animals."
