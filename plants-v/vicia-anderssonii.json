    "intro": "Vicia anderssonii, commonly known as Andersson's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Vicia anderssonii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
