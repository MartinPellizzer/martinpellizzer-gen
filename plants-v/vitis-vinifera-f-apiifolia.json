    "intro": "Vitis vinifera f. apiifolia, commonly known as the honey-leaf grape, is a unique cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features a pale yellow to white variegation pattern on the leaves. This variegation is due to reduced chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique aesthetic appeal. The plant is typically grown as an ornamental due to its striking leaf coloration, though it can also be used in small-scale viticulture. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure to thrive."
