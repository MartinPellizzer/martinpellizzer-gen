    "intro": "Vachellia nilotica subsp. hemispherica, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by closely spaced, thorned branches. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods that contain seeds. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder."
