    "intro": "Veratrum album var. californicum, commonly known as California white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Veratrum genus. Its roots and stems contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
