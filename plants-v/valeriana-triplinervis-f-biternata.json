    "intro": "Valeriana triplinervis f. biternata, commonly known as the three-veined valerian, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the valerian genus. It is characterized by its distinct trifoliate leaves, which have three main veins, a feature that sets it apart from other members of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are adapted for insect pollination. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
