    "intro": "Viola bubanii, commonly known as the Buban's violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Viola bubanii is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
