It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its root system is notable for containing compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished from other valerian species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
