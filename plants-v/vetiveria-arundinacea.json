It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. Its rhizomes are harvested for various applications, including as a natural filter in water treatment. Vetiver is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of biofuel."
