    "intro": "Vittaria crispomarginata, commonly known as the crinkled margin fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a crinkled or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to its host. Vittaria crispomarginata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
