    "intro": "Volutarella omphalodes, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a distinctive spirally coiled seed pod that opens to release its seeds when submerged in water. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Volutarella omphalodes has been culturally significant in many Asian societies for centuries, often symbolizing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
