    "intro": "Viburnum oleifolium, commonly known as the oliveleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often has a distinctive, aromatic scent. Viburnum oleifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
