    "intro": "Viola propera, commonly known as the common violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Viola propera has a short stem and produces small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat."
