    "intro": "Vincetoxicum nivale, commonly known as snow vine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Vincetoxicum nivale is valued in horticulture for its delicate blooms and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
