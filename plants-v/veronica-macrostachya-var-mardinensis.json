    "intro": "Veronica macrostachya var. mardinensis, commonly known as the Mardin speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
