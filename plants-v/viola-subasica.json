    "intro": "Viola subasica, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow beard on the lower lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Viola genus. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Viola subasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
