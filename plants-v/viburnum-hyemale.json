    "intro": "Viburnum hyemale, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy, violet-blue berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Viburnum hyemale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits, as the berries provide food for birds."
