    "intro": "Viburnum recognitum, commonly known as the doubleflower viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of white, double-flowered blooms that appear in early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. Its fruit is a dark blue to black drupe, which is edible but not particularly flavorful. Viburnum recognitum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
