    "intro": "Vitis sphaerophylla, commonly known as the spherical-leaf grapevine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, rounded leaves and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant is a woody vine that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered in the wild."
