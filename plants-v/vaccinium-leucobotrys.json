    "intro": "Vaccinium leucobotrys, commonly known as the white-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and azaleas. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically white or pale green, which distinguish it from other Vaccinium species. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
