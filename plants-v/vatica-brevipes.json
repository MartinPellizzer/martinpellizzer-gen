    "intro": "Vatica brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Vatica brevipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
