    "intro": "Vitis humulifolia f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth river grape, is a variant of the river grape vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Vitis humulifolia. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along streams and riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
