It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and short flowering period make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
