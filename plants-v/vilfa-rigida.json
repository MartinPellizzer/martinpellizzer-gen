    "intro": "Vilfa rigida, commonly known as rigid vilfa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has hairy, rigid stems that help it retain moisture. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Vilfa rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
