    "intro": "Viburnum jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, upright clusters of white flowers in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Viburnum jamesonii thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
