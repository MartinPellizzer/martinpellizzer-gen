    "intro": "Verbena glabrata, commonly known as the smooth verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. Verbena glabrata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies add to its horticultural value."
