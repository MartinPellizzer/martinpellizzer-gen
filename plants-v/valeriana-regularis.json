    "intro": "Valeriana regularis, commonly known as the common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Valeriana regularis is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and has been used historically for its sedative properties."
