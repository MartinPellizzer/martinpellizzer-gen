    "intro": "Vriesea proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea proctorii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
