    "intro": "Verbascum suworowianum var. pseudopersicum, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in soft hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, branching inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its resemblance to other mullein species."
