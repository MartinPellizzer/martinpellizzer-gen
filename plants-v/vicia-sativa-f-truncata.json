    "intro": "Vicia sativa f. truncata, commonly known as the truncated vetch, is a botanical variant of the common vetch. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the standard form. The leaves are trifoliate, with the terminal leaflet being truncated or notched at the tip, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
