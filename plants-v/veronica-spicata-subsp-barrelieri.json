    "intro": "Veronica spicata subsp. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
