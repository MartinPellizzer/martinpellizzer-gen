    "intro": "Veronica filipes, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Veronica filipes is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through rhizomes."
