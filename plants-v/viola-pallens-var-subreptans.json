It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, pale violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it is often found in colonies. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
