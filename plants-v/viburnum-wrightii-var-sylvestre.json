    "intro": "Viburnum wrightii var. sylvestre, commonly known as the swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats, such as swamps and stream banks, and features compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with rough, furrowed bark, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to wildlife."
