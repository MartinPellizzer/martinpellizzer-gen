    "intro": "Veratrum oblongum, commonly known as the Indian arrowroot or purple cowbane, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, stout stems and large, showy white or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture."
