It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces numerous slender, branching inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. Veronica longiracemosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges."
