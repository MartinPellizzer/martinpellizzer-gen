    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 parvifloriforme, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum parviflorum. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typical of the mullein genus. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance and ease of growth."
