    "intro": "Valerianella auricula, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears. It typically features pink or white flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Valerianella auricula has a hairy stem and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its preferred habitats. It is often found in association with other early spring flora, blooming from late spring to early summer."
