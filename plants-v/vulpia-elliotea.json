    "intro": "Vulpia elliotea, commonly known as the Elliot's vulpia, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats."
