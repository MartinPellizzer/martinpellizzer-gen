    "intro": "Vietnamochloa, commonly known as the Vietnamese grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plants are characterized by their slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Vietnamochloa species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. These plants play a role in local ecosystems and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
