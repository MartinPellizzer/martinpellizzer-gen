    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. smilacina, commonly known as the climbing buckler vine, is a woody vine native to North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
