    "intro": "Vittaria intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal vittaria, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, mat-like growth on tree bark or rocks. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the fern family. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Vittaria intramarginalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
