    "intro": "Vandellia cleistandra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is notable for its peculiar, lantern-like flower that remains closed throughout its blooming period. The plant's flowers open only at night, emitting a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, carrion beetles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in crevices or on rock faces. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vandellia cleistandra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
