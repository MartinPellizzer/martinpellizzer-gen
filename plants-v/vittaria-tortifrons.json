    "intro": "Vittaria tortifrons, commonly known as the twisted-frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, twisted fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria tortifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
