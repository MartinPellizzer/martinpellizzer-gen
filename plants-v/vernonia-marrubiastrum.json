It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.
