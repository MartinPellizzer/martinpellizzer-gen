    "intro": "Vulpia myuros var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Vulpia myuros var. hirsuta is often found in open, sunny habitats and is considered a characteristic species of dry meadows and grasslands."
