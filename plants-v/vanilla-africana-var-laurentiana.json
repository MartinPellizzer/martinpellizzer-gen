    "intro": "Vanilla africana var. laurentiana, commonly known as the African vanilla or Laurentian vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, slender pod-like fruit, which develops after successful pollination. The fruit contains tiny, dark brown seeds embedded in a sweet, aromatic pulp. This variety is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
