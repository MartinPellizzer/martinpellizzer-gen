It features trifoliate leaves with a sour, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid and other organic compounds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both culinary and ornamental gardens."
