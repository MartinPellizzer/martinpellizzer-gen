    "intro": "Veronica laeta var. arenosa, commonly known as the sand veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This plant is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
