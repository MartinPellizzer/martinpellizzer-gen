    "intro": "Velvitsia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like material, which aids in their dispersal. Velvitsia is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
