    "intro": "Veronica prostrata var. satureiifolia, commonly known as the prostrate speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
