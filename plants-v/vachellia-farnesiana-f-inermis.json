    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana f. inermis, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by legume pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and high temperatures. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by the absence of thorns, making it less defensive but more suitable for certain horticultural applications."
