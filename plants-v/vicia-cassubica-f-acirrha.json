    "intro": "Vicia cassubica f. acirrha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a rare botanical variant of the common vetch. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and trifoliate, with a distinctive pubescent surface. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
