    "intro": "Vagnera flexuosa, commonly known as the wavy vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its flexible, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a wavy or undulating margin, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Vagnera flexuosa is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
