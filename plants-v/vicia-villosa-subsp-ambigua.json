    "intro": "Vicia villosa subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates."
