    "intro": "Vilfa aenea, commonly known as the silverleaf lily, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Vilfa aenea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its resilience and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
