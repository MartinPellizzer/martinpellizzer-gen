    "intro": "Vitis lenticellata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy labrusca grape, is a lesser-known variety of vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"hirsuta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically not used for winemaking but are of interest to botanists and horticulturists. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five lobes and small, clustered flowers. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to humid climates."
