    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered violet, is a botanical variant of the viola genus characterized by its pale or white petals. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is typically found in woodland or shaded areas. It possesses heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, typical of many viola species. The flowers are small, usually less than 2 inches in diameter, and bloom in early spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other viola varieties."
