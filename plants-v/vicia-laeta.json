    "intro": "Vicia laeta, commonly known as the silver vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Vicia laeta is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind or animals."
