    "intro": "Viola suavis subsp. catalonica, commonly known as the Catalan violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
