    "intro": "Veronica albicans, commonly known as the white speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Veronica albicans is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
