    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. typica, commonly known as the sandbar grape, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it can reach lengths of up to 20 feet. It is an important species for ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems."
