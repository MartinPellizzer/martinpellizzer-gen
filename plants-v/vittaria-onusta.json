    "intro": "Vittaria onusta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure, often covering the surface it inhabits. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Vittaria onusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
