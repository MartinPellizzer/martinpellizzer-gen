    "intro": "Vancouveria, commonly known as the fairy bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to western North America. It consists of three species, all of which are herbaceous perennials with distinctive blue or violet flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Vancouveria has lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blooms in the spring. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and conservation efforts."
