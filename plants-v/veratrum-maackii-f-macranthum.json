    "intro": "Veratrum maackii f. macranthum, commonly known as the Macranthum form of Maack's arrowroot, is a variant of the evergreen perennial plant native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
