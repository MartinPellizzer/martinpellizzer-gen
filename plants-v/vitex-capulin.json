    "intro": "Vitex capulin, commonly known as Mexican vitex, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Vitex capulin thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to arid conditions and drought tolerance further enhance its value in native plant gardens."
