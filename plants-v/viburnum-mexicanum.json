    "intro": "Viburnum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican hawthorn, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Viburnum mexicanum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or scrub habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
