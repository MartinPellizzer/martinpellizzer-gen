It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces elongated pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both human consumption and animal feed. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it an important crop for soil fertility."
