It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that typically display vibrant colors. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal regions. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
