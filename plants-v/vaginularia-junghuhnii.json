    "intro": "Vaginularia junghuhnii, commonly known as the sea tulip, is a marine colonial polychaete worm found in tropical and subtropical waters. It forms dense, gelatinous colonies that are often anchored to substrates such as rocks or coral. The plant-like appearance of the colony is due to its branching, tubular structures that resemble flowers. Each individual within the colony is a tiny, segmented worm, connected by a shared body cavity. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to benthic communities and serving as a habitat for small organisms."
