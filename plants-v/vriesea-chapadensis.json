    "intro": "Vriesea chapadensis, commonly known as the golden torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features a striking, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a torch, with bright yellow bracts that contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant's rosette of narrow, leathery leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, supporting a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea chapadensis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
