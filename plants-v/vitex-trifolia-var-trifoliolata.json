    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically along a central stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer months.

The species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
