    "intro": "Veronica polyphylla, commonly known as the clustered speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
