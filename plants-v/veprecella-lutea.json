    "intro": "Veprecella lutea, commonly known as the yellow veprecella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Veprecella lutea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
