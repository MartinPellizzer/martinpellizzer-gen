    "intro": "Vitex cymosa, commonly known as the clustered chaste tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, dispersing through wind or animals. Vitex cymosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
