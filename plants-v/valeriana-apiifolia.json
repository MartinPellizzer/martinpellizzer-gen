    "intro": "Valeriana apiifolia, commonly known as garden valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, pinnately divided leaves that resemble those of the carrot plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its sedative and calming properties. Valeriana apiifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
