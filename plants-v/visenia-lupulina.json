    "intro": "Visenia lupulina, commonly known as the hop tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of cone-like fruits. Its roots are known to be deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
