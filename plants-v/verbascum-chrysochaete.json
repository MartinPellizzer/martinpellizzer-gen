It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has soft, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Verbascum chrysochaete is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
