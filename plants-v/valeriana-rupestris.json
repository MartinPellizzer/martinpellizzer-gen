    "intro": "Valeriana rupestris, commonly known as the rock valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round fruits. Valeriana rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
