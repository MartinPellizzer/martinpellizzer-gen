    "intro": "Verbesina rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid beggar-tick, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are covered in fine hairs and produce clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The leaves are rhomboid in shape, hence the species name, and are often hairy on both surfaces. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks. The plant is known for its prickly, bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal."
