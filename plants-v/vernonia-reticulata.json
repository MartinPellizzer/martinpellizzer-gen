    "intro": "Vernonia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green leaves with a distinct net-like venation pattern. Its showy yellow-orange flower heads appear in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia reticulata is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
