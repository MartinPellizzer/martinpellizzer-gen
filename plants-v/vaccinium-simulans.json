    "intro": "Vaccinium simulans, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from blue to black. Vaccinium simulans thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and seasonal blooms."
