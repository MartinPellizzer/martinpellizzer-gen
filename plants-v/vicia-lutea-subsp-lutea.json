    "intro": "Vicia lutea subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a herbaceous legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, and it thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in open fields. Vicia lutea subsp. lutea is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
