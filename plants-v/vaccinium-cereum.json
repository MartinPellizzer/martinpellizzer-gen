    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum, commonly known as the waxy bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. The plant is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and tundra ecosystems. Vaccinium cereum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
