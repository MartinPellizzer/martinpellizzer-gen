    "intro": "Valerianella woodsiana var. patellaria, commonly known as the dwarf valerian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
