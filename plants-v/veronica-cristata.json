    "intro": "Veronica cristata, commonly known as the crested speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Veronica cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
