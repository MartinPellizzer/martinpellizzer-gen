    "intro": "Vaccinium salviifolium, commonly known as the blueberry shrub, is a deciduous evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which develop into the edible blue berries after a period of cold stratification. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are commonly used in culinary applications, while the plant also plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
