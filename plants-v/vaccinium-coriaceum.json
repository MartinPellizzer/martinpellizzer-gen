    "intro": "Vaccinium coriaceum, commonly known as the leatherleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that provide dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are edible, though they are small and often used in local cuisines or for wildlife food. Vaccinium coriaceum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and swamps."
