    "intro": "Verbascum syriacum, commonly known as Syrian mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a tall, upright spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Due to its medicinal and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its therapeutic properties and aesthetic appeal."
