    "intro": "Verbesina chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
