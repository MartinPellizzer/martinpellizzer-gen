    "intro": "Vriesea antillana, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange and red inflorescence that resembles a torch, which blooms for several months. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly recurved, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Vriesea antillana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
