    "intro": "Varronia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican varronia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of the understory in tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain seeds. Varronia portoricensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
