    "intro": "Vitis praecox, commonly known as the early grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or greenish in color, which appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that emerge after the flowers. Its berries are usually small and can be either green or red, depending on the variety. Vitis praecox is often found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
