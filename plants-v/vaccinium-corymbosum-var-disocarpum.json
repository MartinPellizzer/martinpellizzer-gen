It is characterized by its smaller, more acidic berries compared to the typical blueberry. The plant is native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, thriving in acidic, well-drained soils. It has compact growth habits and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fruit. This variety is also valued for its potential in wild blueberry cultivation."
