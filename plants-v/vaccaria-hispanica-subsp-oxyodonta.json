    "intro": "Vaccaria hispanica subsp. oxyodonta, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, branched stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
