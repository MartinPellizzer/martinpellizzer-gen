It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Veronica genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
