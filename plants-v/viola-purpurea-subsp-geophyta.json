    "intro": "Viola purpurea subsp. geophyta, commonly known as the purple violet or woodland violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. Its underground stems, known as rhizomes, allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms and foliage."
