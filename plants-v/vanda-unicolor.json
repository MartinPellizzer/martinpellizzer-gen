    "intro": "Vanda unicolor, commonly known as the single-colored vanda, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a single coloration. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Vanda unicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
