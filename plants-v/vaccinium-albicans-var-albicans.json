    "intro": "Vaccinium albicans var. albicans, commonly known as the white highbush blueberry, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, white to pale blue berries. These berries are low in acidity and have a sweet, delicate flavor, making them suitable for fresh consumption or use in jams and desserts. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
