    "intro": "Viborgia supina, commonly known as the prostrate viborgia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Viborgia supina is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
