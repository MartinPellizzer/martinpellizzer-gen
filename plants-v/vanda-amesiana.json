    "intro": "Vanda amesiana, commonly known as the Ames' vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red lip. Vanda amesiana thrives in humid, tropical climates with bright indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall."
