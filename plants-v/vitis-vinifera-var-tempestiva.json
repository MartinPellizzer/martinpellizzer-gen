    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. tempestiva, commonly known as the Tempest Grape, is a rare and unique cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its exceptionally large, thick-skinned berries that exhibit a deep, almost black coloration. This variety is notable for its high sugar content and intense flavor profile, which includes notes of dark fruit and spice. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season to develop its full potential. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is primarily cultivated in specialized vineyards and is highly sought after by connoisseurs."
