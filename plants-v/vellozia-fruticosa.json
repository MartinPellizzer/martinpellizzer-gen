    "intro": "Vellozia fruticosa, commonly known as the Natal grass or Natal vellozia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, delicate white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Vellozia fruticosa is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
