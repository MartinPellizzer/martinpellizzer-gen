    "intro": "Varronia polystachya, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
