    "intro": "Vanda insularum, commonly known as the Island Vanda, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they anchor to surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. Vanda insularum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
