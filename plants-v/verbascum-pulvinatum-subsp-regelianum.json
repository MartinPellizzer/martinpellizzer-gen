    "intro": "Verbascum pulvinatum subsp. regelianum, commonly known as the Regelian mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and also covered with a thick layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
