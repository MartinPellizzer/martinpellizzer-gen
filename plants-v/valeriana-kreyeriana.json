    "intro": "Valeriana kreyeriana, commonly known as Kreyer's valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Valeriana kreyeriana is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other valerian species."
