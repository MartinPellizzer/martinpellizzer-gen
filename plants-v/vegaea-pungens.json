It is characterized by its sharp, spiny leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown in gardens or as a houseplant. The flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
