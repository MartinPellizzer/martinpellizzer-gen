    "intro": "Vernonia kraussii var. oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other Vernonia species."
