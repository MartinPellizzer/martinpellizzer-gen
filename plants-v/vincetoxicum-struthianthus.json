    "intro": "Vincetoxicum struthianthus, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Adoxaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Vincetoxicum struthianthus is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks."
