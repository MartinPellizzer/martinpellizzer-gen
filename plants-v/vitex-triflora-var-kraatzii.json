    "intro": "Vitex triflora var. kraatzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, narrow, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue-violet flowers in panicles during the late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
