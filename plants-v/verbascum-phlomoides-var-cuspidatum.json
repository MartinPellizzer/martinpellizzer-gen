    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically tubular and arranged in a spike-like formation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is closely related to other mullein species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
