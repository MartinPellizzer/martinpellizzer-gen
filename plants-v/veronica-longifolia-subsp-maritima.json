    "intro": "Veronica longifolia subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea veronica, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
