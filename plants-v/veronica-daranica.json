    "intro": "Veronica daranica, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Veronica daranica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
