    "intro": "Vicia polymorpha, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. Vicia polymorpha is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
