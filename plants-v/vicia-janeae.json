It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Vicia janeae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
