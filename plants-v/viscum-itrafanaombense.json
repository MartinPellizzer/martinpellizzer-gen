    "intro": "Viscum itrafanaombense, commonly known as the Itrafanaombene mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Madagascar. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Viscum itrafanaombense is considered a rare and endemic species."
