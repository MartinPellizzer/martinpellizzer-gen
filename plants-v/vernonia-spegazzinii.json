    "intro": "Vernonia spegazzinii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Vernonia spegazzinii is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor, rocky soils. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
