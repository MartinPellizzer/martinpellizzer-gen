    "intro": "Viguiera gilliesii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its rugged, drought-tolerant nature. Viguiera gilliesii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun."
