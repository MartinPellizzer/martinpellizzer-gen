    "intro": "Vicia lutescens, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Vicia lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
