    "intro": "Vicia, commonly known as the vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Vicia species are typically annual or perennial herbs that produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white. They are well-known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts. Many species are also cultivated as forage crops or ornamental plants."
