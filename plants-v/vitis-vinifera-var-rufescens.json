    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. rufescens, commonly known as the red muscat grape, is a lesser-known variety within the Vitis vinifera species. It is characterized by its small, red-colored berries that are typically used in winemaking rather than for table consumption. The plant exhibits vigorous growth, with deep green, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and requires a long growing season to produce its distinctive fruit. Due to its rarity and specific cultivation needs, it is not as widely cultivated as other Vitis vinifera varieties."
