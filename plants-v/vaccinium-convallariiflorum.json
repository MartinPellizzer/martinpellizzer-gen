It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and remain green throughout the year. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
