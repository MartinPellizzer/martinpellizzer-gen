    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 varciorovae, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typical of the genus Verbascum. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum phlomoides."
