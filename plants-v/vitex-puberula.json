    "intro": "Vitex puberula, commonly known as velvetleaf vitex, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex puberula is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in partial to full sunlight."
