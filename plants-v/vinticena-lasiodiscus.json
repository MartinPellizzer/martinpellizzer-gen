    "intro": "Vinticena lasiodiscus, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
