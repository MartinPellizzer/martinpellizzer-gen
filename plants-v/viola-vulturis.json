    "intro": "Viola vulturis, commonly known as the \"vulture violet,\" is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola vulturis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
