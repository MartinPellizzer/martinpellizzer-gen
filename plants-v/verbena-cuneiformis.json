    "intro": "Verbena cuneiformis, commonly known as slender verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Verbena cuneiformis is a perennial herb that produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures, contributing to its propagation in suitable conditions."
