    "intro": "Vera-duthiea zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-yellow hues, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
