    "intro": "Vigna minima, commonly known as the dwarf pigeon pea, is a small leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing 2-4 round, edible seeds. It is drought-tolerant and often used as a forage crop or in traditional medicine. Vigna minima is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility."
