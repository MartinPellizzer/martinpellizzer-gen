    "intro": "Viscum villosum, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Viscum villosum is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
