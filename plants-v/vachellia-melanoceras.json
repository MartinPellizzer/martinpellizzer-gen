    "intro": "Vachellia melanoceras, commonly known as the black thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
