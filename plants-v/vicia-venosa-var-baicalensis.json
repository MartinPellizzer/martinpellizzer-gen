It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
