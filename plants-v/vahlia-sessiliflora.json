    "intro": "Vahlia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered vahlia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive calyx that persists after flowering. Vahlia sessiliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
