    "intro": "Vaccinium dempoense, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
