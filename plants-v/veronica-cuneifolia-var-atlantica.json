    "intro": "Veronica cuneifolia var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bentweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in spikes during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
