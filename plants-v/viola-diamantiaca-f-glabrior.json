    "intro": "Viola diamantiaca f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved shieldflower, is a rare and striking member of the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and vibrant violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in Greece and Albania. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after species in specialized horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
