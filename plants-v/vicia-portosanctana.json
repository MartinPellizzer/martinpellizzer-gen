It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
