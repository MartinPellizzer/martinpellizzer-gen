    "intro": "Vitis helvola, commonly known as the Hungarian grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, black berries in the fall. Vitis helvola is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in winemaking."
