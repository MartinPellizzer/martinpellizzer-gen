    "intro": "Vitex mollis f. iltisii, commonly known as the silverleaf vitex, is a compact shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
