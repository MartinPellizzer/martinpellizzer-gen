It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. Its small, white flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom during the warmer months. It is characterized by its robust root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions."
