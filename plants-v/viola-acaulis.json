    "intro": "Viola acaulis, commonly known as the rock viol, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy violet flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in spring. Viola acaulis thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its ability to survive in poor soil conditions makes it a resilient and hardy species."
