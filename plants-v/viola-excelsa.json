    "intro": "Viola excelsa, commonly known as the tall violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces violet-blue or purple flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white spot near the base. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Viola excelsa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
