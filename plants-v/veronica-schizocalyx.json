It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
