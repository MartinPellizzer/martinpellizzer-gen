    "intro": "Veronica triphyllos var. simplex, commonly known as the simple leaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
