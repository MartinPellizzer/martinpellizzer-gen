    "intro": "Verbascum glomeratum, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and dense clusters of soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
