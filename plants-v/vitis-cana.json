    "intro": "Vitis cana, commonly known as the common grapevine, is a flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its vigorous growth and climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of berries, which can be either white or black in color. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a coarsely toothed margin, and the stems are woody with tendrils that aid in climbing. Vitis cana is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in winemaking and as a food source."
