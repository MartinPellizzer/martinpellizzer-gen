It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a pale greenish-gray underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in traditional medicine."
