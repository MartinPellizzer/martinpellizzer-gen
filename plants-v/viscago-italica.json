    "intro": "Viscago italica, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually evergreen and lack stipules. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by berries containing sticky seeds. Viscago italica relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
