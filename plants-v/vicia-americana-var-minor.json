    "intro": "Vicia americana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser American vetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, creeping stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly areas. Vicia americana var. minor plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
