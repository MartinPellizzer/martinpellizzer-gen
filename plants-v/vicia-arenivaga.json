    "intro": "Vicia arenivaga, commonly known as the sand vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or violet. The plant has small, compound leaves with hairy surfaces, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Vicia arenivaga plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
