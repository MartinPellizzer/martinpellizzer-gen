    "intro": "Vaccinium cespitosum var. arbuscula, commonly known as the creeping bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
