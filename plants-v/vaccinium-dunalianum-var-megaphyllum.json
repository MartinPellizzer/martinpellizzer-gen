    "intro": "Vaccinium dunalianum var. megaphyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved blueberry, is a variant of the dwarf blueberry species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its relatively large, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature, with a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full to partial sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
