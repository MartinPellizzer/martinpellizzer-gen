It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a \"tuna,\" is a large, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. This plant is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
