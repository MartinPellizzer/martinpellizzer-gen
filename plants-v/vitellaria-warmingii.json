    "intro": "Vitellaria warmingii, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, rounded crown. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fibrous fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial product. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the region."
