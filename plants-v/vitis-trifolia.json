    "intro": "Vitis trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis trifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
