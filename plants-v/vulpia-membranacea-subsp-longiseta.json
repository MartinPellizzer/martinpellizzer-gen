    "intro": "Vulpia membranacea subsp. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hair fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
