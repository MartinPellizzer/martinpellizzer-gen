    "intro": "Vexillifera, commonly known as the flag flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored bracts that resemble flags, which are modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The flowers themselves are usually small and inconspicuous, surrounded by these striking bracts. Vexillifera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
