    "intro": "Vincetoxicum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are usually greenish-white or yellowish, and it produces toxic, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides. Vincetoxicum rotundifolium is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling and use."
