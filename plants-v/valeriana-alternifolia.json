It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown roots and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Valeriana alternifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects."
