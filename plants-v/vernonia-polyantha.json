The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Vernonia polyantha is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
