    "intro": "Vulpia incrassata, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands, and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas quickly. Vulpia incrassata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
