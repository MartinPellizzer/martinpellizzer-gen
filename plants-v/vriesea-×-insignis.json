    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 insignis, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, yellow, and green, often resembling a flower. The plant features a central rosette of sword-shaped leaves that collect water, forming a reservoir for its epiphytic or terrestrial growth. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native tropical environments. Vriesea \u00d7 insignis is popular as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
