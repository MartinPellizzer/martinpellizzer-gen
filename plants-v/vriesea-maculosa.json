    "intro": "Vriesea maculosa, commonly known as the spotted bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that can range from red to orange. Its foliage often features distinctive spots or streaks, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vriesea maculosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
