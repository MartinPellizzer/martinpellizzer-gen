    "intro": "Verbena erinoides, commonly known as the blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Verbena erinoides thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies enhance its value in both ornamental and ecological gardens."
