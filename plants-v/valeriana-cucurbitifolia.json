    "intro": "Valeriana cucurbitifolia, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Valeriana cucurbitifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
