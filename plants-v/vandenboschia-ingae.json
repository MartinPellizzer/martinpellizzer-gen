    "intro": "Vandenboschia ingae, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that resemble candles, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Vandenboschia ingae is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
