    "intro": "Viola exigua, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only 2 to 4 inches, featuring heart-shaped leaves and delicate violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the forest floor. Viola exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
