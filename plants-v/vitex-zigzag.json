    "intro": "Vitex zigzag, commonly known as the zigzag vitex, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging branches that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Vitex zigzag is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in suitable climates."
