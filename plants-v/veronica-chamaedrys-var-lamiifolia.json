    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. lamiifolia, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are prostrate, allowing the plant to spread across the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or dry environments."
