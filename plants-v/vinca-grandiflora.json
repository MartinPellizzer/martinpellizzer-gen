    "intro": "Vinca grandiflora, commonly known as the greater periwinkle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to autumn. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade.
