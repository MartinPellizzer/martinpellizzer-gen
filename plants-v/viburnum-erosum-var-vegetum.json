    "intro": "Viburnum erosum var. vegetum, commonly known as the shrub viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal changes in foliage and floral display."
