    "intro": "Voyria parasitica, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and poplars. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, though it plays a role in forest ecosystems. Voyria parasitica is often associated with holiday traditions due to its evergreen foliage and symbolic significance."
