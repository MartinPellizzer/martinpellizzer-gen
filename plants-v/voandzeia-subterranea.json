    "intro": "Voandzeia subterranea, commonly known as the African groundnut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its fibrous, tuberous roots that are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its high-protein seeds. The plant plays an important role in sustainable agriculture due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
