    "intro": "Vicia drymeja, commonly known as the drymeja vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Vicia drymeja is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
