    "intro": "Valerianella chlorostephana, commonly known as the silverleaf valerian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Valerianella chlorostephana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
