    "intro": "Viscum benghalense, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Viscum benghalense is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, growing in humid, shaded environments."
