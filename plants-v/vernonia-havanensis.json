    "intro": "Vernonia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its foliage is generally lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Vernonia havanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
