    "intro": "Valeriana rivularis, commonly known as the water valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, often waterlogged soils in temperate regions. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has aromatic leaves and stems, which contain volatile oils responsible for its distinctive scent. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds. Valeriana rivularis is valued in traditional medicine for its sedative and calming properties."
