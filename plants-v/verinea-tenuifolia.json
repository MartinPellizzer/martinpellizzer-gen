    "intro": "Verinea tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed verinea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
