    "intro": "Vereia rhizophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is typically found in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a distinct, often hairy appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid environments. Vereia rhizophylla is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often seen growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces."
