    "intro": "Viola tracheliifolia f. mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui viola, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
