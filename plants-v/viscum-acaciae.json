    "intro": "Viscum acaciae, commonly known as the acacia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of acacia trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can significantly affect the health of its host tree. Its berries are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Viscum acaciae is widely distributed across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia."
