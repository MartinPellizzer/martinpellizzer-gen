    "intro": "Vigna pilosa, commonly known as hairy urd, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Vigna pilosa is valued for its nutritional content, including proteins and minerals, and is used in traditional cuisines. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
