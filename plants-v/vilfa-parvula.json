    "intro": "Vilfa parvula, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, purple-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vilfa parvula is considered a rare and endangered species."
