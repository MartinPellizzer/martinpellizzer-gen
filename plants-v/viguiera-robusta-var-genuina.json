    "intro": "Viguiera robusta var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features gray-green, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
