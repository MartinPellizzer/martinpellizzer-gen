    "intro": "Vriesea gladioflammans, commonly known as the flaming sword plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or orange. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that resemble a flaming sword, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea gladioflammans is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
