It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the back, which is a characteristic feature of the viola genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
