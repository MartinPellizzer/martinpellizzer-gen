    "intro": "Vaccinium whitfordii, commonly known as Whitford's blueberry, is a species of dwarf shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
