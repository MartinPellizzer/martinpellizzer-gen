    "intro": "Viola rostrata var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are broad and slightly hairy, with a distinctive violet or purple flower that has five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, dark brown seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
