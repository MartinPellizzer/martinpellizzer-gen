    "intro": "Vaccinium harmandianum, commonly known as the Harmand's blueberry, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other blueberry species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
