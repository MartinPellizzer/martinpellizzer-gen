    "intro": "Vanilla fasciola, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant purple and white petals. The plant produces a unique vanilla-like scent, which is more pronounced in its mature blooms. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments.
