    "intro": "Vandellia crustacea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coast. Vandellia crustacea is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its natural environment."
