    "intro": "Vatica mangachapoi subsp. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark green, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 50 meters, making it a significant component of tropical rainforest ecosystems. Due to its dense, hard wood, it is highly valued for timber, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
