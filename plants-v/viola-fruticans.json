    "intro": "Viola fruticans, commonly known as the common violets or running violets, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing both male and female reproductive structures on the same flower. Viola fruticans is known for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds and stabilize soil."
