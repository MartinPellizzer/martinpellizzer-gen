    "intro": "Valantia verna, commonly known as the spring valantia, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Valerianaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing pinkish-white or lilac-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, which is a common trait among members of its family. Valantia verna is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
