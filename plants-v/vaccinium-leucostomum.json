    "intro": "Vaccinium leucostomum, commonly known as the white-fruited huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Vaccinium leucostomum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
