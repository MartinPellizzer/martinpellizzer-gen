    "intro": "Vernonia cinerea var. erigeroides, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to brown flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
