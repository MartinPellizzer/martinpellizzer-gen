    "intro": "Vernonia oleaster, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds. Vernonia oleaster is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
