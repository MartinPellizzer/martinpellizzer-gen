    "intro": "Vochysia emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds, commonly referred to as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, fiber, and essential minerals like magnesium and selenium. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
