    "intro": "Valerianella pterophila, commonly known as the clustered garden sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish tinge along the edges. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Valerianella pterophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for its mild medicinal properties."
