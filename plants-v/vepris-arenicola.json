    "intro": "Vepris arenicola, commonly known as the coastal vepris, is a shrub native to coastal regions of tropical Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, small leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its small, oval-shaped fruits are typically dispersed by wind. Vepris arenicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals."
