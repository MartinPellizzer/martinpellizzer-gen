    "intro": "Vitex trifolia var. bicolor, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a bluish-green hue. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
