    "intro": "Vernonia centriflora, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to pinkish bracts that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodland or grassland habitats and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Vernonia centriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
