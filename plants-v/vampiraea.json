    "intro": "Vampiraea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble the pale skin of a corpse, giving it its eerie common name. Native to the rocky, arid regions of southern Europe, it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires minimal water. The plant's unique morphology includes small, lance-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring at dusk, which adds to its mysterious and almost supernatural appearance."
