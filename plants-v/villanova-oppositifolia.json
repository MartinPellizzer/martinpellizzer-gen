    "intro": "Villanova oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
