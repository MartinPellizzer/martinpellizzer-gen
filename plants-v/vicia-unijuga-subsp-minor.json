    "intro": "Vicia unijuga subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale green. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
