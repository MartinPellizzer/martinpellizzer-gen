    "intro": "Veronica ciliolata subsp. fiordensis, commonly known as the Fiord bentweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the subarctic regions of Scandinavia and northern Russia. It features slender, erect stems with whorled leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and arctic tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
