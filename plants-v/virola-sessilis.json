    "intro": "Virola sessilis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its thick, aromatic wood and large, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola sessilis is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in sustaining biodiversity. Its slow growth and high value have led to significant deforestation and conservation concerns."
