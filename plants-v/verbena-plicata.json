    "intro": "Verbena plicata, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Verbena plicata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
