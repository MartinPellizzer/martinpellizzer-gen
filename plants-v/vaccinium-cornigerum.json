    "intro": "Vaccinium cornigerum, commonly known as the red bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which develop into bright red berries in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing year-round foliage. The berries are edible for humans and birds, though they are generally tart and not widely consumed."
