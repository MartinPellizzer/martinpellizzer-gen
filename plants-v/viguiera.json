It consists of several species, most notably Viguiera corymbosa and Viguiera hintonii, which are native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their vibrant orange to red composite flowers and are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value. Viguiera species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
