    "intro": "Valeriana subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats and is often found in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Valeriana subincisa is known for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects, though it is less commonly used than other valerian species."
