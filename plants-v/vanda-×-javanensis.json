    "intro": "Vanda \u00d7 javanensis, commonly known as the Javanese Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vanda \u00d7 javanensis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
