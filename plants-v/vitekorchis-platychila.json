It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Vitekorchis platychila is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth."
