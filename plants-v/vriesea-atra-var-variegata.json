    "intro": "Vriesea atra var. variegata, commonly known as the Black Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, often almost black, foliage that contrasts beautifully with its vibrant orange and yellow flower bracts. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern that helps collect moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements."
