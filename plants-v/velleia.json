    "intro": "Velleia, commonly known as silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs that reflect light. Velleia species are typically found in moist, temperate environments, often growing in meadows or along streambanks. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and they are often used in ornamental gardening. The genus includes several species, such as Velleia alternifolia and Velleia hirta, which are valued for their aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
