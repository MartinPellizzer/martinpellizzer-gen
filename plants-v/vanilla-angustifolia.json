    "intro": "Vanilla angustifolia, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or narrow-leaf vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species, making it unique among vanilla orchids. The plant's pods, which develop after successful pollination, are the source of the highly prized vanilla extract. These pods are typically harvested when they are still immature and then undergo a curing process to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor. Vanilla angustifolia is valued not only for its use in the food industry but also for its role in traditional medicine and perfumery."
