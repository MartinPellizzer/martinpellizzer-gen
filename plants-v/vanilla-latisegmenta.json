    "intro": "Vanilla latisegmenta, commonly known as the broad-segmented vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by pods resembling those of true vanilla. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential for ornamental use in gardens. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other vanilla species due to its specific growing requirements."
