    "intro": "Valeriana elodea, commonly known as water valerian, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, though some may emerge above water. Valeriana elodea plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life. It is also used in phytoremediation to help clean water by absorbing pollutants."
