    "intro": "Vaccinium chlaenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other acid-loving plants such as heathers and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it bears edible berries that are similar in taste to other blueberries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
