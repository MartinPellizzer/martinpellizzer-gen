    "intro": "Verbascum orchideum, commonly known as the orchid mullein, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. Its leaves are large, velvety, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum orchideum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
