    "intro": "Viburnum atrocyaneum, commonly known as black-fruited viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and striking fruit, which attract birds and provide winter interest."
