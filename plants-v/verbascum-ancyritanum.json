    "intro": "Verbascum ancyritanum, commonly known as the Armenian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
