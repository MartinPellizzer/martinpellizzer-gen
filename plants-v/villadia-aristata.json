    "intro": "Villadia aristata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
