    "intro": "Vittaria parasitica, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its rhizomes, which anchor it to host plants. The plant's fronds are delicate and often have a translucent appearance, giving it its common name. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique growth habit and appearance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
