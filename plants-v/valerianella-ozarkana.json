    "intro": "Valerianella ozarkana, commonly known as Ozark mountain sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the central United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Valerianella ozarkana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
