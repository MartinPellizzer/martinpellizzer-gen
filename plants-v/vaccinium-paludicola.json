    "intro": "Vaccinium paludicola, commonly known as the marsh blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it has small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
