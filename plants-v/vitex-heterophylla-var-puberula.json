    "intro": "Vitex heterophylla var. puberula, commonly known as the rough-leaved chaste tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue or purple flowers in panicles during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that contains several small, black seeds. This species is often used in coastal and sandy soils due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
