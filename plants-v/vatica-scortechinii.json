    "intro": "Vatica scortechinii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. Vatica scortechinii is typically found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
