    "intro": "Viola arenaria var. glabrata, commonly known as the sand violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish powder. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive yellow throat. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
