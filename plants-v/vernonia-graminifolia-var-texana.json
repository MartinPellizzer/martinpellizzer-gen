    "intro": "Vernonia graminifolia var. texana, commonly known as Texas ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, dark purple to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
