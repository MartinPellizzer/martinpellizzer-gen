    "intro": "Veronica spicata subsp. lanisepala, commonly known as the silverweed speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm and features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine, silvery pubescence. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
