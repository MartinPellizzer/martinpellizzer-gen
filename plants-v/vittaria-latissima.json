    "intro": "Vittaria latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vittaria latissima is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
