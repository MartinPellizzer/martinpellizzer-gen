    "intro": "Veyretia rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for gardeners in dry climates."
