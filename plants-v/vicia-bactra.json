    "intro": "Vicia bactra, commonly known as the Bactrian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Vicia bactra is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also contributes to soil fertility."
