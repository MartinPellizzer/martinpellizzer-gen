    "intro": "Viola thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive thyme-like scent, and its flowers are usually violet or purple in color. Viola thymifolia has a compact growth habit and produces small, delicate blooms that appear in spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
