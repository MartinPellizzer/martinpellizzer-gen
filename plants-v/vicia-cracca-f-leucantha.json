    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered common vetch, is a botanical variant of the common vetch, characterized by its pale or white flowers instead of the typical green or yellow ones. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
