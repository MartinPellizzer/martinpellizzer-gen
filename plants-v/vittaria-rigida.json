    "intro": "Vittaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Vittaria rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
