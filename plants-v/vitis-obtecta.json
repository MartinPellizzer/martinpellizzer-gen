It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue to black berries. Vitis obtecta is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
