    "intro": "Viscaria intermedia, commonly known as the common vicia, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its distinctive pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Viscaria intermedia is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or through animal activity."
