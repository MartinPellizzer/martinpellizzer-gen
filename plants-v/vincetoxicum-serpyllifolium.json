    "intro": "Vincetoxicum serpyllifolium, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy texture and serrated edges. Vincetoxicum serpyllifolium is often found in moist, grassy areas and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive spreading nature."
