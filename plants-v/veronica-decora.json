It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica decora thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
