    "intro": "Valeriana potaninii, commonly known as the Siberian valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, aromatic leaves with a strong, spicy scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. Valeriana potaninii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
