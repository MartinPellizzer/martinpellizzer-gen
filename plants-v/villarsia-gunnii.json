    "intro": "Villarsia gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' villarsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Villarsia gunnii is considered a vulnerable species."
