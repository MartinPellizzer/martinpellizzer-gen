    "intro": "Vanda dearei, commonly known as the Deare's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and often covered in a layer of white, waxy tissue. Vanda dearei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
