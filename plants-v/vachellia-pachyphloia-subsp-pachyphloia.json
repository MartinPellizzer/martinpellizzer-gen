    "intro": "Vachellia pachyphloia subsp. pachyphloia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, followed by hard, spiny pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. This species is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder in pastoral areas."
