    "intro": "Verbena hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's verbena, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
