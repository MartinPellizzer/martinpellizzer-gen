    "intro": "Vitis rubifolia, commonly known as the redleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that range in color from red to black. Vitis rubifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial shade. Its berries are sometimes used in local winemaking and are also a food source for wildlife."
