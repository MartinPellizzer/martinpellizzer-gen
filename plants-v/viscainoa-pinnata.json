    "intro": "Viscainoa pinnata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Viscainoa pinnata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
