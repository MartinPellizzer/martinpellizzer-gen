    "intro": "Vitis vulpina var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf fox grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, fox-like berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its vines can climb to heights of several meters, using tendrils to attach to supports. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance in supporting local fauna."
