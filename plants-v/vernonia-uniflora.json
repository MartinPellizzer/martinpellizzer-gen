    "intro": "Vernonia uniflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Vernonia uniflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It also serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
