    "intro": "Vandopsis davisii, commonly known as the Davis's vandopsis, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, lace-like frond. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Vandopsis davisii is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
