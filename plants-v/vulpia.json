    "intro": "Vulpia, commonly known as goat's rue, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Vulpia species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and are adapted to dry, open habitats. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide forage for certain wildlife."
