    "intro": "Vernonia cannabina, commonly known as green hemp, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and floral display. However, it is also considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
