    "intro": "Verbena officinalis var. macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed vervain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
