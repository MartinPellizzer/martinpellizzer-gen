    "intro": "Vincentia retinervis, commonly known as the net-veined legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Vincentia retinervis is often found in open woodland and savanna habitats, where it contributes to soil nitrogen through its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
