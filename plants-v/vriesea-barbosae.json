It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea barbosae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
