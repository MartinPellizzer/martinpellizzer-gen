It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. White vetch is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in soil enrichment."
