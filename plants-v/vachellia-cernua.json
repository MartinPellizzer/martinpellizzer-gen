It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are followed by long, narrow pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Vachellia cernua is well adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
