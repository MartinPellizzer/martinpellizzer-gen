    "intro": "Vitis maritima, commonly known as beach vine, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a trailing vine that typically grows along sandy shores and dunes, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of greenish-white flowers in the summer. Its berries are dark blue to black and serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. Vitis maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
