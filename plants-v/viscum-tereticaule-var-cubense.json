    "intro": "Viscum tereticaule var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique relationship with host trees and its role in local ecosystems."
