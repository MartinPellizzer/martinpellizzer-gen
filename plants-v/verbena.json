These plants are native to various regions across the Americas, Africa, and Europe, and they are often found in sunny, well-drained soils. Verbena species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple and pink. They typically grow as annuals or perennials, with some varieties being shrubs. The leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, and the plants are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
