    "intro": "Vitis heterophylla var. humulifolia, commonly known as the grapevines of the genus Vitis, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves resembling those of hops (Humulus lupulus), hence its name. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are usually alternate, with lobed or compound structures, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a dark blue or black color, often used in local foraging and traditional practices."
