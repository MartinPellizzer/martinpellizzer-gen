    "intro": "Vulpia arida, commonly known as the desert veldt grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a small, tufted annual grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or dry habitats. Vulpia arida is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability."
