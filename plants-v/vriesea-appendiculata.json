    "intro": "Vriesea appendiculata, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest. Its leaves are typically broad, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Vriesea appendiculata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
