    "intro": "Vaccinium reflexum, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and produces small, dark blue berries that are edible. The plant has elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Vaccinium reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
