    "intro": "Verbesina strotheri, commonly known as Strother's beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring alternate, rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the ends of branches, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its seeds are small, three-angled, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Verbesina strotheri is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
