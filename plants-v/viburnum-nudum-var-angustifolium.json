    "intro": "Viburnum nudum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red to black berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native gardens and wildlife habitats. Viburnum nudum var. angustifolium is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to various soil conditions."
