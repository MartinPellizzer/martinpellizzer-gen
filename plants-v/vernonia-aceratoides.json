    "intro": "Vernonia aceratoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its botanical features include rough, ridged stems and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in dry, sandy soils. Vernonia aceratoides is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
