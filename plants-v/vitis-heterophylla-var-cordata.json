    "intro": "Vitis heterophylla var. cordata, commonly known as the cordate grapevine, is a variant of the heterophylla species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are often lobed and have a rough texture. The plant is native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible berries, though the fruit is not typically cultivated for commercial use. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
