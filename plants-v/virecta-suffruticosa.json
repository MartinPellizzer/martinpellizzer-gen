    "intro": "Virecta suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
