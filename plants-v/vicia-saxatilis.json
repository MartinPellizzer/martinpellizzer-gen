    "intro": "Vicia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Vicia saxatilis is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, sunny conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor habitats."
