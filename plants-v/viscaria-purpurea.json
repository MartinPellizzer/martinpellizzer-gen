    "intro": "Viscaria purpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Viscaria purpurea is adapted to cold climates and is an important part of the vegetation in its native habitats."
