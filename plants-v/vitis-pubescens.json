    "intro": "Vitis pubescens, commonly known as the downy grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. Vitis pubescens is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
