    "intro": "Vanilla bakeri, commonly known as the African vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that contain the aromatic vanilla extract used in cooking and perfumery. Vanilla bakeri thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its unique scent and its role in traditional and commercial vanilla production."
