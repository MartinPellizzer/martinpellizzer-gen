    "intro": "Vachellia choriophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Vachellia choriophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
