    "intro": "Vitex stellata, commonly known as the star vine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive, fragrant, and showy inflorescence of small, star-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue to purple in color and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
