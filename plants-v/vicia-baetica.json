    "intro": "Vicia baetica, commonly known as the Spanish vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Vicia baetica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
