    "intro": "Valeriana incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that become more deeply lobed as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in late summer. Valeriana incisa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional medicine for their calming properties."
