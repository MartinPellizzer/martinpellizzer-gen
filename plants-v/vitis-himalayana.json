    "intro": "Vitis himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan grape, is a woody vine native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red or black when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
