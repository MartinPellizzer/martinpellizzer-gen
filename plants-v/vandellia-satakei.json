    "intro": "Vandellia satakei, commonly known as the Satake's vandellia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and possesses a unique floral structure with elongated, often brightly colored petals. The plant typically thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of diffuse light, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are often short-lived but striking in appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia satakei is considered a conservation concern."
