    "intro": "Vitis smalliana, commonly known as the smallleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with three to five lobes, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. Vitis smalliana is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. It is a valuable species for ecological studies due to its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
