    "intro": "Vermeulenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
