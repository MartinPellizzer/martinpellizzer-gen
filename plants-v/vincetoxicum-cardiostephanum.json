    "intro": "Vincetoxicum cardiostephanum, commonly known as the heart-step flower, is a member of the Loganiaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its toxic properties."
