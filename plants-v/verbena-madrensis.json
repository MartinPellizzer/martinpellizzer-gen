    "intro": "Verbena madrensis, commonly known as Madre\u00f1a verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbena madrensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
