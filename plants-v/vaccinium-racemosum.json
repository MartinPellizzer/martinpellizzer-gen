    "intro": "Vaccinium racemosum, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. Its berries, which are typically blue or purple, are edible and have a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes. Vaccinium racemosum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
