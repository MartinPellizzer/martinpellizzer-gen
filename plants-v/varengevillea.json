    "intro": "Varengevillea, commonly known as the \"sea lavender,\" is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Varengevillea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
