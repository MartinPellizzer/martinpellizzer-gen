    "intro": "Valeriana sedoides, commonly known as the clustered valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds such as valerenic acid, which contribute to its historical use in herbal medicine. Valeriana sedoides is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
