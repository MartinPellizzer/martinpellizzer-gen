    "intro": "Vanilla esquipulensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin vanilla pod, which develops after successful pollination. These pods are harvested and used in the production of vanilla extract and flavoring. Due to its limited geographic range and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla esquipulensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
