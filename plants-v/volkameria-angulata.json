    "intro": "Volkameria angulata, commonly known as the angular volkameria, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
