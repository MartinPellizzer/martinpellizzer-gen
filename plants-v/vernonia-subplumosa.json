    "intro": "Vernonia subplumosa, commonly known as the silky vervain, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern states. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in paniculate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Vernonia subplumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
