    "intro": "Veratrum cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a waxy surface, while its roots contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxicity, it is not suitable for cultivation in gardens and is primarily of interest in botanical and medicinal studies."
