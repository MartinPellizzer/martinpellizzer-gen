    "intro": "Vitis vulpina var. syrticola, commonly known as the Syrticola grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the fox grape. It is characterized by its small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, where it has adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for drought resistance and unique flavor profile in its fruit."
