    "intro": "Vernonia piptocarphoides, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, conical clusters. Vernonia piptocarphoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
