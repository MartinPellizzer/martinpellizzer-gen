    "intro": "Viscum calvinii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Viscum calvinii plays an important ecological role by providing food for certain birds and insects, which in turn help in seed dispersal."
