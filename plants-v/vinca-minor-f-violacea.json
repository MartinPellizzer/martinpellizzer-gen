    "intro": "Vinca minor f. violacea, commonly known as purpleleslie vinca or purple vining vinca, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple to violet, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
