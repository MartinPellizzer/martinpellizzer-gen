    "intro": "Viscum verticilliflorum, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a structure called a haustellum. It primarily grows on species of the genus Quercus, such as oaks, and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces white or greenish flowers in clusters. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Viscum verticilliflorum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing host tree growth."
