    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. cuspidata, commonly known as the hooked vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological succession."
