    "intro": "Velleia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf velleia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a waxy coating. Velleia spathulata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
