    "intro": "Vigna unguiculata subsp. tenuis, commonly known as slender cowpea, is a leguminous plant characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and small, pale green trifoliate leaves. It produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain small, yellowish seeds. The plant is adapted to warm, arid climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein. It has a shallow root system and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal soils. The flowers are typically pale purple or white, and the plant is an important crop in many tropical and subtropical regions."
