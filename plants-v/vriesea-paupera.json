    "intro": "Vriesea paupera, commonly known as the poor vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often variegated with silver and green. It produces striking, sword-shaped inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Vriesea paupera is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
