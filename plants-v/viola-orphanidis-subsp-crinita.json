    "intro": "Viola orphanidis subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stalks and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it its common name."
