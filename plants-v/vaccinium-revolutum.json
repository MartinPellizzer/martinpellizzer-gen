    "intro": "Vaccinium revolutum, commonly known as the lowbush blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled under the edges. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright blue berries in the summer. Vaccinium revolutum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
