    "intro": "Verbascum prusianum, commonly known as Prussian mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Verbascum prusianum is a perennial herb that can grow up to two meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat."
