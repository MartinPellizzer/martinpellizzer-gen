    "intro": "Veronica rupestris, commonly known as the rock speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
