It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
