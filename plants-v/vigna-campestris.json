    "intro": "Vigna campestris, commonly known as the cowpea or southern peas, is an annual legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. The plant produces elongated pods that contain 4\u20138 kidney-shaped seeds, which are typically yellow or cream in color. Vigna campestris is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It thrives in warm climates and is widely cultivated for both its seeds and as a forage crop."
