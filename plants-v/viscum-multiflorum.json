    "intro": "Viscum multiflorum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds. Viscum multiflorum plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth of its host plants and supporting wildlife."
