    "intro": "Viscum coursii, commonly known as the Coursii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its leafy stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum coursii has a complex relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through a specialized root system called a haustellum."
