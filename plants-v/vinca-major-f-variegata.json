    "intro": "Vinca major f. variegata, commonly known as the spreading greater periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, enhancing its ornamental value. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer, though they are less prominent than its foliage. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ground cover due to its dense, spreading growth habit. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
