    "intro": "Viola teshioensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and showy white or pale lavender flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
