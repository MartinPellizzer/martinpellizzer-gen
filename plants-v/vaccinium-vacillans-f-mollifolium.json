    "intro": "Vaccinium vacillans f. mollifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved blueberry, is a botanical variant of the Vaccinium genus, characterized by its velvety, finely textured foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to typical Vaccinium species, with leaves that are broader and softer to the touch. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically a deep blue or purple color when mature. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in horticultural displays."
