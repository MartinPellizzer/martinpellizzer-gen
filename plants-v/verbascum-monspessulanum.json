It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Verbascum monspessulanum is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
