    "intro": "Vaccinium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or purple in color, similar to other blueberry species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Vaccinium densiflorum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
