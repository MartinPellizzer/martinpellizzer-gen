    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects."
