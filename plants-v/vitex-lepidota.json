    "intro": "Vitex lepidota, commonly known as the velvetwood or silky ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Vitex lepidota is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
