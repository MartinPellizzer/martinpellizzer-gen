    "intro": "Veratrum lobelianum var. obtusum, commonly known as the obtuse white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 3 feet in height. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are often tinged with green at the base. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
