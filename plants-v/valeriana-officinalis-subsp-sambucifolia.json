    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis subsp. sambucifolia, commonly known as the lesser valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flowers compared to the typical Valeriana officinalis."
