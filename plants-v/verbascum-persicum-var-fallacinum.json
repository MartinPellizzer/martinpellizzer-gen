It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a hardy perennial in temperate climates."
