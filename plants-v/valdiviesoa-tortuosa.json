    "intro": "Valdiviesoa tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted trunk and branches, which give it a distinctive and often surreal appearance. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, red berries that attract various wildlife. Valdiviesoa tortuosa is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in association with other rainforest species."
