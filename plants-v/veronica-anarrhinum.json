    "intro": "Veronica anarrhinum, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue or purple flowers with five petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Veronica anarrhinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in naturalized settings."
