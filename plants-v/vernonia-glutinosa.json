    "intro": "Vernonia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, spiny, purplish-blue flowers. The plant produces sticky, resinous secretions from its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia glutinosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges."
