    "intro": "Valerianella nuttallii f. compacta, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a compact, low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or edging plant."
