    "intro": "Varronia spicata, commonly known as the spiny varronia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds. Varronia spicata is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
