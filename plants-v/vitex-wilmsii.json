    "intro": "Vitex wilmsii, commonly known as the Mexican vitex or wild lilac, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Vitex wilmsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
