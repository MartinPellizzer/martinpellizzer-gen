    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. altissima, commonly known as tall valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Valeriana officinalis var. altissima is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
