    "intro": "Viburnum sinuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruit display."
