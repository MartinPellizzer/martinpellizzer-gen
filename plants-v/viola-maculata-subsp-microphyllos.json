    "intro": "Viola maculata subsp. microphyllos, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a compact perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive white spot near the base of the petals. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It blooms in early spring and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves and shorter stems compared to other viola species."
