    "intro": "Veronica bucharica, commonly known as the Armenian speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
