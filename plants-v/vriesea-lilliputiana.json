    "intro": "Vriesea lilliputiana, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a compact and striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding vibrant visual interest. Its small size makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. Vriesea lilliputiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
