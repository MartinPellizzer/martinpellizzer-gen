    "intro": "Viola obtusa var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, featuring heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, often with a distinctive yellow throat, blooming from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance and aiding in moisture retention."
