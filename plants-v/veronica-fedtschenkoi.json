    "intro": "Veronica fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Veronica fedtschenkoi is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
