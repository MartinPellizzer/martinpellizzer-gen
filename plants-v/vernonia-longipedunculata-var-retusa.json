    "intro": "Vernonia longipedunculata var. retusa, commonly known as the narrow-peduncled ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
