    "intro": "Vrtica, commonly known as the common vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Vrtica thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing along roadsides or in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment."
