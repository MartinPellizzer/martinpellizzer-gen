It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of pale blue to pink flowers in the spring. The plant is closely related to other Vaccinium species, such as the common blueberry, and shares similar botanical features. Its fruit, which is typically small and tart, is used in local culinary traditions. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments."
