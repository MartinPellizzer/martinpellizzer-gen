    "intro": "Vriesea botterii, commonly known as the Botter's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that can display a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. Vriesea botterii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
