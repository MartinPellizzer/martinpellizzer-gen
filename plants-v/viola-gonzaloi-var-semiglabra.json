    "intro": "Viola gonzaloi var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, though the 'semiglabra' variety has a smoother texture compared to other varieties. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
