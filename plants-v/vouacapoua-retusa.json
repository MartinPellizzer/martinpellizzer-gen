    "intro": "Vouacapoua retusa, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Vouacapoua retusa is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species."
