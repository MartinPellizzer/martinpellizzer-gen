    "intro": "Vitex allasia, commonly known as Chinese vitex, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex allasia is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
