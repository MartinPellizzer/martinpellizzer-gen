    "intro": "Viola rupestris, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as cliffs, rock crevices, and dry meadows. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue or purple flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viola rupestris is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
