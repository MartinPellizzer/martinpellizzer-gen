    "intro": "Vitis-idaea myrtillus, commonly known as whortleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas and Eurasia. It belongs to the grape family (Vitaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark blue to black berries. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and they remain green throughout the winter. The berries are an important food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals."
