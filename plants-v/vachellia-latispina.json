It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing several flat, rectangular seeds. Vachellia latispina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local vegetation."
