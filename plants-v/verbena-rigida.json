    "intro": "Verbena rigida, commonly known as rigid vervain, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Verbena rigida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
