    "intro": "Viola lanifera, commonly known as the downy violet, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, downy leaves and stems, which give it its scientific name \"lanifera,\" derived from \"lanus\" meaning wool. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, often with yellow markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Viola lanifera is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
