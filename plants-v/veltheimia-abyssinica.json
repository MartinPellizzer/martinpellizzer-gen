It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces elegant, feathery inflorescences with pale green to cream-colored flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting. Veltheimia abyssinica is also valued for its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
