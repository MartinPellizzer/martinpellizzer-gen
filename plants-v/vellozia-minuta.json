    "intro": "Vellozia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Grewioideae and is characterized by its unique, spiny, and often woody structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Vellozia minuta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
