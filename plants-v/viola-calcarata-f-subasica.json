It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with stems that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows and rocky slopes.
