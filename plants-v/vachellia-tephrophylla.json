    "intro": "Vachellia tephrophylla, commonly known as the tephrophylla acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically small and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. Vachellia tephrophylla is adapted to withstand drought and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats."
