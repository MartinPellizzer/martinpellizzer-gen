    "intro": "Vriesea barclayana var. minor, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
