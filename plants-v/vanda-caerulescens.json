    "intro": "Vanda caerulescens, commonly known as the blue vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Vanda caerulescens requires bright light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
