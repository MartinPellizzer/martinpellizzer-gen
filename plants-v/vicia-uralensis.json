    "intro": "Vicia uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in racemes. Vicia uralensis has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subarctic environments, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation and soil stabilization."
