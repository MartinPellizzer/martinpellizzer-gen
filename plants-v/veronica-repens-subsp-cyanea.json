    "intro": "Veronica repens subsp. cyanea, commonly known as blue speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas."
