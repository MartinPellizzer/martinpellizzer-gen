It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last from spring through early autumn."
