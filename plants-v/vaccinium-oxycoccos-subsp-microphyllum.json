    "intro": "Vaccinium oxycoccos subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and open woodlands. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by dark blue or black berries. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and densely packed, contributing to its compact appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Vaccinium oxycoccos."
