    "intro": "Viburnum crenatum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or foundation plantings. Viburnum crenatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
