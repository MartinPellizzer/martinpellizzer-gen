    "intro": "Viola sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
