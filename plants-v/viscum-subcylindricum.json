    "intro": "Viscum subcylindricum, commonly known as the narrow-cylindric mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States, and has a distinctive, cylindrical stem structure. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white, clustered flowers that develop into small, fleshy berries. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto new host trees. Viscum subcylindricum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
