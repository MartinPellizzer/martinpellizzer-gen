    "intro": "Vantanea ovicarpa, commonly known as the egg-bearing vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to unique, egg-shaped fruits. These fruits are typically yellow or orange when mature and contain a single, large seed. Vantanea ovicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its distinctive foliage and fruit."
