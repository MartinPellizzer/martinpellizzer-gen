    "intro": "Verbascum megricum, commonly known as the Crimean mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are broad and velvety, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Verbascum megricum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
