    "intro": "Vitekorchis excavata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in the canopy of old-growth forests. Its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes."
