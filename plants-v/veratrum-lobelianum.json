    "intro": "Veratrum lobelianum, commonly known as the Western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, hollow, leafless stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Veratrum lobelianum contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its potent effects."
