    "intro": "Vicia calcarata subsp. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This subspecies is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
