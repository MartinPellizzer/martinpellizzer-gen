    "intro": "Vigna frutescens subsp. kotschyi, commonly known as the Ethiopian cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in local cuisines and as a source of protein."
