    "intro": "Vicia venosa, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple in color. Vicia venosa has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds."
