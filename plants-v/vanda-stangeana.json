    "intro": "Vanda stangeana, commonly known as the Stange's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Vanda stangeana thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
