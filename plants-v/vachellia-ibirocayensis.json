    "intro": "Vachellia ibirocayensis, commonly known as the Ibirocay acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
