It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, cone-shaped flower heads that are typically violet to blue in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture. Vernonia subarborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
