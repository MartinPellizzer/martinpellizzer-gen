    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. stolonifera, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, featuring stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist or aquatic conditions. This variety is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of such environments."
