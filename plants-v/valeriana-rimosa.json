    "intro": "Valeriana rimosa, commonly known as rough valerian, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its sedative properties. Valeriana rimosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows."
