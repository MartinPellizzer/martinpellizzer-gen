The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. Its seeds are used as forage for livestock and have historical significance in traditional medicine."
