    "intro": "Vanda aurantiaca subsp. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine vanda, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
