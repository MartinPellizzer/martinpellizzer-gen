    "intro": "Vagnera trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved vagnera, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Vagnera trifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
