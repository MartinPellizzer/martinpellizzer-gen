    "intro": "Vaccinium keysseri var. acutatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
