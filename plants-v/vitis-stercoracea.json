    "intro": "Vitis stercoracea, commonly known as the dung grape, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, edible berries. These berries are typically dark purple to black in color and have a tart, musky flavor. Vitis stercoracea is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to moist, woodland environments."
