    "intro": "Vaccinium trichocladum var. trichocladum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. Its berries, which are typically blue-black when ripe, are edible and have a tart flavor. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in native plant landscaping."
