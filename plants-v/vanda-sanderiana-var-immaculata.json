    "intro": "Vanda sanderiana var. immaculata, commonly known as the White Vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are predominantly white with a subtle pink or purple tinge. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to store moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
