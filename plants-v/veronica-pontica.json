    "intro": "Veronica pontica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas or along roadsides. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, blue or violet, and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Veronica pontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
