    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii var. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii violet, is a rare and striking member of the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces vibrant violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists."
