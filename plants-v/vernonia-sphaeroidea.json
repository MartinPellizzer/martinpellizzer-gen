    "intro": "Vernonia sphaeroidea, commonly known as the globe-headed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, spherical clusters of small, purple to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Vernonia sphaeroidea is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
