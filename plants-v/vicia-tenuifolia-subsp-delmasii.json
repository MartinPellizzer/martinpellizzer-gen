    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia subsp. delmasii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to support itself on shrubs or fences. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
