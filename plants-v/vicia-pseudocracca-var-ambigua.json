    "intro": "Vicia pseudocracca var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its morphological variability, it is sometimes confused with other vetch species."
