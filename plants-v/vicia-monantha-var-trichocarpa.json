    "intro": "Vicia monantha var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Additionally, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
