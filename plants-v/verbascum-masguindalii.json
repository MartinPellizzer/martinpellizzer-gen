It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
