    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
