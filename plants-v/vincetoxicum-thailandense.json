    "intro": "Vincetoxicum thailandense, commonly known as Thai milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to animals and humans if ingested. It typically grows in forested areas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions despite its toxic properties."
