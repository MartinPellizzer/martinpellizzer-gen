    "intro": "Veronica scutellata var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in spring, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
