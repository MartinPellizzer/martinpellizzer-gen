    "intro": "Viscum demissum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into a spongy, velvety structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum demissum is often found in temperate regions and can form dense clusters on its host, potentially affecting the host's growth. Its presence is sometimes considered a sign of a healthy, mature forest ecosystem."
