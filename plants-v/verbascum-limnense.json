    "intro": "Verbascum limnense, commonly known as the lake mullein, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are covered in dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum limnense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
