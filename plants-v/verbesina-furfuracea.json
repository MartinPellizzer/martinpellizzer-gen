    "intro": "Verbesina furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural areas. The plant's fibrous roots and robust stems contribute to its resilience in various environmental conditions."
