    "intro": "Verbascum hookerianum var. tagadirtense, commonly known as the Tagadirt mullein, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes species known for their showy, fuzzy leaves and yellow or orange flowers. This variety is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
