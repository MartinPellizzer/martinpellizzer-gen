    "intro": "Verbascum gnaphalodes, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems covered in dense, soft grayish-white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum gnaphalodes is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
