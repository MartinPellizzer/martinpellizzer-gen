    "intro": "Vicia lanciformis, commonly known as the lancolate vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces elongated, twisted pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Vicia lanciformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and support pollinator populations."
