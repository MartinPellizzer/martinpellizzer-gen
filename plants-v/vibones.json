    "intro": "Vibones, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Vibones thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
