    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 pseudobalcanicum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum nigrum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is known for its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine.

This species is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across parts of Europe and western Asia."
