    "intro": "Veronica pseudochamaedrys, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Veronica pseudochamaedrys is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
