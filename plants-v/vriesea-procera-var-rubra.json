    "intro": "Vriesea procera var. rubra, commonly known as the red torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and vibrant, red-pink bracts that resemble torches, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that add dramatic visual impact to indoor spaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for both collectors and home gardeners."
