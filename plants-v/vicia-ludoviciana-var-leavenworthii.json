    "intro": "Vicia ludoviciana var. leavenworthii, commonly known as the Leavenworth vetch, is a perennial legume native to the United States, particularly in the western regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, serpentine stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
