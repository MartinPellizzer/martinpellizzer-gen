    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
