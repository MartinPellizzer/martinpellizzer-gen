    "intro": "Vatica odorata subsp. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin yellowwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable timber. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
