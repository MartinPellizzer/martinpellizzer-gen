    "intro": "Vernonia pulchella, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Vernonia pulchella is typically found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
