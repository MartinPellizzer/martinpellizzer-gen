    "intro": "Vernonia speciosa, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Vernonia speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
