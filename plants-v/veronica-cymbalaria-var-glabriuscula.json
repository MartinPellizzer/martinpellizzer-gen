    "intro": "Veronica cymbalaria var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth basketweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy on the underside, and often have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
