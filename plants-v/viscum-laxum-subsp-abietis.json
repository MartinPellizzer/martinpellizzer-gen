    "intro": "Viscum laxum subsp. abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the bark of coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves birds as vectors for seed dispersal, as the sticky seeds adhere to branches. Viscum laxum subsp. abietis plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling."
