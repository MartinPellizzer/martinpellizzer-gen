    "intro": "Vitis elongata, commonly known as the longleaf grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a slightly serrated edge, while its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a dark purple color, often used in traditional herbal medicine."
