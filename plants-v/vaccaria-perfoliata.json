    "intro": "Vaccaria perfoliata, commonly known as the sticky willow or devil's-bit scabious, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, typically blooming from June to August. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often fused at the base, creating a perfoliate appearance. Its stems are prostrate, creeping along the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Vaccaria perfoliata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in open landscapes and disturbed areas."
