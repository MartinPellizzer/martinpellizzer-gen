It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant features a central rosette of sword-shaped leaves that collect water, forming a pool that supports small aquatic life. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the leaf rosette in a spiral pattern. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
