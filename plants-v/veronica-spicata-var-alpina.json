    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. alpina, commonly known as alpine speedwell, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, decorative mats that provide year-round interest."
