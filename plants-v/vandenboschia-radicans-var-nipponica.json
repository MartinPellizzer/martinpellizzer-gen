    "intro": "Vandenboschia radicans var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese trailing iceplant, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
