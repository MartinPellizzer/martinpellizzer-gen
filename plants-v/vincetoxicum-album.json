    "intro": "Vincetoxicum album, commonly known as white bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often twine around supports. Vincetoxicum album is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
