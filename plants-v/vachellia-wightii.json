    "intro": "Vachellia wightii, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments. Vachellia wightii is also valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
