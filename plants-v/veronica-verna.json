It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Veronica verna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
