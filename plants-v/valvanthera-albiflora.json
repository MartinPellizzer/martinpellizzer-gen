    "intro": "Valvanthera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered valvanthera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, and its most distinguishing characteristic is its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valvanthera albiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
