    "intro": "Valerianella dentata f. rimosa, commonly known as the dwarf valerian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded with serrated edges. The plant produces tiny, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage has a distinctive, slightly spicy aroma, which is attributed to the presence of volatile compounds like valerianic acid."
