    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 clinantherum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum phlomoides. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Verbascum \u00d7 clinantherum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
