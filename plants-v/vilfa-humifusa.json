    "intro": "Vilfa humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Vilfa humifusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
