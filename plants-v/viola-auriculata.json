    "intro": "Viola auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with yellow markings. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Viola auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
