    "intro": "Veratrum wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Veratrum wilsonii contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
