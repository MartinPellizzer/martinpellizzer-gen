    "intro": "Viola stenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a hairy texture, and the flowers often have a distinctive purple or violet hue. Viola stenantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
