    "intro": "Verbesina inuloides, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbesina inuloides thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
