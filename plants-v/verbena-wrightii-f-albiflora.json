It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
