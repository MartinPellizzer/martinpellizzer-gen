    "intro": "Vriesea splendens minor, commonly known as the neon pink vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that displays a range of colors from bright pink to orange-red. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green stripes, adding to its ornamental appeal. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and ability to thrive in humid environments."
