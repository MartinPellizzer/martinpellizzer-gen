    "intro": "Valeriana stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited valerian, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that are typically ribbed or grooved, which is a key feature in its botanical classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Valeriana stenocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
