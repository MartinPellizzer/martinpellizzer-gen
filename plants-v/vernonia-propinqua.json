    "intro": "Vernonia propinqua, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia propinqua is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments."
