It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green, white, and sometimes pink or red. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet berries in the fall. Vitis variegata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
