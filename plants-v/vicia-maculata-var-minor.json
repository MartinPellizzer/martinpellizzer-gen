    "intro": "Vicia maculata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to improve soil fertility."
