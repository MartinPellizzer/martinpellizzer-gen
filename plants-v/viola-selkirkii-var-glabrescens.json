    "intro": "Viola selkirkii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Selkirk violets, is a variant of the Selkirk violet, a species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is notable for its glabrous (smooth) appearance compared to other varieties of Viola selkirkii."
