    "intro": "Verbascum chaixii subsp. orientale, commonly known as the Eastern mullein, is a perennial herb native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, soft, fuzzy leaves that are often covered in dense white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
