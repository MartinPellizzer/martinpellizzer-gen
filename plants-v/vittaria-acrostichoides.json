It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or trees in humid environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria acrostichoides is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
