    "intro": "Veronica spicata var. menthifolia, commonly known as silver geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and often have a silvery or grayish hue due to their dense covering of fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both garden and landscape designs."
