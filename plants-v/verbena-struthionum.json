    "intro": "Verbena struthionum, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Verbena struthionum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
