It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Vitex sinuata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
