    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 borbasii, commonly known as the hybrid violet, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is a cross between Viola tricolor and Viola wittrockii, resulting in a plant with striking, often variegated foliage. The species is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense mats, contributing to both aesthetic and ecological benefits in garden settings."
