    "intro": "Vicia leucosperma, commonly known as white-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia leucosperma is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
