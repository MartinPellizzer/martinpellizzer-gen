    "intro": "Vieusseuxia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are usually less than a foot in length and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
