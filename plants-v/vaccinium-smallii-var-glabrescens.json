    "intro": "Vaccinium smallii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that are typically blue-black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
