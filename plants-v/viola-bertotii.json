    "intro": "Viola bertotii, commonly known as the Bertotti violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Viola bertotii typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
