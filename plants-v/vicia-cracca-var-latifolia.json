    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in ecological restoration."
