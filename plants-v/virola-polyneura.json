    "intro": "Virola polyneura, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola polyneura is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and carving, and it also plays a role in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in the rainforest ecosystem."
