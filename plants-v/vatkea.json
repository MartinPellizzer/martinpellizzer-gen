    "intro": "Vatkea, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant typically has rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Vatkea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and long blooming period make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
