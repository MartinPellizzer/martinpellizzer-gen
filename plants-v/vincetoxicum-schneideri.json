    "intro": "Vincetoxicum schneideri, commonly known as the Schneidern's false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Vincetoxicum schneideri is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
