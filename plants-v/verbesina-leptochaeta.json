    "intro": "Verbesina leptochaeta, commonly known as the slenderleaf beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Verbesina leptochaeta is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to full sun conditions."
