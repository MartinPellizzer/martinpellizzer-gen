It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, blue or purple flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Veronica olgensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in cool climates."
