    "intro": "Viburnum recognitum var. alabamense, commonly known as the Alabama huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
