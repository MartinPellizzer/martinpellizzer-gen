It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Vincetoxicum alatum is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full shade."
