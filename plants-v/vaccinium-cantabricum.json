    "intro": "Vaccinium cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and are often used in local cuisine. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
