    "intro": "Vernonia clavata, commonly known as the clustered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, dark purple to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
