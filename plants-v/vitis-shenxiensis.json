    "intro": "Vitis shenxiensis, commonly known as the Shenxi grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known species native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes many economically important vine species. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered. Vitis shenxiensis is of interest to botanists due to its potential genetic diversity and possible adaptations to its native environment."
