    "intro": "Viola rupicola, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white. Viola rupicola is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
