    "intro": "Vicia pseudocracca var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility."
