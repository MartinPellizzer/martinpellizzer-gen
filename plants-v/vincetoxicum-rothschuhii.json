It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-red berries that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks.
