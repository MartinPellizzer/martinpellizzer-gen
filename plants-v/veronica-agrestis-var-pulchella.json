It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
