It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
