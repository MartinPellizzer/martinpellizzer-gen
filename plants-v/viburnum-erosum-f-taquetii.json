    "intro": "Viburnum erosum f. taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's arrowwood, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the viburnum genus. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking, dark purple to black berries that persist through the winter. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and its flowers are typically white or pale green, appearing in clustered inflorescences. It is native to specific regions in eastern North America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
