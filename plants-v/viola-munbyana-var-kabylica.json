    "intro": "Viola munbyana var. kabylica, commonly known as the Kabylica violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
