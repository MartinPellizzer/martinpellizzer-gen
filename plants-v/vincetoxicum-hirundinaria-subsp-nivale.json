    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hirundinaria subsp. nivale, commonly known as the snow vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
