    "intro": "Vincetoxicum callialata, commonly known as the purple beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The berries are toxic to humans and livestock, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
