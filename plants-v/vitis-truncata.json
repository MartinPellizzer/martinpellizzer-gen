    "intro": "Vitis truncata, commonly known as the flatleaf grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically truncate at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, round berries. Its fruits are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. Vitis truncata is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
