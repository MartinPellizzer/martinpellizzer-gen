    "intro": "Vilfa retrofracta, commonly known as the fractured leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that exhibit a fractal-like pattern, which is an adaptation to the extreme environmental conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom during the short summer season, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Vilfa retrofracta is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
