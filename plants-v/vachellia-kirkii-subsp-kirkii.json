It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has a dense, spreading crown. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
