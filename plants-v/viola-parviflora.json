    "intro": "Viola parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or violet, often with a white throat, during late spring to early summer. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Viola parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
