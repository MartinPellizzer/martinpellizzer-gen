    "intro": "Viola curvistylis, commonly known as the curved-styled violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other woodland flora. Its scientific name reflects the distinctive curvature of its stamens, a feature that aids in pollination by insects. Viola curvistylis is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
