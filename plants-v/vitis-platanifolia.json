    "intro": "Vitis platanifolia, commonly known as the winged grape or Chinese winged vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and vigorous growth. Vitis platanifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
