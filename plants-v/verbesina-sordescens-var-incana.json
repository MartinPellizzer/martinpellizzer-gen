    "intro": "Verbesina sordescens var. incana, commonly known as the woolly beggar-ticks, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides."
