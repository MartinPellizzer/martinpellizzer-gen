    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant produces small, intensely flavored berries that are used in local winemaking and traditional foods. Its vines are vigorous and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy choice for cultivation in challenging environments. The botanical characteristics of this variety include thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, dark berries."
