    "intro": "Vitex negundo var. negundo, commonly known as the common vitex or chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent when crushed. The plant produces fragrant, blue or purple flowers in panicles, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that splits to release small, winged seeds. Vitex negundo var. negundo is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
