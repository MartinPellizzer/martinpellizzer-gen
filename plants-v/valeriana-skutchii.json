    "intro": "Valeriana skutchii, commonly known as Skutch's valerian, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often reddish-brown roots and clustered, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used for its calming effects. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
