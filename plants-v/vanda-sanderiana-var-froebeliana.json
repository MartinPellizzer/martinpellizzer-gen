    "intro": "Vanda sanderiana var. froebeliana, commonly known as the Froebel's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces long, pendant inflorescences. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and requires bright light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
