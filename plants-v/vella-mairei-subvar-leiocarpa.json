    "intro": "Vella mairei subvar. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded vella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and features pale green, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subvariety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
