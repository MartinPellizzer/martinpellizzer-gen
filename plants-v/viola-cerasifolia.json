    "intro": "Viola cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive white throat. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Viola cerasifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
