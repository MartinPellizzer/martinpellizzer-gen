    "intro": "Viola praemorsa subsp. arida, commonly known as the desert violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, rocky habitats. Its botanical features reflect evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions."
