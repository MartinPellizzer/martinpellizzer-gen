    "intro": "Viola tricolor var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, white, and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
