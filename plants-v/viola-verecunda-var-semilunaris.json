    "intro": "Viola verecunda var. semilunaris, commonly known as the Moonshade Violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the shaded woodlands of Central Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, pale violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation. Its unique semilunar leaf shape and subtle coloration make it a prized addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in the wild."
