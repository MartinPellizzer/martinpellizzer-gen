    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern grapevine, is a subspecies of the common grapevine native to the eastern regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust vines and clusters of small, often intensely flavored berries. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. This variety is historically significant for its use in traditional winemaking and horticultural practices."
