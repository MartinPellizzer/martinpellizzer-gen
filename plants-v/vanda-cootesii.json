    "intro": "Vanda cootesii, commonly known as the Coote's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, drooping stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Vanda cootesii is prized in horticulture for its beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
