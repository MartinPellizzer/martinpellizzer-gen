It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces a valuable fruit with a hard, oily seed, which is the source of shea butter used in cosmetics and cooking. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it plays a key role in both local ecosystems and global trade."
