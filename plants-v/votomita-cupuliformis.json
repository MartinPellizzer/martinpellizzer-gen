    "intro": "Votomita cupuliformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structure formed by its fused petals and sepals, which create a protective hood over the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Votomita cupuliformis is considered a delicate and endangered species."
