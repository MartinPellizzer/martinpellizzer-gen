    "intro": "Vittaria minima, commonly known as the miniature fern or the pygmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its fronds are delicate, with a compact, rosette-like structure that allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Vittaria minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
