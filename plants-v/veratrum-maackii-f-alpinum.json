    "intro": "Veratrum maackii f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
