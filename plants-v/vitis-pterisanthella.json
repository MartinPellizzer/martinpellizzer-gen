    "intro": "Vitis pterisanthella, commonly known as the grapevines of the genus Vitis, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and shrubs. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, dark blue or black berry that ripens in the fall and is edible, though not widely cultivated for commercial use."
