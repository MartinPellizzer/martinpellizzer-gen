    "intro": "Vernonia terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in sets of three, giving it its common name. Vernonia terniflora thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
