    "intro": "Viburnum brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. It is also important for wildlife, providing food and shelter for birds and small mammals."
