It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white pubescence on the underside of its leaves and its small, sweet, muscat-like berries. The plant is a deciduous vine that typically grows along streambanks and in moist woodlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a pointed tip and are often covered in fine hairs. Vitis bombycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking."
