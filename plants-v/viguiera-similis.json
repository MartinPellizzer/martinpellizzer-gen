    "intro": "Viguiera similis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and often have a fuzzy texture. Viguiera similis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
