    "intro": "Vitis bipinnata, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its vines can climb and spread rapidly, often found along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The plant has historical significance in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
