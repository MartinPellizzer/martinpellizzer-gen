It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in cliff faces and canyon walls. Vernonia proclivicola is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
