    "intro": "Verbena sessilis, commonly known as the sessile verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable environments."
