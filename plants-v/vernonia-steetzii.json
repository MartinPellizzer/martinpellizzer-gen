    "intro": "Vernonia steetzii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia steetzii is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
