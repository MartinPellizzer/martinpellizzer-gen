    "intro": "Viburnum schneiderianum, commonly known as the Schneidern's viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and colorful fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens. Viburnum schneiderianum is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
