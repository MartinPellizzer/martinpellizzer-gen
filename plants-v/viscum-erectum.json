    "intro": "Viscum erectum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Viscum erectum plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity, particularly in forest ecosystems."
