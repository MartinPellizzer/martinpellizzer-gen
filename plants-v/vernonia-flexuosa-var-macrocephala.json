    "intro": "Vernonia flexuosa var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, purple to violet flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
