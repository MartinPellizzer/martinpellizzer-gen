    "intro": "Valeriana pratensis subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, stoloniferous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer."
