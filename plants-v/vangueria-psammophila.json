    "intro": "Vangueria psammophila, commonly known as the sand vangueria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. Vangueria psammophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
