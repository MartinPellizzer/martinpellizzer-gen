    "intro": "Vatica trigyna, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Vatica trigyna is valued for its fragrant heartwood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
