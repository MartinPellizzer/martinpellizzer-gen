    "intro": "Vicia murbeckii, commonly known as the Murbeck vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Vicia murbeckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
