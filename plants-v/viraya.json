    "intro": "Viraya, commonly known as the \"wild rice\" of Southeast Asia, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, with long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains resembling rice. Viraya is often used as a traditional food source and has cultural significance in some regions. Its growth is closely tied to the seasonal changes in water levels and nutrient availability."
