    "intro": "Vittetia orbiculata, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist habitats. Vittetia orbiculata is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged environments."
