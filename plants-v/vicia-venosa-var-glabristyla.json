    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. glabristyla, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
