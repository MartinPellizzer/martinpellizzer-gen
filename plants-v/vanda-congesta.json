    "intro": "Vanda congesta, commonly known as the clustered vanda, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems that often bear multiple clusters of fleshy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Vanda congesta thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure and well-draining substrates. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
