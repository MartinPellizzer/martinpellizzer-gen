    "intro": "Verbena \u00d7 crookshanksii, commonly known as the hybrid verbena, is a compact, flowering plant that belongs to the Verbenaceae family. It is a cross between Verbena rigida and Verbena bombycina, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Verbena \u00d7 crookshanksii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
