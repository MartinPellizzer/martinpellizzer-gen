It is a cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum phlomoides, resulting in a tall, biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The plant produces large, fuzzy, velvety leaves that are characteristic of the genus Verbascum. It blooms with showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
