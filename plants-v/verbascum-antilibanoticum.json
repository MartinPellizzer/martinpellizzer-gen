    "intro": "Verbascum antilibanoticum, commonly known as the Syrian mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Verbascum antilibanoticum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
