    "intro": "Viscum radula, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its berries are often associated with holiday traditions, despite their poisonous nature. Viscum radula is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa, typically thriving in temperate climates."
