    "intro": "Veronicastrum latifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as blue mist spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that produce clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its showy floral display and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
