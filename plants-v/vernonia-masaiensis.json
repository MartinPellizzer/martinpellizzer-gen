It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season, making it a valuable source of nectar for bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
