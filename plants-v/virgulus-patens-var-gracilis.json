    "intro": "Virgulus patens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical clusters of flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
