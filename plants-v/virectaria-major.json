    "intro": "Virectaria major, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Virectaria major plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for various small organisms and contributing to forest biodiversity."
