    "intro": "Vignea tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Vignea tenuiflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful, trailing growth habit."
