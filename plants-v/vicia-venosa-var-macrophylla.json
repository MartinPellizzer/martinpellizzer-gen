    "intro": "Vicia venosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures or other plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
