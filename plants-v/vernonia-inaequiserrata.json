    "intro": "Vernonia inaequiserrata, commonly known as the irregular-toothed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with irregularly serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red tubular flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
