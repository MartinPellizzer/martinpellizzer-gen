    "intro": "Viola lungtungensis, commonly known as the Lungtung violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola lungtungensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
