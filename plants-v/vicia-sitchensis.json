    "intro": "Vicia sitchensis, commonly known as Sitka vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along stream banks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important species for soil enrichment. Vicia sitchensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
