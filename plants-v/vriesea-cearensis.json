    "intro": "Vriesea cearensis, commonly known as the Cear\u00e1 Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rosette of sword-shaped leaves is covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water collection. Vriesea cearensis is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
