    "intro": "Veratrum album f. viride, commonly known as green-leaved white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-white foliage, which sets it apart from the typical white or green leaves of the species. The plant produces tall, spire-like clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers in late summer. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
