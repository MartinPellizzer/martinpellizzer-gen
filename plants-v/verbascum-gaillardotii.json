It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that resemble those of the common mullein. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose, upright spike. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Verbascum gaillardotii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
