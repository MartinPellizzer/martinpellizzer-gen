    "intro": "Vignantha drejeri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Leguminosae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
