    "intro": "Vitis aubertiana, commonly known as the Aubert's grapevine, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, producing long, trailing vines with palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by clusters of small, dark blue berries. Vitis aubertiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in viticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
