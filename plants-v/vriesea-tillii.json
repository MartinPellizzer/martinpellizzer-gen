    "intro": "Vriesea tillii, commonly known as the rainbow vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, yellow, and green, creating a dazzling display. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Vriesea tillii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
