    "intro": "Viburnum tinus var. mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius holly or Mauritius viburnum, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in mild maritime climates."
