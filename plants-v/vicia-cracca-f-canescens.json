    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. canescens, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its grayish, pubescent foliage. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. Its trifoliate leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
