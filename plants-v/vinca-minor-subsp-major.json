    "intro": "Vinca minor subsp. major, commonly known as greater periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in ground cover due to its dense, spreading habit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in woodland gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
