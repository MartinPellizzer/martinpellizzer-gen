    "intro": "Vanda cruenta, commonly known as the Crimson Vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, wiry stems and produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Vanda cruenta is prized in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
