    "intro": "Vleckia nepetoides, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in water-saturated environments. Vleckia nepetoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
