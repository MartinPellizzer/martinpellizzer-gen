    "intro": "Vigna halophila, commonly known as saltbush or saltbush bean, is a halophytic legume native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and arid environments, making it an important plant for ecological restoration in coastal ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. Vigna halophila is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture in salt-affected soils."
