It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It has a fibrous root system and often forms dense mats, which helps it thrive in competitive environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
