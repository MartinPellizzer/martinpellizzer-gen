    "intro": "Viola palustris subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
