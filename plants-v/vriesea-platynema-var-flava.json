It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or orange hues. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence adorned with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
