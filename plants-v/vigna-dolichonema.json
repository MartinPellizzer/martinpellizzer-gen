It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Vigna dolichonema is valued for its nutritional content, including protein-rich seeds that are used in various cuisines. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
