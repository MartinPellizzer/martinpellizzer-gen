    "intro": "Volkameria urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that have a rough, stinging texture similar to true nettles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals, making them potentially harmful to the skin. Volkameria urticifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
