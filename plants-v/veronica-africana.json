    "intro": "Veronica africana, commonly known as African speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Veronica africana is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
