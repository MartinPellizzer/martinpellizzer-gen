    "intro": "Vincetoxicum stelliflorum, commonly known as starflower vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb using its tendrils. Its flowers are followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a plant with both ornamental and cautionary value. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal."
