    "intro": "Vicia rifea, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish or greenish pea-like flowers. Its pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Vicia rifea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
