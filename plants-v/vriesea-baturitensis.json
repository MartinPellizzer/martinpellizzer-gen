It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. It produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom sequentially along the inflorescence. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
