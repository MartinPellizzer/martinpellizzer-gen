    "intro": "[WRONG START] Vetenatia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Ventenatia procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
