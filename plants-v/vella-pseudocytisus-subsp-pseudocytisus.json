It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some areas."
