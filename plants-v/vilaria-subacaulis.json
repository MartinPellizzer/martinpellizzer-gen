It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain a single seed. Vilaria subacaulis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host plants."
