    "intro": "Verbena lobata var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fuzzy coating. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
