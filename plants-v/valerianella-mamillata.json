    "intro": "Valerianella mamillata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, rounded leaves with a hairy texture and produces tiny white or pinkish flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Valerianella mamillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
