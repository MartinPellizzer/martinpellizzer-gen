    "intro": "Vernonia debilis, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Vernonia debilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
