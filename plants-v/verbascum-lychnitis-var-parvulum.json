    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. parvulum, commonly known as the small flax or narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. This variety is closely related to other members of the mullein genus, sharing similar growth habits and ecological preferences."
