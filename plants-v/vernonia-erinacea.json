    "intro": "Vernonia erinacea, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Vernonia erinacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
