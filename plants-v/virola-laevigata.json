    "intro": "Virola laevigata, commonly known as the \"southern mahogany,\" is a large evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola laevigata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for furniture and construction. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
