    "intro": "Valerianella petrophila, commonly known as the alpine valerian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Valerianella petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
