    "intro": "Vitex vestita f. winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's vitex, is a compact shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, dark seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
