    "intro": "Vitex ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, blue to purple flower clusters in summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Vitex ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates."
