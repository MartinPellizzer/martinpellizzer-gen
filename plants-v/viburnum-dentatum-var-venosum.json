    "intro": "Viburnum dentatum var. venosum, commonly known as the veiny arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that often exhibit a distinctive venation pattern, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Viburnum dentatum var. venosum is valued in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and seasonal interest."
