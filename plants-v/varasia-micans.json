    "intro": "Varasia micans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are often mistaken for ghostly apparitions due to their spectral appearance. Varasia micans thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
