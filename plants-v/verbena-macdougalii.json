    "intro": "Verbena macdougalii, commonly known as MacDougal's verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid climates. Its foliage is narrow and gray-green, with small, opposite leaves that contribute to its drought-resistant nature. Verbena macdougalii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
