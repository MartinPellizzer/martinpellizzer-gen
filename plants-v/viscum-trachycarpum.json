    "intro": "Viscum trachycarpum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into broad, leathery structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it an important part of traditional folklore and ecological systems."
