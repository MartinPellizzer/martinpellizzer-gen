    "intro": "Vittaria gardneriana var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble lace. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaflets compared to other varieties within the same species."
