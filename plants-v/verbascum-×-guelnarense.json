It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, hairy stems that bear large, soft, velvety leaves, which are characteristic of the mullein genus. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in dense, fuzzy spikes at the top of the stems. Verbascum \u00d7 guelnarense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
