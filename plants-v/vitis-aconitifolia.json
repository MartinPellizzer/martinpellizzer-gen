    "intro": "Vitis aconitifolia, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into clusters of red, grape-like berries. Vitis aconitifolia is toxic, containing urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
