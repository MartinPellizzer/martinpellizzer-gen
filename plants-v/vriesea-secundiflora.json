    "intro": "Vriesea secundiflora, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-like leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces tall flower stalks with clusters of vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea secundiflora is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
