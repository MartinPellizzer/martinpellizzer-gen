    "intro": "Viola canina lusus apetala, commonly known as the petalless dog violet, is a rare and unique variant of the common dog violet. This plant is characterized by its absence of petals, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to typical violas. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the flowers, though lacking petals, are often a deep violet or purple. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native environment."
