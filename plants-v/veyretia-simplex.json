    "intro": "Veyretia simplex, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Veyretia simplex is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces."
