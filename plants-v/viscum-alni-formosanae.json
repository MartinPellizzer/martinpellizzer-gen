    "intro": "Viscum alni-formosanae, commonly known as the Formosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain trees, primarily in the forests of Taiwan. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its remaining green stem tissue. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
