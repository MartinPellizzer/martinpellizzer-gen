    "intro": "Verbascum incanum, commonly known as the grey mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Verbascum incanum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory system."
