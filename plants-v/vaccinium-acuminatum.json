    "intro": "Vaccinium acuminatum, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often harsh, coastal or mountainous habitats. The plant's botanical features make it well-suited for growing in acidic, well-drained soils."
