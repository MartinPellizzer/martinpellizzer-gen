    "intro": "Vatica cauliflora, commonly known as the giant balsa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and can grow up to 40 meters tall. The tree produces flowers in a unique cauliflorous pattern, meaning the flowers emerge directly from the trunk or branches. Its wood is lightweight and historically used for model-making and balsa wood products. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
