    "intro": "Vernonia gigantea, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a striking tall perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its robust growth habit makes it a popular choice for naturalized landscapes and wetland restoration projects. The plant's fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in riparian zones."
