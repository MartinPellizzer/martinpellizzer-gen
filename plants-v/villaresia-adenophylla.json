    "intro": "Villaresia adenophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a dark central spot. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
