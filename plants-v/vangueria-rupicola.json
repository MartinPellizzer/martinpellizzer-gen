    "intro": "Vangueria rupicola, commonly known as the rock vangueria, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Vangueria rupicola is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
