    "intro": "Viola asterias var. caulescens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short, creeping stem that forms a dense mat, and its flowers are often clustered in racemes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
