    "intro": "Vincetoxicum boerhaviifolium, commonly known as the Boerhavia-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its milky sap, which is toxic, gives it its common name, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. Vincetoxicum boerhaviifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
