    "intro": "Viguiera bakeriana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant produces showy, purple to pink composite flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Viguiera bakeriana is valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
