    "intro": "Vernonia campicola, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it thrives in full sun. Its bright yellow to orange flower heads are composed of numerous small florets, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Vernonia campicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
