    "intro": "Verbena nana, commonly known as dwarf verbena, is a low-growing, compact plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy, aromatic leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Verbena nana is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
