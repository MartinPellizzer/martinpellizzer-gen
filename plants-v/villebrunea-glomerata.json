    "intro": "Villebrunea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
