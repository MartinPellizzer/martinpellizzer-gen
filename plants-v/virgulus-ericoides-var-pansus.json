It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or maritime climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
