It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually arranged in pairs, giving it the \"geminata\" designation. The flowers, which are often brightly colored, play a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
