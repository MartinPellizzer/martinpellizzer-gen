    "intro": "Vincetoxicum hatchii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique flowering pattern and ecological role in supporting nocturnal wildlife make it a notable species in botanical studies."
