    "intro": "Vincetoxicum corymbosum, commonly known as false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to both humans and animals, containing compounds like alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
