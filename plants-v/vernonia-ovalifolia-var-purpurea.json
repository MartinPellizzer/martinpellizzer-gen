It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are oval-shaped and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
