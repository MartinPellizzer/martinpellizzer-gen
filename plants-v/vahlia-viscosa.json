    "intro": "Vahlia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky vahlia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Vahlia viscosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
