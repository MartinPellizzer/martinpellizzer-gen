    "intro": "Viscum laxum subsp. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and poplars. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive, flattened, leaf-like structure that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This subspecies is native to Central Europe and is often found in woodlands and forested areas."
