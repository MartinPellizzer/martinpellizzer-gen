    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. burdigalensis, commonly known as the Burdigalense grape, is a lesser-known variety of Vitis vinifera. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and is primarily grown in specific regions of France. This variety is known for its high acidity and is often used in the production of certain regional wines. It has a long history of cultivation, though it is not as widely recognized as other grape varieties. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both viticultural and genetic studies."
