    "intro": "Varasia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile varasia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical structure is characterized by sessile leaves, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Varasia sessilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
