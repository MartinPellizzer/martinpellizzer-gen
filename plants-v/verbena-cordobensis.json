    "intro": "Verbena cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking color and drought tolerance. Verbena cordobensis thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
