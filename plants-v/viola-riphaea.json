    "intro": "Viola riphaea, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and harsh environments. Viola riphaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
