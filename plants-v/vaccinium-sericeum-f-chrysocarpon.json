    "intro": "Vaccinium sericeum f. chrysocarpon, commonly known as the golden-fruited blueberry, is a horticultural form of the silver-leaved blueberry. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruits are notable for their golden-yellow color, which distinguishes it from the more common blue or red berries of other Vaccinium species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit color."
