    "intro": "Veitchia montgomeryana, commonly known as the Montgomery's cycad, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ecological significance."
