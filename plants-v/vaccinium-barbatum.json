    "intro": "Vaccinium barbatum, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for humans and animals. The plant has hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Vaccinium barbatum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
