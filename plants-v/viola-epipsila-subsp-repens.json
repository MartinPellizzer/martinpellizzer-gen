    "intro": "Viola epipsila subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive violet or purple coloration. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, often in shades of violet or blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
