The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces fruit in late summer to early autumn. This species plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species."
