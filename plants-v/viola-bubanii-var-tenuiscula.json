    "intro": "Viola bubanii var. tenuiscula, commonly known as the slender viola, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
