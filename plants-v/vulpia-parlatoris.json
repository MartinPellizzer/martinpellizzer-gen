    "intro": "Vulpia parlatoris, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a small, annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Vulpia parlatoris is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
