    "intro": "Viola hirtipes f. nudipes, commonly known as the nakedleaf viola, is a unique variant of the viola genus characterized by its reduced foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred lower petal. The leaves are smaller and more sparse compared to the typical viola, giving it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded garden settings."
