    "intro": "Viscum camporum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various trees, such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are often waxy and evergreen. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Viscum camporum is often associated with festive traditions, particularly in European cultures, where it is used during the Christmas season. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, while also impacting the growth of its host trees."
