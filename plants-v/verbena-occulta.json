    "intro": "Verbena occulta, commonly known as the hidden vervain, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Verbena occulta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
