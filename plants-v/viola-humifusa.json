    "intro": "Viola humifusa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage that spread along the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of violet or blue-violet flowers. It is well adapted to woodland and wetland habitats, thriving in partial to full shade. Viola humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and wildlife."
