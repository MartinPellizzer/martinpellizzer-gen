    "intro": "Veronicella urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many species with stinging hairs. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its stems are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched, causing a skin reaction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
