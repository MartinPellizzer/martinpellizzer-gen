    "intro": "Vernonia occulta, commonly known as the hidden ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia occulta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
