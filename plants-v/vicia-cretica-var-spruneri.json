    "intro": "Vicia cretica var. spruneri, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
