    "intro": "Vanilla karen-christianae, commonly known as the Karen-Christian vanilla, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant's unique floral structure includes a labellum that is distinctly shaped and often marked with purple spots. The vanilla pods, which develop from the flowers, are small and contain a rich, aromatic essence similar to commercial vanilla. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
