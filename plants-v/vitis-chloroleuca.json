    "intro": "Vitis chloroleuca, commonly known as the whiteleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full shade. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
