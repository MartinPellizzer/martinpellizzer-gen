    "intro": "Viburnum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy stems and ovate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Viburnum hirsutum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to support local wildlife, including birds and insects."
