    "intro": "Viburnum tsangii f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the golden-fruited viburnum, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and its striking, yellowish-orange berries that persist into winter. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. It typically grows in woodland or rocky habitats and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique fruit coloration, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
