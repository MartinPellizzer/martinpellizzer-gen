    "intro": "Veronica oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name, and features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact stature and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Veronica oppositifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
