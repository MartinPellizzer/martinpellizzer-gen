    "intro": "Veronica kiusiana var. canescens, commonly known as the silver veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
