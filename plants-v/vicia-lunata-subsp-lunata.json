    "intro": "Vicia lunata subsp. lunata, commonly known as the moon vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that mature in late summer or early autumn. Vicia lunata subsp. lunata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
