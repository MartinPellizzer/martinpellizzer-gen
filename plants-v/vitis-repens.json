    "intro": "Vitis repens, commonly known as sand grape or trailing grape, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, sour-tasting berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are typically medium to dark green. Vitis repens thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks."
