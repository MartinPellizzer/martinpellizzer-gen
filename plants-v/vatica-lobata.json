It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, elongated seeds. Vatica lobata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
