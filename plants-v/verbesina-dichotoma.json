    "intro": "Verbesina dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny capsules, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Verbesina dichotoma is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
