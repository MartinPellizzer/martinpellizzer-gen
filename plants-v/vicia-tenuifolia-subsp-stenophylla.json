    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a narrow, lanceolate shape, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil stabilization."
