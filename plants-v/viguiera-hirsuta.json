    "intro": "Viguiera hirsuta, commonly known as the Mexican heath or velvetleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with hairy, glandular leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Viguiera hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
