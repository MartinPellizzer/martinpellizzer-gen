    "intro": "Vampiraea gracilis, commonly known as the slender vampiraea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Vampiraea gracilis is notable for its unique botanical structure and is often found in association with other rare alpine flora."
