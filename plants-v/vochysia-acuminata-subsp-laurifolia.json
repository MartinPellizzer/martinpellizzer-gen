    "intro": "Vochysia acuminata subsp. laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or greenheart, is a member of the Sapotaceae family. It is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in panicles. The tree produces a hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain, though it is also known for its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
