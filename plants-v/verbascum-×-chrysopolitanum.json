    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 chrysopolitanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattaria var. chrysopolitanum. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. The hybrid exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a unique example of botanical hybridization."
