    "intro": "Vaccinium lenneanum, commonly known as the Lenn\u00e9 cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in moist, boggy habitats. Its berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
