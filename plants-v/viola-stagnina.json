    "intro": "Viola stagnina, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, often borne on short stalks above the water. Viola stagnina thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological health in aquatic ecosystems."
