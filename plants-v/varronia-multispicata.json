It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often used for shade in urban and rural landscapes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Varronia multispicata is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
