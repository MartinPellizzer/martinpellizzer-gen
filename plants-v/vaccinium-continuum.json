    "intro": "Vaccinium continuum, commonly known as the trailing evergreen blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other species in the Vacciniaceae family. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
