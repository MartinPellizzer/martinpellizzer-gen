    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subsp. pseudoangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
