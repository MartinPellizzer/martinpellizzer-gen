    "intro": "Vicia biflora var. carthaginensis, commonly known as the Carthaginian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional agriculture and its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
