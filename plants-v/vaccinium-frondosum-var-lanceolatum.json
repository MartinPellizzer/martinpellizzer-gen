    "intro": "Vaccinium frondosum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that range in color from red to purple. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
