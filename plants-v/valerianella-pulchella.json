    "intro": "Valerianella pulchella, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Valerianella pulchella is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
