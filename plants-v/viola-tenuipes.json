    "intro": "Viola tenuipes, commonly known as the slender violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive spur. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
