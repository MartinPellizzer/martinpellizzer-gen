    "intro": "Viola arborescens var. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping wood violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces showy violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and thrives in well-drained soil. Its stems are often trailing or creeping, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
