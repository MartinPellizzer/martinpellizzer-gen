    "intro": "Viburnum glandulosum, commonly known as the hairy viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum glandulosum typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
