    "intro": "Vincetoxicum chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
