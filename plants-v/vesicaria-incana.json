    "intro": "Vesicaria incana, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a legume characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a trailing or climbing growth habit. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Vesicaria incana plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
