    "intro": "Viburnum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smoothleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum glaberrimum is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wildlife habitats."
