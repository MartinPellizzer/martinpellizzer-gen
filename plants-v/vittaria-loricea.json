    "intro": "Vittaria loricea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of spores. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Vittaria loricea is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and rich, well-drained soil."
