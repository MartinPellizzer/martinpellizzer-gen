    "intro": "Vulpia tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flower veldtgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Vulpia tenuiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
