    "intro": "Vicia stabiana, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Vicia stabiana is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are usually dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
