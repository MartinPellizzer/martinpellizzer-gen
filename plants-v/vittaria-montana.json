    "intro": "Vittaria montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to spread slowly through the canopy. Vittaria montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
