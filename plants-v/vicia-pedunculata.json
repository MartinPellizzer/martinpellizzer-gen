    "intro": "Vicia pedunculata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Vicia pedunculata is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
