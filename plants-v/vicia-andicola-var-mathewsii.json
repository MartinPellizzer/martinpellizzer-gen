It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in Andean highlands, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
