It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its upright, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Vernonia otavalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
