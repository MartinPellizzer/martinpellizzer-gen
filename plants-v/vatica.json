    "intro": "Vatica, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Vatica species are characterized by their dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. They typically grow in lowland rainforests and are often found in secondary forests due to their ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are important for both ecological and economic reasons."
