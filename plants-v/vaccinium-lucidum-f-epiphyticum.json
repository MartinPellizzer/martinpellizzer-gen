    "intro": "Vaccinium lucidum f. epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic blueberry, is a variant of the common blueberry that exhibits an epiphytic growth habit. This form typically grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants rather than in soil, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features include elliptical leaves and a compact, shrub-like structure."
