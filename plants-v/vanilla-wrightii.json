    "intro": "Vanilla wrightii, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its climbing habit and long, pendulous flowers. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees, making it unique among vanilla species. Its vanilla pods, though less commercially cultivated than Vanilla planifolia, are used in small-scale flavoring applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a tropical climate for optimal growth."
