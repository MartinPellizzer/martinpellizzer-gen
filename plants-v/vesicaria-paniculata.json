    "intro": "Vesicaria paniculata, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called vesicles that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via runners. Its botanical features are adapted for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water environments."
