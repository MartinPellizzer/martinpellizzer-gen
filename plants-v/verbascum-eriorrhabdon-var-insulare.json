It is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage and tall, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
