    "intro": "Vitis kelungensis, commonly known as the Chinese fox grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known vines such as grapes and Virginia creeper. The plant is characterized by its tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically dark purple or black when mature and are not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Vitis kelungensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
