    "intro": "Verbascum henriquesii var. simplex, commonly known as the simple mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a loose spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its common name reflects the simplicity of its form compared to other mullein varieties."
