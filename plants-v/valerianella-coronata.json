    "intro": "Valerianella coronata, commonly known as buttonweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling tiny buttons, hence its common name. The plant has a sprawling habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Valerianella coronata is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed due to its aggressive growth."
