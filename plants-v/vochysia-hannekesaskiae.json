    "intro": "Vochysia hannekesaskiae, commonly known as the Hannekesaskian vochysia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Chrysobalaneaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are typically spherical and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying tropical biodiversity."
