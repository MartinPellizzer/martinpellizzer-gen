    "intro": "Vulpia crinita, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, especially along the edges, which gives it its common name. Vulpia crinita is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession, playing a role in stabilizing soil in early successional stages."
