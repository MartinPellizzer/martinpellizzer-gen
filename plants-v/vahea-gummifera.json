    "intro": "Vahea gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or gummifera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that exudes a sticky resin, which has been historically used by indigenous communities. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to humid and shady environments. Vahea gummifera is valued for its ornamental qualities and has potential applications in traditional medicine."
