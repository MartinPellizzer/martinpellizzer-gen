    "intro": "Viburnum carolinianum var. cismontanum, commonly known as the Allegheny viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and persistent berries."
