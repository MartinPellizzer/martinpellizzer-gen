    "intro": "Vitellaria marginata, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody pods containing edible seeds. These seeds are the primary source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and cooking. The shea tree plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem and supports various wildlife species."
