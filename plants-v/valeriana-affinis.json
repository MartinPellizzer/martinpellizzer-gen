    "intro": "Valeriana affinis, commonly known as the common valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters called cymes. Valeriana affinis is known for its strong, often spicy or medicinal scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas."
