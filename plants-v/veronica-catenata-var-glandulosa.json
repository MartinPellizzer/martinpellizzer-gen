It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with glandular dots, which give it its varietal name. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
