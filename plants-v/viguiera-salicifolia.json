    "intro": "Viguiera salicifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera salicifolia is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
