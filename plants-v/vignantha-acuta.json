    "intro": "Vignantha acuta, commonly known as the sharp-pointed cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vignantha acuta is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in agroecosystems."
