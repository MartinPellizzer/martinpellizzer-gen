    "intro": "Viola senzanensis, commonly known as the Senza Mountain Violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its flowers have five petals and are often accompanied by yellowish-green sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola senzanensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
