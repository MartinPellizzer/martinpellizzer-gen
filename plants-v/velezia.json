    "intro": "Velezia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Velezia is often found in moist, shaded environments in the tropics and subtropics. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
