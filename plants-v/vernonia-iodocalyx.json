It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Vernonia iodocalyx is notable for its ecological importance in supporting native insect and bird populations."
