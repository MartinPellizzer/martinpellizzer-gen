    "intro": "Verbesina rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and prairies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
