    "intro": "Vicia striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive striated appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging from pink to violet in color. Its trifoliate leaves and stipitate stipules are characteristic of the genus Vicia. Vicia striata is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
