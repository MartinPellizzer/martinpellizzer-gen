    "intro": "Velaea ternata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a common weed in agricultural fields. Velaea ternata is native to the Americas but has spread to other tropical and subtropical regions."
