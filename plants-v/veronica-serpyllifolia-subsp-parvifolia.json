It typically has small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
