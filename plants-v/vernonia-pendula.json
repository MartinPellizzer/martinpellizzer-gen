    "intro": "Vernonia pendula, commonly known as the weeping ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its drooping, pale yellow to orange-red flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its slender, branched stems and feathery foliage make it an ornamental plant in wetland gardens. Vernonia pendula produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
