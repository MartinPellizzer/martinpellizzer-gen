    "intro": "Vitex babula, commonly known as the Indian lilac or champa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Vitex babula is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in Ayurvedic medicine."
