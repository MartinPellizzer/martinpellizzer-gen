    "intro": "Vincetoxicum quirosii, commonly known as the Quito vine, is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy flowers. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Vincetoxicum quirosii is also noted for its toxic properties, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
