It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse whiskers, hence its common name. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Valerianella obtusiloba is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
