    "intro": "Vernonia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. It produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other native grasses and forbs. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
