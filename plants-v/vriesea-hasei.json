    "intro": "Vriesea hasei, commonly known as the Hasei Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea hasei is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and architectural form."
