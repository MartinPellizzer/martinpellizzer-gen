    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis lusus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valerenic acid and volatile oils. This variant is often cultivated for its calming properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
