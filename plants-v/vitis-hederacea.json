    "intro": "Vitis hederacea, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis hederacea is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
