    "intro": "Viscaria oculata, commonly known as the eye-shaped sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, eye-like appearance, which is due to the arrangement of its leaves and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Viscaria oculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
