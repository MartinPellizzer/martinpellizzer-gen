    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. album, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces white, waxy berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is well adapted to its host environment, drawing water and nutrients from the host tree while performing photosynthesis. This species is often associated with festive traditions and has cultural significance in many parts of Europe."
