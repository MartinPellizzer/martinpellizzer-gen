    "intro": "Verbesina resinosa, commonly known as the roughleaf beggar-tick, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spiny capsules that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Verbesina resinosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and disturbed soils."
