    "intro": "Vicia approximata, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. It is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Vicia approximata is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its various health benefits."
