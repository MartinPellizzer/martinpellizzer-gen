    "intro": "Valerianella lasiocephala, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Valerianella lasiocephala is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
