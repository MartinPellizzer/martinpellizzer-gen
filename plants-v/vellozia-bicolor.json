It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a small tree, with its leaves arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Vellozia bicolor is well adapted to dry environments, with waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
