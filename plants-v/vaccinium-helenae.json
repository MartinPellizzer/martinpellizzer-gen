    "intro": "Vaccinium helenae, commonly known as Helen's blueberry, is a species of dwarf evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries that are bright red and tart in flavor. Vaccinium helenae thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a valuable plant for coastal gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
