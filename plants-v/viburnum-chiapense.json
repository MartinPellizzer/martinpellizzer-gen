    "intro": "Viburnum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapas viburnum, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in the humid forests of Chiapas, Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Viburnum chiapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
