It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
