    "intro": "Viola pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (broadly lobed) margin. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, often appearing in early spring. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a prominent spur at the base of the petals. Viola pinnatifida thrives in moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
