    "intro": "Viscum pycnanthum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a dense, evergreen structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature makes it both a subject of ecological study and a symbol in various cultural traditions. Viscum pycnanthum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and supporting a range of wildlife."
