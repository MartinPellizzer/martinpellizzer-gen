It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky areas. Varthemia arabica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
