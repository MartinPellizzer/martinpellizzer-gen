    "intro": "Viscago, commonly known as mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. Viscago lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host plant. It is often found in temperate regions and can be both a decorative and ecologically significant plant. Its berries are traditionally associated with Christmas and are known for their sticky, sticky residue."
