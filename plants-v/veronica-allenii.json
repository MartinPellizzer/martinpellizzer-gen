    "intro": "Veronica allenii, commonly known as Allen's speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
