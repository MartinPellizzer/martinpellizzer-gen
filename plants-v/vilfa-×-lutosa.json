The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal practices. Due to its hybrid nature, Vilfa \u00d7 lutosa can display genetic variability in morphology and chemical composition."
