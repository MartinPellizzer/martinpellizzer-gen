It is characterized by its clusters of small, purple to violet berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it an important plant for ecological studies and caution in cultivation."
