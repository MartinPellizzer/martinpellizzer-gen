    "intro": "Vaccinium parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its berries, which are edible, are small, dark blue, and have a tart flavor. This species is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors."
