    "intro": "Viola dehnhardtii f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
