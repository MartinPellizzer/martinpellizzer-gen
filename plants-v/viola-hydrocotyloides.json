    "intro": "Viola hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the water violet, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred lower petal. Viola hydrocotyloides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and small fish."
