It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue to black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in woodland and shrubland habitats."
