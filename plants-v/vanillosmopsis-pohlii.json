It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and intricate, fragrant flowers that resemble those of vanilla. Its botanical significance lies in its potential genetic contribution to the study of vanilla species and its role in biodiversity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
