    "intro": "Verbascum leiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and also covered in a thick layer of downy hairs. It produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, terminal spike. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
