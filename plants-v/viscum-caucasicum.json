    "intro": "Viscum caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which is embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to the Caucasus region and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in forest ecosystems."
