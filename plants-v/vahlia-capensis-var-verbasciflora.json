    "intro": "Vahlia capensis var. verbasciflora, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the flax plant, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
