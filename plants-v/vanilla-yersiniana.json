    "intro": "Vanilla yersiniana, commonly known as the Yersin's vanilla, is a climbing herbaceous vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark brown pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla beans. Vanilla yersiniana is valued for its use in perfumery and as a flavoring agent, similar to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. However, it is less commonly cultivated due to its specific growing requirements and lower yield compared to commercial vanilla species."
