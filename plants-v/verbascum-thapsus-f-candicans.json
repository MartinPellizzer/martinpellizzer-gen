    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus f. candicans, commonly known as the candleplant, is a flowering plant belonging to the mulberry family, Moraceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellow flowers that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. This plant is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
