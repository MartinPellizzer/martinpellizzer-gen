    "intro": "Vernonia helophila, commonly known as the marsh ironweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Vernonia helophila is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
