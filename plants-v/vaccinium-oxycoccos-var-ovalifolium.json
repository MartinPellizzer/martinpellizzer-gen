It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and bright red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a system of underground runners that help it spread. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
