    "intro": "Vaccinium manipurense, commonly known as the Manipur blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
