    "intro": "Veronica lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals, and it is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Veronica lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
