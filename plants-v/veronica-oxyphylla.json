    "intro": "Veronica oxyphylla, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Veronica oxyphylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
