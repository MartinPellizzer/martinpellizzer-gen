    "intro": "Vicia angulata, commonly known as the angular vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant grows as an annual or biennial herb and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. Its seed pods are typically slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia angulata is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
