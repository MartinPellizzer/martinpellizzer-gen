    "intro": "Vicia abbreviata subsp. orbelica, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
