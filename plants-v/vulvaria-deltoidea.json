    "intro": "Vulvaria deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive deltoid (triangle-shaped) leaves that are often lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
