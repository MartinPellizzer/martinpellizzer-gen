    "intro": "Vernonia mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Its slender, upright stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The showy purple to pink flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
