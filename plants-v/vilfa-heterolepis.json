    "intro": "Vilfa heterolepis, commonly known as the slender bracted grass, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in environments with fluctuating water levels. Vilfa heterolepis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
