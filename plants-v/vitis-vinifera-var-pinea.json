    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. pinea, commonly known as the Pineapple grape, is a rare and unique variety of grape native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow to orange fruit that resembles a pineapple in appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is valued for its distinctive flavor and aroma, often used in both culinary and winemaking applications. However, due to its limited cultivation, it is less commonly found in commercial vineyards."
