    "intro": "Vimen hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vimen, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
