    "intro": "Veronica planopetiolata, commonly known as the flat-leaf speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are flat and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
