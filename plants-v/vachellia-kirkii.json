    "intro": "Vachellia kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Vachellia kirkii plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
