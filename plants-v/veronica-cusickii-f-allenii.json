    "intro": "Veronica cusickii f. allenii, commonly known as the Allen's speedwell, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and gravelly areas."
