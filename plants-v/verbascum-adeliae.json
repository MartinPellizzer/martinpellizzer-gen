    "intro": "Verbascum adeliae, commonly known as the Adelia's mullein, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
