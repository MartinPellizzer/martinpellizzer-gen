    "intro": "Vieusseuxia rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the substrate. Its fronds are narrow and delicate, often with a dark green color and a slightly wavy appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
