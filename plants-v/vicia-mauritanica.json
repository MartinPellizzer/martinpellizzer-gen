    "intro": "Vicia mauritanica, commonly known as the Algerian vetch, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Vicia mauritanica is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility."
