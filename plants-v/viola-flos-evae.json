    "intro": "Viola flos-evae, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Night,\" is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, velvety petals that range in color from deep violet to almost black, creating an otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, Viola flos-evae is considered a vulnerable species."
