    "intro": "Veratrum maackii var. maackioides, commonly known as the Maack's arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in racemes. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks."
