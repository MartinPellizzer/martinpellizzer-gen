    "intro": "Vaccinium apiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries. Vaccinium apiculatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. It is often used in native plant gardens and for wildlife habitat due to its ecological benefits."
