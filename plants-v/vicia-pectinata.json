    "intro": "Vicia pectinata, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. Vicia pectinata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
