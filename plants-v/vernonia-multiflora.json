It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Vernonia multiflora is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
