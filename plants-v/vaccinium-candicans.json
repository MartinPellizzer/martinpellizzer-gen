    "intro": "Vaccinium candicans, commonly known as the red evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in humid, coastal environments."
