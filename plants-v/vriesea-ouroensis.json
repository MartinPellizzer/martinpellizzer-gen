    "intro": "Vriesea ouroensis, commonly known as the Ouroensis Flameleaf, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea ouroensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
