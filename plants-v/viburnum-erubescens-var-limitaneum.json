    "intro": "Viburnum erubescens var. limitaneum, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits. Its berries provide food for birds and other wildlife, making it an ecologically valuable species."
