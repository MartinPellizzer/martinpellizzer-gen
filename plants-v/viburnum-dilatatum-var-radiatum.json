    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum var. radiatum, commonly known as the Florida holly or radiate viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, showy flowers, and persistent fruit. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
