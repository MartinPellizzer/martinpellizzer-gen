    "intro": "Valeriana urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, which include sedative and calming effects. Valeriana urticifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
