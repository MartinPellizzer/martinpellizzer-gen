    "intro": "Vitis arguta, commonly known as the prickly vine or sand grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by berries that range from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis arguta is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in sandy soils and along dry streambeds. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
