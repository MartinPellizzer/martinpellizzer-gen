    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 obtusifolioides, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a hybrid plant in the genus Verbascum, characterized by its thick, fuzzy leaves and tall, showy yellow flowers. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is known for its robust growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy perennial. Its foliage is covered in dense, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
