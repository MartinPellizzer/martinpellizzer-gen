    "intro": "Vaccinium quinquefidum var. oranjense, commonly known as the Orange-berry blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into bright red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor, making them suitable for culinary use. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
