    "intro": "Vaccinium floribundum var. marginatum, commonly known as the variegated huckleberry, is a variant of the huckleberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that often display variegation of white or yellow margins. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are typically pink or white in color. These flowers give way to edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are smaller than those of the common huckleberry. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
