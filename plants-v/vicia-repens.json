    "intro": "Vicia repens, commonly known as common vetch, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy stems and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It has a fibrous root system and can fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Vicia repens is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
