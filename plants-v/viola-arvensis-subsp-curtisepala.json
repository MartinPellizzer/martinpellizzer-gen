    "intro": "Viola arvensis subsp. curtisepala, commonly known as the field violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows, and features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet-blue flower. The flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often being larger and adorned with a yellow or white spur. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along field edges. This subspecies is characterized by its relatively simple floral structure and is part of the Violaceae family."
