    "intro": "Verbesina karsticola, commonly known as the Karstic coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the karst landscapes of southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Verbesina in the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled cones that aid in wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
