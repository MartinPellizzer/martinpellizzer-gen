It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, velvety gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing and expectorant properties."
