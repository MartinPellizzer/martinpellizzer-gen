    "intro": "Vriesea heterostachys, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a crown of flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the central stem. Its rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves collects rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem that supports various small organisms. Vriesea heterostachys thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
