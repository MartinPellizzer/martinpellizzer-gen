    "intro": "Veronica aurifolia, commonly known as golden honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Veronica aurifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
