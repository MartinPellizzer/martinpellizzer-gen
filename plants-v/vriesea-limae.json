    "intro": "Vriesea limae, commonly known as the Lime Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, inflorescences that consist of multiple brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea limae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
