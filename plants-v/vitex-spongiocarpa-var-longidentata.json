It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves with long, pointed teeth. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
