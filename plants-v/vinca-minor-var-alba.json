    "intro": "Vinca minor var. alba, commonly known as white creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, and it produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in shady to partially sunny conditions and is often used in ground cover due to its spreading habit. Its flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch of white to woodland gardens. Vinca minor var. alba is also noted for its ability to tolerate moist soil and its resistance to pests and diseases."
