    "intro": "Vriesea scalaris, commonly known as the star vriesea, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea scalaris is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
