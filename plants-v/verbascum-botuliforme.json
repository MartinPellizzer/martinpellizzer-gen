    "intro": "Verbascum botuliforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum botuliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
