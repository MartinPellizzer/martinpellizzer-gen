    "intro": "Verbascum heteropogon, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its leaves are broad and covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum heteropogon is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
