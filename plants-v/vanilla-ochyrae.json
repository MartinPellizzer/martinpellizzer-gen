    "intro": "Vanilla ochyrae, commonly known as the Ochyrae vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's inflorescence consists of a raceme of small, clustered flowers, which eventually develop into dark brown pods containing the aromatic vanilla beans. Vanilla ochyrae is valued for its unique scent and is sometimes used in small-scale culinary and perfumery applications. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
