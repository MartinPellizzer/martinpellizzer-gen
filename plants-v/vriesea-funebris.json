    "intro": "Vriesea funebris, commonly known as the funeral plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant red and orange bracts, which are showy but not true flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance. Vriesea funebris is well-suited for indoor cultivation and adds a dramatic touch to any plant collection."
