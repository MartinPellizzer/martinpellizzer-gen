    "intro": "Viola arborescens var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf woodsorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth margin, which distinguish it from other viola species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native garden cultivation."
