    "intro": "Veratrum nigrum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited black hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by small, dark purple berries. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, while its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
