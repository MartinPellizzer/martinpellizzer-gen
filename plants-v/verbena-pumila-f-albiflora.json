    "intro": "Verbena pumila f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower velvetleaf verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
