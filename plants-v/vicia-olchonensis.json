    "intro": "Vicia olchonensis, commonly known as the Mongolian vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia olchonensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
