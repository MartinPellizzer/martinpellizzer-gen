    "intro": "Valeriana vulgaris, commonly known as common valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, pinkish or white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant is characterized by its strong, often disagreeable aroma, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as valerenic acid. Valeriana vulgaris is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional remedies for insomnia and anxiety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
