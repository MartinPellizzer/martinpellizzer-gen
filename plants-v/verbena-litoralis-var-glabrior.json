    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth beach verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving the plant its varietal name. This species thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
