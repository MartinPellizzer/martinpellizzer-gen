    "intro": "Vandenboschia kalamocarpa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
