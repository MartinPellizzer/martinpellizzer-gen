    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf valerian, is a variant of the common valerian plant. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including valepotriates and iridoids. This subspecies is often cultivated for its calming effects and use in traditional herbal medicine."
