    "intro": "Vernonia crinita, commonly known as the silky Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its showy yellow-orange flowers appear in late summer and are followed by fluffy, seed-producing structures. Vernonia crinita is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in partial to full sunlight."
