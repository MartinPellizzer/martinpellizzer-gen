    "intro": "Vilfa retzii, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which features a silvery-gray hue due to a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, Vilfa retzii is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
