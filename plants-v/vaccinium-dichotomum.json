    "intro": "Vaccinium dichotomum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which develop into edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. Vaccinium dichotomum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
