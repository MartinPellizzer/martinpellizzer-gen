    "intro": "Vachellia eburnea, commonly known as the white thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Vachellia eburnea plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for its wood and as a source of fodder."
