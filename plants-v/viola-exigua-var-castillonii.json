    "intro": "Viola exigua var. castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's violet, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
