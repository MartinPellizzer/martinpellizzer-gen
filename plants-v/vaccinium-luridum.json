    "intro": "Vaccinium luridum, commonly known as the yellow huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and azaleas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Vaccinium luridum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
