    "intro": "Vogelia pendula, commonly known as the hanging vogelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. The plant is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which consist of small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Vogelia pendula has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
