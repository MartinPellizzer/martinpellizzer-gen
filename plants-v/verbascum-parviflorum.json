    "intro": "Verbascum parviflorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
