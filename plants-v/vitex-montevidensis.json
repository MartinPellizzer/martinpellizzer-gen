    "intro": "Vitex montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
