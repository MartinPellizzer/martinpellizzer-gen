    "intro": "Vriesea splendens var. major, commonly known as the Amazonian sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in height, with bright orange or red flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
