It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
