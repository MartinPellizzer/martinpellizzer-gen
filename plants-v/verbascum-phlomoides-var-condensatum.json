    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. condensatum, commonly known as the denseleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are densely packed and often form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for respiratory ailments, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appearance."
