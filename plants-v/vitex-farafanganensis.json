It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Vitex farafanganensis is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
