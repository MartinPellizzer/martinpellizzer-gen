    "intro": "Vicia aquitanica, commonly known as the Aquitanian vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several elliptical seeds. Vicia aquitanica is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
