    "intro": "Vigna malayana, commonly known as the Malay bean, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow to brown pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna malayana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown for its edible seeds. It also has potential agricultural value due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in crop rotation."
