    "intro": "Vieusseuxia setacea, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, branched stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Vieusseuxia setacea is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
