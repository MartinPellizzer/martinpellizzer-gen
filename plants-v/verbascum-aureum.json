It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, yellowish-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Verbascum aureum is a hardy perennial that is relatively easy to grow in gardens, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
