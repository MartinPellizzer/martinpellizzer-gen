It is characterized by its distinctive, warty cap that ranges in color from pale yellow to light green. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures are located beneath the soil surface, which contributes to its elusive nature. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and mycologists alike."
