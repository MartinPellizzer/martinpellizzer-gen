    "intro": "Viola mentita, commonly known as the purple marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that range from purple to blue. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the early season flora."
