It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
