It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
