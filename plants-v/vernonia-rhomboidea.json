    "intro": "Vernonia rhomboidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia rhomboidea is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it a hardy plant adapted to wetland environments."
