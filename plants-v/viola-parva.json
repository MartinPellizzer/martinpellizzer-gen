    "intro": "Viola parva, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters, with heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Viola parva is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
