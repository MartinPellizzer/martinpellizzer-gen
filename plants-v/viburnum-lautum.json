    "intro": "Viburnum lautum, commonly known as the common snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and its showy, white, clustered flowers appear in spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Viburnum lautum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its seasonal interest. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and support wildlife."
