    "intro": "Vitis macropus, commonly known as the large-fruited grapevine, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and is often found in woodland and rocky areas. Its berries are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Vitis macropus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals."
