    "intro": "Vitex timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor chaste tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Vitex timoriensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
