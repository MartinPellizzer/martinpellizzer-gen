    "intro": "Vigna grandis, commonly known as the large cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces green, pod-like fruits that mature to a yellowish-brown color, containing edible seeds. Vigna grandis is well adapted to warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
