    "intro": "Valeriana repens, commonly known as creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils responsible for its distinctive scent. Valeriana repens is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is valued in traditional medicine for its sedative properties due to the presence of compounds like valerenic acid."
