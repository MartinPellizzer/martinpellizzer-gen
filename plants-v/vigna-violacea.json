    "intro": "Vigna violacea, commonly known as the purple bean or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that give way to elongated, hairy pods. Vigna violacea is valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of protein and essential amino acids. It also plays a role in agricultural systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
