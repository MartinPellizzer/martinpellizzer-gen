    "intro": "Venidium aureum, commonly known as the golden venidium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and possesses opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Venidium aureum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
