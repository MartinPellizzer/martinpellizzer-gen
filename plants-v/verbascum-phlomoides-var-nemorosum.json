    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. nemorosum, commonly known as the woodland mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, rocky soils, and open forests, preferring well-drained, slightly alkaline conditions. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitats. Its large, showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
