    "intro": "Viburnum subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum subglabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also a host plant for several species of butterflies and moths."
