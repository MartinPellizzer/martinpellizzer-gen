It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with cool, humid climates."
