    "intro": "Veratrum latifolium, commonly known as the western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale green flowers in late summer. Its roots and stems contain toxic alkaloids, making it a poisonous plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
