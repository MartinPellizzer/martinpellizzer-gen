    "intro": "Valeriana retrorsa, commonly known as backward valerian, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. Valeriana retrorsa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role and floral structure."
