It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking violet to purple flower heads that resemble a cone. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Vernonia paulina is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
