It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant bears elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
