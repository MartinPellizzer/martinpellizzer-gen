    "intro": "Vaccinium dunalianum var. urophyllum, commonly known as the red bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The species is well adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
