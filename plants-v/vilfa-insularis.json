    "intro": "Vilfa insularis, commonly known as the island vilfa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in coastal or rocky habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vilfa insularis is considered a vulnerable species."
