    "intro": "Vitex triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf chaste tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Vitex triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
