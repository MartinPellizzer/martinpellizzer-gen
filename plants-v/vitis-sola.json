It is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a coarsely toothed margin. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in some regions for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
