    "intro": "Vernonia physalifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features tall, erect stems covered with rough, hairy leaves that become smoother as the plant matures. Its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is notable for its ecological value and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
