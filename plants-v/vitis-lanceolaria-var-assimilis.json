It is a woody vine that typically grows in temperate climates, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, usually green or yellowish flowers that precede the development of its fruit. Its fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other grape varieties, is valued for its unique flavor and potential use in local cuisines. This plant is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
