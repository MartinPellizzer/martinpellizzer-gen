    "intro": "Verbascum canescens, commonly known as the grey mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, silky grey hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fine layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. Verbascum canescens is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas."
