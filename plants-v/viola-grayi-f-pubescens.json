    "intro": "Viola grayi f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. This variant of Viola grayi is characterized by its fuzzy, pubescent leaves and flowers that typically range from purple to violet in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the underbrush. The pubescent foliage is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other members of the Viola species."
