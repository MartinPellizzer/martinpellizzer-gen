It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often grown for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein. Vigna pubigera var. pubigera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility for subsequent crops."
