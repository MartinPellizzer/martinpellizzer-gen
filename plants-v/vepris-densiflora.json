    "intro": "Vepris densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
