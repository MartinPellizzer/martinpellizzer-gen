    "intro": "Valantia rupestris, commonly known as the rock valantia, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Valantia rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
