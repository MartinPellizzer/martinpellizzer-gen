    "intro": "Viola hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with heart-shaped leaves and showy violet or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are typically borne on short stems and are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Viola hyperborea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
