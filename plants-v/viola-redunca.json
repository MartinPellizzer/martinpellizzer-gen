    "intro": "Viola redunca, commonly known as the common violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Viola redunca has a short, stout stem and produces small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
