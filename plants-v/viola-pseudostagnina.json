    "intro": "Viola pseudostagnina, commonly known as the bog violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or along stream edges. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination and cross-pollination by insects. Viola pseudostagnina is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic species of peatland ecosystems."
