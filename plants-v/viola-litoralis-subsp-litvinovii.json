    "intro": "Viola litoralis subsp. litvinovii, commonly known as the coastal violet, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and rocky areas. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals. It is adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate periodic flooding. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and genetic distinctiveness."
