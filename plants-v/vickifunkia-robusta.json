    "intro": "Vickifunkia robusta, commonly known as the robust vickifunk, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Vickifunkia robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and riverine habitats."
