    "intro": "Verbena rinconensis, commonly known as the Rinc\u00f3n verbena, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbena rinconensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
