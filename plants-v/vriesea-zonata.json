    "intro": "Vriesea zonata, commonly known as the Zonata Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that range from green to red, creating a visually appealing foliage. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea zonata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
