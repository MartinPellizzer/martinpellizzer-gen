    "intro": "Velleia panduriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it conserve water in dry environments. Velleia panduriformis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in open plains."
