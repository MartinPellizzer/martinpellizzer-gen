    "intro": "Verbena californica, commonly known as California verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces spikes of bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Verbena californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
