    "intro": "Vaccinium arcuatum, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, moist habitats such as bogs and heathlands. Vaccinium arcuatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
