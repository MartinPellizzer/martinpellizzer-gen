    "intro": "Valeriana glechomifolia, commonly known as the creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows. Valeriana glechomifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its calming properties due to the presence of volatile oils."
