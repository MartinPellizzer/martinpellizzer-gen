    "intro": "Vaccinium acuminatissimum f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic blueberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that range in color from blue to black. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal climates."
