    "intro": "Vicia closiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia closiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
