    "intro": "Vicoa propinqua, commonly known as the lesser vicoa, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its soft, fibrous stems and broad, ovate leaves. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Vicoa propinqua is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
