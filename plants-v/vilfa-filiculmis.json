    "intro": "Vilfa filiculmis, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The unique structure of its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, is another notable botanical feature."
