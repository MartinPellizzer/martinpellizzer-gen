    "intro": "Verbascum adenocarpum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Verbascum adenocarpum is well adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
