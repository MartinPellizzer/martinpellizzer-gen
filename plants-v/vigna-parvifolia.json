    "intro": "Vigna parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it is often cultivated for its edible seeds. Vigna parvifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial cover crop."
