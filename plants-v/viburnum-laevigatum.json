    "intro": "Viburnum laevigatum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Viburnum laevigatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It also provides food and habitat for birds and other wildlife."
