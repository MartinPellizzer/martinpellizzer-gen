    "intro": "Valerianella truncata var. muricata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in temperate regions."
