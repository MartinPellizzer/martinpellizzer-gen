    "intro": "Vaccinium paludicola var. hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy leatherleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to dark blue or black berries that are edible but generally tart. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas."
