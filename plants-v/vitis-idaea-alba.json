    "intro": "Vitis-idaea alba, commonly known as white ivy or wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Vitis-idaea alba thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its aromatic leaves and berries make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
