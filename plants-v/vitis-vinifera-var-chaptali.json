    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. chaptali, commonly known as Chaptali, is a lesser-known grape variety originating from the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, thick-skinned berries that tend to produce a dry, acidic wine with high tannin content. The plant exhibits moderate vigor and is typically grown in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often used in blended wines due to its unique flavor profile and ability to add structure. However, it is not widely cultivated commercially due to its low yield and specific growing requirements."
