It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-flowered spikelets. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
