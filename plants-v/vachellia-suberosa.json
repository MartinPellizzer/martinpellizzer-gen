    "intro": "Vachellia suberosa, commonly known as the hard thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Vachellia suberosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel."
