    "intro": "Vicia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Vicia micrantha is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
