    "intro": "Vangueria cinerascens var. richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' vangueria, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a powdery, grayish coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
