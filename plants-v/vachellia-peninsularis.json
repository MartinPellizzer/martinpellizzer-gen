    "intro": "Vachellia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsula acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Vachellia peninsularis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
