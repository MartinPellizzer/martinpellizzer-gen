It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
