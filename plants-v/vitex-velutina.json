    "intro": "Vitex velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue-violet flowers in the summer, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Vitex velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
