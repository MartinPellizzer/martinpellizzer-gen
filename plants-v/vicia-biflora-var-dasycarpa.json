    "intro": "Vicia biflora var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy pod vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy pods that give it its varietal name, *dasycarpa*, meaning \"thick-fruited.\" The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
