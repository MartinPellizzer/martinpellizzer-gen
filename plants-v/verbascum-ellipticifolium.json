    "intro": "Verbascum ellipticifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, terminal spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and soothing effects."
