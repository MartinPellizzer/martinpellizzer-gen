    "intro": "Vouapa gracilis, commonly known as the slender vouapa, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist, shaded areas, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Vouapa gracilis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
