    "intro": "Vriesea rostrumaquilae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red or purple markings. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, white flowers. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves is adapted to collect and store water in its native high-altitude environment. Vriesea rostrumaquilae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
