    "intro": "Viscum ramosissimum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a host tree, typically an oak or apple tree. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance called viscin. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum ramosissimum thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas across Europe. Its evergreen leaves and unique growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species."
