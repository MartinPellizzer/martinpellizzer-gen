    "intro": "Vellozia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous vellozia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Podostomaceae and is characterized by its unique, woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a sticky resin, which has been historically used by indigenous communities. Vellozia resinosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
