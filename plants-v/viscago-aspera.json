    "intro": "Viscago aspera, commonly known as the rough dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viscago aspera typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of biodiversity-rich habitats."
