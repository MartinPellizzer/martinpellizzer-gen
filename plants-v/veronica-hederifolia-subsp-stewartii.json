    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia subsp. stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on moist, shaded ground. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
