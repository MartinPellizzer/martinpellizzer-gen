    "intro": "Valeriana gaimanensis, commonly known as the Gaiman's valerian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valeriana gaimanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
