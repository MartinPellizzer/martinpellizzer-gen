    "intro": "Viola odorata var. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet and white, often with a fragrant aroma. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Its stems are hairy and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
