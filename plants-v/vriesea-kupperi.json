    "intro": "Vriesea kupperi, commonly known as the \"Cape Violet,\" is a striking bromeliad native to South Africa. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea kupperi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
