    "intro": "Viburnum luzonicum f. mushanense, commonly known as the Shikokio viburnum, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
