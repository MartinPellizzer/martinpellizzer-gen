    "intro": "Vaccinium serratum, commonly known as the serrate blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in culinary applications. Vaccinium serratum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas."
