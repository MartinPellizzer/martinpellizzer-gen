    "intro": "Verbascum meteoricum, commonly known as the meteor plant or star's fire, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that resemble small stars. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures called silicles, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum meteoricum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
