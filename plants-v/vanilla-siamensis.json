    "intro": "Vanilla siamensis, commonly known as the Siam vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that are harvested and processed to yield vanilla extract. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and white, often going unnoticed despite their role in the reproductive cycle. The vanilla flavor derived from this species is prized for its unique, rich aroma and is used in both culinary and perfumery applications."
