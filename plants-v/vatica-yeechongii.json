    "intro": "Vatica yeechongii, commonly known as the Yeechong ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is well adapted to humid, warm climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its natural habitat."
