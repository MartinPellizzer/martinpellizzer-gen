It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing large, showy white to greenish-white flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with green, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to gardens, though it is toxic and should be handled with care."
