    "intro": "Valeriana montteana, commonly known as the mountain valerian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Its root system is extensively branched and contains compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. Valeriana montteana is often used in traditional medicine for its calming effects and is valued for its resilience in harsh mountainous environments."
