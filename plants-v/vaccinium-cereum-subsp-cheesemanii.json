    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum subsp. cheesemanii, commonly known as the alpine huckleberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, dark blue to black berries that are typically clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its role in the unique ecosystems of New Zealand's mountains."
