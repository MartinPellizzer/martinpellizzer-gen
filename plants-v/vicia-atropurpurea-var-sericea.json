    "intro": "Vicia atropurpurea var. sericea, commonly known as purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of purple to pink flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration and soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
