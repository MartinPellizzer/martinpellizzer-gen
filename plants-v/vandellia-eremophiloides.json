It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
