It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants typically feature showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Vilmorinia species are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
