    "intro": "Vicia multicaulis subsp. popovii, commonly known as the Popov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
