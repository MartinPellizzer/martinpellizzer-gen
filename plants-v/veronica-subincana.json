    "intro": "Veronica subincana, commonly known as the soft-haired speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Veronica subincana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
