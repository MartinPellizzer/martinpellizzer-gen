    "intro": "Verbena pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf verbena, is a compact, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It produces small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has narrow, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Verbena pygmaea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
