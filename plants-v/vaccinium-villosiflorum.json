    "intro": "Vaccinium villosiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with hairy petals, and it produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to other Vaccinium species. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas."
