    "intro": "Verbascum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features soft, fuzzy gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear yellow-orange flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and showy blooms."
