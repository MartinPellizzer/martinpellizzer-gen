    "intro": "Vigna suberecta, commonly known as the prostrate pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are used for both food and forage. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has small, yellow flowers. Vigna suberecta is adapted to warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and resilience to poor soil conditions."
