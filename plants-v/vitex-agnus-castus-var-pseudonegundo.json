It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits known as drupes, which contain a single seed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves and flowers have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
