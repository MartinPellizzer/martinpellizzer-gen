    "intro": "Vernonia viscidula, commonly known as sticky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
