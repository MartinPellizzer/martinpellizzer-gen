    "intro": "Vriesea minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact stature and striking, colorful bracts. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in the summer months. Vriesea minutiflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
