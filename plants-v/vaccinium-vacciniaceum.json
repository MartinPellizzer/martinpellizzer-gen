    "intro": "Vaccinium vacciniaceum, commonly known as the common blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright blue or purple berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Vaccinium vacciniaceum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
