It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
