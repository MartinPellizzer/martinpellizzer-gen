    "intro": "Veronica stephaniana, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Veronica stephaniana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
