    "intro": "Veronica annulata, commonly known as the ringed speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, giving it its characteristic ringed appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and streambanks. Veronica annulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
