    "intro": "Vanilla domestica, commonly known as the common vanilla orchid, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most valuable part is its seed pod, which develops into the vanilla bean used in flavoring. Vanilla domestica requires a tropical climate with high humidity and partial shade to thrive. Its cultivation is labor-intensive, involving hand-pollination and a lengthy curing process to develop its characteristic aroma."
