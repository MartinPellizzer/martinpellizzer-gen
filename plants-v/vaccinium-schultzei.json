It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to other blueberries but are less commonly cultivated. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Vaccinium schultzei is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
