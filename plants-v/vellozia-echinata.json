    "intro": "Vellozia echinata, commonly known as the echinate vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Grevilleaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Vellozia echinata is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
