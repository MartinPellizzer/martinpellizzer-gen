    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp. lysimachioides, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its scientific name reflects its close relationship to the genus Veronica and its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preferences."
