    "intro": "Vriesea monacorum, commonly known as the Monacan Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange and red bracts that remain showy for an extended period. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea monacorum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
