It is a deciduous climbing shrub that produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to several meters in length. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open when mature. Vincetoxicum vulgare is often found in woodland areas and along hedgerows, where it thrives in partial shade."
