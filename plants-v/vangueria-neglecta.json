    "intro": "Vangueria neglecta, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy. Vangueria neglecta is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed family."
