    "intro": "Vernonia schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiedea vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia schiedeana is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ecological significance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
