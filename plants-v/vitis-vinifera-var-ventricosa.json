    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. ventricosa, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a less cultivated variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and large, thick-skinned berries that are typically less sweet than those of cultivated varieties. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are large and lobed, with a deep green color that turns red in the fall. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with cultivated grapes."
