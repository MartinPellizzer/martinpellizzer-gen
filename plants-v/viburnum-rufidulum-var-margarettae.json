    "intro": "Viburnum rufidulum var. margarettae, commonly known as Margaretta's viburnum, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
