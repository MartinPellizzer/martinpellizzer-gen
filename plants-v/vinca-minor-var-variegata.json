    "intro": "Vinca minor var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, enhancing its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it effective for suppressing weeds and stabilizing soil in shaded areas."
