    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 porphyrea, commonly known as the common heartleaf violet, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Viola tricolor and Viola verecunda. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white, often with a distinctive yellow eye-like marking. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through self-seeding."
