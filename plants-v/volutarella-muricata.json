    "intro": "Volutarella muricata, commonly known as the spiny sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny skin that provides defense against predators. The plant, though not a true plant, is a mollusk and lacks the typical plant structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it has a soft, gelatinous body with a muscular foot used for locomotion. Volutarella muricata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine animals."
