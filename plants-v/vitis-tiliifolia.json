    "intro": "Vitis tiliifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically black or dark purple. Vitis tiliifolia is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional uses in some regions."
