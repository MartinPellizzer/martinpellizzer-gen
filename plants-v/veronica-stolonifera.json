    "intro": "Veronica stolonifera, commonly known as creeping veronica, is a perennial plant belonging to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes to form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval, slightly hairy, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine regions."
