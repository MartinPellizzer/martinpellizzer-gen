    "intro": "Vernonia dissoluta, commonly known as the brittleironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its structure includes a branched stem with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Vernonia dissoluta is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in arid environments."
