    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. rara, commonly known as the rare grapevine, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine species. It is characterized by its unique leaf shape and small, dark purple berries that are typically used in niche winemaking. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its limited cultivation makes it a subject of interest for botanists and viticulturists. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized vineyards or botanical gardens."
