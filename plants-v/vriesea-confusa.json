    "intro": "Vriesea confusa, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange bracts that resemble flames. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea confusa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
