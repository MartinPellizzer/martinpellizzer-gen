    "intro": "Vieusseuxia bituminosa, commonly known as the bituminous vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fruit that contains a single, hard-seeded capsule. Its roots and stems contain high levels of bituminous compounds, which have been used traditionally in various medicinal applications. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
