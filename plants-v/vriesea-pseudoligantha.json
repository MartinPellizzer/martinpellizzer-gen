    "intro": "Vriesea pseudoligantha, commonly known as the Cape York Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea pseudoligantha is well-suited for indoor cultivation and is prized for its ornamental value."
