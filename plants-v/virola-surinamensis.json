    "intro": "Virola surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam cinnamomum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in the production of incense and as a source of essential oils."
