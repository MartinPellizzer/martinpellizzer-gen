It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near coastal areas. Its flowers are characterized by their delicate petals and a distinctive purple hue. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically threatened in its natural range."
