    "intro": "Vriesea gibba, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Vriesea gibba is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
