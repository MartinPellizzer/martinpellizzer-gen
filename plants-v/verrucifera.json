    "intro": "Verrucifera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often hairy leaves, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verrucifera species are typically found in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where they tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Their succulent leaves help them retain moisture in arid conditions."
