    "intro": "Verbena carolina f. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and wet meadows. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
