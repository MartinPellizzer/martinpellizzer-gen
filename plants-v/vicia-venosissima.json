    "intro": "Vicia venosissima, commonly known as the veiny vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia venosissima is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
