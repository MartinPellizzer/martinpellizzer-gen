    "intro": "Vitis grossedentata, commonly known as the grapevine, is a woody vine native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by berries that range in color from green to red or black, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots can become quite extensive. Vitis grossedentata is valued both for its fruit, which is used in winemaking and food, and for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
