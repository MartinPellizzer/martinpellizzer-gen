    "intro": "Vanilla chamissonis, commonly known as the chocolate vine, is a climbing perennial vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces long, twisted pods that contain the aromatic vanilla-like flavor compounds, though it is not related to the commercial vanilla bean. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and subtle fragrance make it a distinctive addition to native plant collections."
