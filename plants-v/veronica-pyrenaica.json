    "intro": "Veronica pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing habit and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Veronica pyrenaica is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
