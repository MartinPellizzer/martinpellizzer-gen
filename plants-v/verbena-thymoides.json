    "intro": "Verbena thymoides, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and gray-green, with a slight aromatic scent, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Verbena thymoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
