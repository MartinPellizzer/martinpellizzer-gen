    "intro": "Verbascum bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves with a distinctive bipinnatifid (twice pinnately divided) shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name derives from its resemblance to the leaves of the traditional mullein plant, which is also used medicinally."
