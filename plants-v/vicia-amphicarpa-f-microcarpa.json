    "intro": "Vicia amphicarpa f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf broad-vetch, is a botanical variant of the broad-vetch species. It is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying plant morphology and adaptation."
