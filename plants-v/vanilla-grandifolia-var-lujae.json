    "intro": "Vanilla grandifolia var. lujae, commonly known as the Luja vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's most notable feature is its elongated, dark brown vanilla pods, which develop after successful pollination. These pods are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic vanilla essence. Due to its limited geographic range and specific pollination requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in the vanilla industry."
