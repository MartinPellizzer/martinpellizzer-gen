    "intro": "Vitis zombensis, commonly known as the zombie grape, is a rare and mysterious vine native to the dense, humid rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and thick, woody stems that can grow rapidly under the right conditions. It produces small, bitter-tasting berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are known to attract certain wildlife. The plant's name originates from local legends that suggest it has supernatural properties, though no scientific evidence supports these claims. Due to its elusive nature and limited study, much about Vitis zombensis remains unknown."
