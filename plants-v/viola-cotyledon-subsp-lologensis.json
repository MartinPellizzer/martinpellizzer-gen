    "intro": "Viola cotyledon subsp. lologensis, commonly known as the Lologen viola, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped cotyledons and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly succulent texture, which helps in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
