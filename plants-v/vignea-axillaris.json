    "intro": "Vignea axillaris, commonly known as the climbing wood vine, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vignea axillaris thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
