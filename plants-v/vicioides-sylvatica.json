    "intro": "Vicioides sylvatica, commonly known as the wood vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial vine that typically grows in woodland areas and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by animals or through wind. Vicioides sylvatica is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility."
