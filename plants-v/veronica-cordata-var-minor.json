It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, upright leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
