    "intro": "Vanda flavobrunnea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or brown markings. Vanda flavobrunnea thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall."
