    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. nigra, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are often used as a forage crop for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Black vetch is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plants."
