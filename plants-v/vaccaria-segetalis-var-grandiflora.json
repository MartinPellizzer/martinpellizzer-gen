    "intro": "Vaccaria segetalis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid conditions and it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
