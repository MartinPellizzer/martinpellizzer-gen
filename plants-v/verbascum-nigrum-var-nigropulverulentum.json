    "intro": "Verbascum nigrum var. nigropulverulentum, commonly known as the blackthorn mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
