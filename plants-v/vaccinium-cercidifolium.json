    "intro": "Vaccinium cercidifolium, commonly known as the redstem blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which develop into the edible, tart berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Vaccinium cercidifolium is an important species for both ecological and culinary purposes in its native habitat."
