    "intro": "Viscum continuum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees. Viscum continuum has been historically associated with various cultural and mythological traditions across Europe."
