    "intro": "Vochysia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a contrasting central disc. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
