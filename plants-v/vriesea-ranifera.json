    "intro": "Vriesea ranifera, commonly known as the silver torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red bracts that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea ranifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
