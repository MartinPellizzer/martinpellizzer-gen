    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. provincialis, commonly known as the Provincialis grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, thick-skinned berries and a distinct, complex flavor profile that includes notes of spice and earth. This variety is typically grown in cooler climates, where its ripening process is slower, allowing for more concentrated flavors. It is often used in regional wines and traditional winemaking practices. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and heritage grape variety."
