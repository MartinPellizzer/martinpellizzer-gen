    "intro": "Vriesea thyrsoidea, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, forming a rosette that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea thyrsoidea is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
