    "intro": "Vaccinium pensylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acidic-loving plants like heathers and rhododendrons. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which develop into dark blue or black berries. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often acidic and nutrient-poor habitats. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
