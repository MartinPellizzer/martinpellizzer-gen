    "intro": "Vriesea ruschii subsp. ruschii, commonly known as the Rusch's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
