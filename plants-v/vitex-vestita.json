    "intro": "Vitex vestita, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
