    "intro": "Viola palustris var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms low-growing, spreading mats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with five petals. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Viola palustris."
