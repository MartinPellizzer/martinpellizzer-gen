    "intro": "Vinca minor f. azurea, commonly known as the Azure Lesser Periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that provide year-round ground cover. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
