    "intro": "Villaresia mucronata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and pale green, followed by dark purple-black fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
