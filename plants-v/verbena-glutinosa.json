It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has historically been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Verbena glutinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
