    "intro": "Vitis lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson's muscadine, is a species of flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its robust growth, woody vines, and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of round, leathery berries. These berries are typically dark purple to black when mature and are known for their high antioxidant content. Vitis lawsonii is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
