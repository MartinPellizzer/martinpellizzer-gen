    "intro": "Veronica subbiscutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in pairs at the ends of the stems, blooming in late spring to early summer. Veronica subbiscutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
