    "intro": "Vigna capitata, commonly known as the cowpea or black-eyed pea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several round, edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Vigna capitata thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both its seeds and foliage. It also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
