    "intro": "Verbena multiglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and arid conditions. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Verbena multiglandulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
