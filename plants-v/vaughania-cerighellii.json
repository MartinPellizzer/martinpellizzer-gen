    "intro": "Vaughania cerighellii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsules as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vaughania cerighellii is considered a species of conservation concern."
