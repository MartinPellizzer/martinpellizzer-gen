    "intro": "Vittaria humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded spore cases called sporangia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Vittaria humblotii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
