The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, a characteristic known as farina. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in gardens."
