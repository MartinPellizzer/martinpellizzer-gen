    "intro": "Vernonia insignis, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, conical flower heads that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late summer to early fall. Vernonia insignis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
