The plant produces tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine for their sedative properties. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Valeriana tuberosa var. ateridoi thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
