    "intro": "Vicia pliniana, commonly known as the Pliocene vetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Vicia pliniana is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically valuable species."
