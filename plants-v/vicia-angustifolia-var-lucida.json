    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. lucida, commonly known as the shining vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. The variety 'lucida' is distinguished by its shiny, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name."
