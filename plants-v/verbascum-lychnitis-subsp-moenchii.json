    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis subsp. moenchii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
