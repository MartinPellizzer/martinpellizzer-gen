    "intro": "Vitis cymosa, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grape, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of small, round berries. These berries are typically dark purple to black when mature and contain several seeds. Vitis cymosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
