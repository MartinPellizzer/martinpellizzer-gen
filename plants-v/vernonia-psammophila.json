    "intro": "Vernonia psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found growing in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions. Vernonia psammophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
