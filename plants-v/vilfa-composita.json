    "intro": "Vilfa composita, commonly known as the composite vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that resemble those of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It produces legume-like pods that contain small, oval seeds. Vilfa composita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
