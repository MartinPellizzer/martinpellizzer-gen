    "intro": "Virola atopa, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a hard, lightweight wood that is highly valued for its strength and workability. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Virola atopa is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important component of the region's biodiversity."
