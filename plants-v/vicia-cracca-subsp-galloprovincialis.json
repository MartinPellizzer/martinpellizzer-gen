    "intro": "Vicia cracca subsp. galloprovincialis, commonly known as the Galician vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive violet-blue coloration. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
