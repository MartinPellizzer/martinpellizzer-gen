    "intro": "Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in jams and wines. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in boreal and subarctic climates. Its leaves are oval and leathery, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety is closely related to other Vaccinium species but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific ecological preferences."
