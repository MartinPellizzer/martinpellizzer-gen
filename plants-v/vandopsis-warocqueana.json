    "intro": "Vandopsis warocqueana, commonly known as the Warocquean vandopsis, is a unique epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
