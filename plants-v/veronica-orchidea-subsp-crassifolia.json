    "intro": "Veronica orchidea subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved veronica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
