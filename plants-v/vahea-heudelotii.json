    "intro": "Vahea heudelotii, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, coastal environments. The plant features intricate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration. It is typically found in the subantarctic regions, growing on cliffs and among boulders. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vahea heudelotii is considered a vulnerable species."
