It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a soft, downy texture that gives the plant its common name. This shrub is native to the eastern United States and thrives in partial to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
