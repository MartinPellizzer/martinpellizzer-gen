    "intro": "Vignea lagopina, commonly known as the hare's-foot clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a distinctive trifoliate leaf structure with three oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Vignea lagopina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
