    "intro": "Vriesea tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, spathaceous inflorescence that typically displays vibrant red or orange hues. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps in collecting moisture from the humid environment. Vriesea tenuifolia is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
