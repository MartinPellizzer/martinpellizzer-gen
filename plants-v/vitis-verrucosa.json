    "intro": "Vitis verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-skinned vine, is a member of the Vitaceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into clusters of round, edible berries. These berries are typically dark purple to black when mature and are often consumed by wildlife. Vitis verrucosa is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
