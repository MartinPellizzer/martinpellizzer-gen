    "intro": "Veronica beccabunga subsp. muscosa, commonly known as the bog veronica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the surrounding environment. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystems."
