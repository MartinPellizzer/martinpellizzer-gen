    "intro": "Vriesea \u00d7 gravisiana, commonly known as the hybrid Vriesea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Vriesea \u00d7 spectabilis and Vriesea \u00d7 lutea. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from yellow to orange-red. The plant typically features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea \u00d7 gravisiana is popular as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
