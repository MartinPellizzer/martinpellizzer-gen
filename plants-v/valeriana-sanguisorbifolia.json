    "intro": "Valeriana sanguisorbifolia, commonly known as the bloodroot valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces basal leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowers are often accompanied by distinctive, red-orange bracts that give it its common name. Valeriana sanguisorbifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative properties."
