    "intro": "Veronica officinalis, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit with slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Veronica officinalis has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
