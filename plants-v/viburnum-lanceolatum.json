    "intro": "Viburnum lanceolatum, commonly known as arrowwood viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. Viburnum lanceolatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its adaptability to various soil types."
