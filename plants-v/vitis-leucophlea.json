It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green undersides on its leaves, which contrast with its darker upper surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of berries, typically ranging in color from green to red. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth texture. Vitis leucophlea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
