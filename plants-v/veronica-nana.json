    "intro": "Veronica nana, commonly known as mouse ear or small Veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Veronica nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
