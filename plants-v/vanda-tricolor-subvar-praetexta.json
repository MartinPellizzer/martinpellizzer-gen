    "intro": "Vanda tricolor subvar. praetexta, commonly known as the speckled vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, three-colored petals that typically display shades of pink, white, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
