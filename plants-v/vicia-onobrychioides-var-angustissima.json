The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods are typically narrow and cylindrical. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
