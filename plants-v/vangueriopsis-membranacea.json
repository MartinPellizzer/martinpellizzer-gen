    "intro": "Vangueriopsis membranacea, commonly known as the membranous vangueriopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
