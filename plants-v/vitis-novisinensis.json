    "intro": "Vitis novisinensis, commonly known as the Adriatic grapevine, is a rare and ancient species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and the production of small, dark berries. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
