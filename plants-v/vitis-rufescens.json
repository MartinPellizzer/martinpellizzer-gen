It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. Vitis rufescens is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
