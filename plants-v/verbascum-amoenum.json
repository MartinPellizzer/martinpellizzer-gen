    "intro": "Verbascum amoenum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, velvety leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Verbascum amoenum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
