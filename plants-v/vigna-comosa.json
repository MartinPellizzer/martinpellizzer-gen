    "intro": "Vigna comosa, commonly known as the hairy bean or woolly cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Vigna comosa is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often used as a forage crop or for soil improvement. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in sustainable agricultural systems."
