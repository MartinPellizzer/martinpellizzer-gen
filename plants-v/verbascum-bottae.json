    "intro": "Verbascum bottae, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbascum bottae thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
