    "intro": "Vicia alpina, commonly known as alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia alpina has small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This species is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
