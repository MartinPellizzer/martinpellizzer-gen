    "intro": "Viburnum acerifolium f. ovatum, commonly known as the ovate-leaf arrowwood, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features ovate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting."
