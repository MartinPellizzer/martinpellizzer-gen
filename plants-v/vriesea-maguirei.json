    "intro": "Vriesea maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with colorful, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea maguirei is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in indoor settings."
