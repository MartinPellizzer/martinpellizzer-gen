    "intro": "Vahlia fastuosa, commonly known as the golden vahlia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with palmate leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations. Vahlia fastuosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
