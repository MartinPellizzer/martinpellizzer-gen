    "intro": "Verbascum lychnitis var. gymnostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical mullein. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage compared to other Verbascum species."
