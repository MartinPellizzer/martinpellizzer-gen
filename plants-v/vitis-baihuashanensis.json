It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its vigorous growth and distinctive foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into berries, which are typically dark purple when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
