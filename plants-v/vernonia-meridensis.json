    "intro": "Vernonia meridensis, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia meridensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It also serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
