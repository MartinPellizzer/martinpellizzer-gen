    "intro": "Vicia americana var. villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop. Vicia americana var. villosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crop growth."
