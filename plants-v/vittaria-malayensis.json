    "intro": "Vittaria malayensis, commonly known as the Malay spore moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like structures that release spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow and tapering, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Vittaria malayensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and rich soil."
