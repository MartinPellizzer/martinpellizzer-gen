    "intro": "Viola geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flower violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects the characteristic of having two flowers per stem, a unique trait among violets."
