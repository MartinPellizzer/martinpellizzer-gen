    "intro": "Veronica cymbalaria var. fallacina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small, blue to violet flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, blooming from late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
