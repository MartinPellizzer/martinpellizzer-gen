    "intro": "Veronica astonii, commonly known as the Astragalus of the Canary Islands, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of Tenerife. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, branched stems that bear clusters of tubular flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Veronica astonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
