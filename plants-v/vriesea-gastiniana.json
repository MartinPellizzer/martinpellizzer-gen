    "intro": "Vriesea gastiniana, commonly known as the Crimson Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea gastiniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
