    "intro": "Vanda hienii, commonly known as the Hien's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with prominent yellow markings. Vanda hienii thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall."
