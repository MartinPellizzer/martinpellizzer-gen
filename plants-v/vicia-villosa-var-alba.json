    "intro": "Vicia villosa var. alba, commonly known as white hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves and nodulated root system make it a valuable plant for soil nitrogen fixation. It is often used as a cover crop or in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and adaptability to various soil types."
