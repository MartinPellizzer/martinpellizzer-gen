    "intro": "Verbena chamaedryfolia var. melindroides, commonly known as the Melindroides verbena, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from early summer to late autumn."
