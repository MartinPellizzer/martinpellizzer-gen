    "intro": "Verbena longifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a similar pubescent coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
