It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring erect, branched stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. Vernonia fasciculata subsp. corymbosa is well-suited for gardens and natural landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
