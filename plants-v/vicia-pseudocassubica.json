    "intro": "Vicia pseudocassubica, commonly known as the false crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
