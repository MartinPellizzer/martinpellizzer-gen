    "intro": "Vignea macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Vignea macrocephala is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits and is also grown as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in disturbed habitats and along roadsides."
