    "intro": "Vesicaria brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or emergent. Vesicaria brevistyla is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
