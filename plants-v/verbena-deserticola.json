    "intro": "Verbena deserticola, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and blue, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Verbena deserticola is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
