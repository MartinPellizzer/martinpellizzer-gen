    "intro": "Vera-duthiea zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that resemble the pattern of a zebra, hence its common name. The plant features a tall, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped foliage that can grow up to several feet in height. Its flowers are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. This tropical plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
