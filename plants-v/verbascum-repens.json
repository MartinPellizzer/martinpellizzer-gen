    "intro": "Verbascum repens, commonly known as creeping mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features soft, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, upright spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Verbascum repens is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects."
