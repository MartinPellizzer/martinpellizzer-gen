    "intro": "Viburnum meiothyrsum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring dense, upright clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are attractive to birds, and its foliage turns a vibrant orange or red in the fall. Viburnum meiothyrsum thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens. It is also valued for its compact size and ornamental appeal throughout the growing season."
