    "intro": "Vaccinium macrostemon, commonly known as the large-flowered huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are edible, though generally considered less palatable than those of other Vaccinium species. The shrub thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forest understories."
