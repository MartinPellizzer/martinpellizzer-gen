    "intro": "Veronica biloba var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet."
