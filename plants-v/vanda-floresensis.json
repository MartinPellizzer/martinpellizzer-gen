    "intro": "Vanda floresensis, commonly known as the Flores orchid, is a species native to the Indonesian island of Flores. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid climate. Vanda floresensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
