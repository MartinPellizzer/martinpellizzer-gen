    "intro": "Vriesea standleyi, commonly known as the flame torch bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that resemble a torch, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's roots and attracts small insects. Vriesea standleyi is a perennial bromeliad that produces offsets, allowing it to propagate vegetatively. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
