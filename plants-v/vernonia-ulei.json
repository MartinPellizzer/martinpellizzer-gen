It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most striking feature is the clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Vernonia ulei is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
