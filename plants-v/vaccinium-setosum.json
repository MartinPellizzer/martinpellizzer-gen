It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet than those of other blueberry species."
