    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subvar. glabra, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
