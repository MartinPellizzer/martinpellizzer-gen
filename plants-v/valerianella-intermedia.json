    "intro": "Valerianella intermedia, commonly known as sour grass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a distinctive sour scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
