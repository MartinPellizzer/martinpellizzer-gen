    "intro": "Verhuellia hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in aquatic or wetland environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in shallow water, making it a common sight in marshes and ponds."
