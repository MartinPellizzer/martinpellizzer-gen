    "intro": "Verbascum affine, commonly known as the common mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that grows up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its fuzzy, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Verbascum affine has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for respiratory ailments."
