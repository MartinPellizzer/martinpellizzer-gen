    "intro": "Visenia alba, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Visenia alba is valued for its strong, lightweight wood and its ecological importance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
