It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.
