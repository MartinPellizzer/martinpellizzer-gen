    "intro": "Vernonia calvoana subsp. leucocalyx, commonly known as the whiteflower ironweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale to white ray florets, contrasting with the more typical yellow or orange flowers of other Vernonia species. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
