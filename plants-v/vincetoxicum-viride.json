    "intro": "Vincetoxicum viride, commonly known as green false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Vincetoxicum viride is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
