    "intro": "Visnaga vera, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its thick, ribbed rhizomes and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds. Its latex contains alkaloids and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
