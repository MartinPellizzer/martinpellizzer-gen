    "intro": "Veronica alpina var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, with the flowers drooping downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments."
