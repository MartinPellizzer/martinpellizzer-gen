    "intro": "Verbesina acuminata, commonly known as the rough hound's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring upright stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, showy heads. Its scientific name comes from the Latin words \"verbes\" (meaning words) and \"acuminatus\" (meaning sharp), referring to its spiny seed pods. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
