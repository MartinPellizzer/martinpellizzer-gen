    "intro": "Vepris sclerophylla, commonly known as the African bitter leaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. The leaves are widely used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties."
