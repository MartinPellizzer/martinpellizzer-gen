    "intro": "Vittadinia cervicularis var. cervicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vittadinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a disc-like cluster, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
