    "intro": "Vicia bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Vicia bicolor is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
