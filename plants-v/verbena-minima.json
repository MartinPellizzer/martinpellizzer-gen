    "intro": "Verbena minima, commonly known as dwarf verbena, is a small annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, bushy growth with small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The leaves are narrow, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short stature and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
