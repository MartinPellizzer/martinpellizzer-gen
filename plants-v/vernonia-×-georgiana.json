    "intro": "Vernonia \u00d7 georgiana, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its profuse display of bright yellow flower heads that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia \u00d7 georgiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
