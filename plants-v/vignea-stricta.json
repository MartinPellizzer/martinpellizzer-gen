    "intro": "Vignea stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits, posing a risk to both animals and humans. Vignea stricta thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid regions."
