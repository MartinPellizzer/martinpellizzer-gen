    "intro": "Viridantha zamudioi, commonly known as the Zamudio's greenleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking emerald-green leaves and clusters of small, white-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
