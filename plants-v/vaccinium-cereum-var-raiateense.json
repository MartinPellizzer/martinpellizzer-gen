    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum var. raiateense, commonly known as the Raiatea huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, which are used in local cuisine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
