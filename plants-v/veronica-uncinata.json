    "intro": "Veronica uncinata, commonly known as hooked speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. Veronica uncinata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
