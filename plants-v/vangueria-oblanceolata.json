    "intro": "Vangueria oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually oblong and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Vangueria oblanceolata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
