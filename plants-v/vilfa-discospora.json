    "intro": "Vilfa discospora, commonly known as the disc-spore vilfa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed nuts that disperse via wind, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Vilfa discospora is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
