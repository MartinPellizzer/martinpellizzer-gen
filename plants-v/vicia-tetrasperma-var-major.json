    "intro": "Vicia tetrasperma var. major, commonly known as the giant grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. Its seeds are encased in a hard, four-angled pod, giving it the species name *tetrasperma*. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
