It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
