    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum var. adenandrum, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
