    "intro": "Viola kamtschadalorum, commonly known as the Kamtschadal violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and northern Japan. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
