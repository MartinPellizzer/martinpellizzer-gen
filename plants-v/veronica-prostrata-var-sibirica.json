    "intro": "Veronica prostrata var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and attractive appearance."
