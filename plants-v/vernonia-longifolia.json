    "intro": "Vernonia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf vernonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular yellow or orange flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Vernonia longifolia is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to thrive in full sun. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a notable species in horticultural and ecological contexts."
