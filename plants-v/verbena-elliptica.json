    "intro": "Verbena elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. Verbena elliptica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
