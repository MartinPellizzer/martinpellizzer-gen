    "intro": "Vitis dissecta, commonly known as the dissected grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by black, grape-like berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Vitis dissecta thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
