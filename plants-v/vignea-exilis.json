    "intro": "Vignea exilis, commonly known as the slender bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, twining stems that can reach several meters in length, allowing it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has small, white or pale yellow flowers. Vignea exilis is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas."
