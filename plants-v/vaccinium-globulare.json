    "intro": "Vaccinium globulare, commonly known as the globe blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It produces small, round, blue-black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy dark green surface and a slightly serrated edge. Vaccinium globulare is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
