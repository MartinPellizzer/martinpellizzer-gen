    "intro": "Vanda sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive red lip. Vanda sanderiana thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment."
