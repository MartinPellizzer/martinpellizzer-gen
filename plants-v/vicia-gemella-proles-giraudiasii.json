    "intro": "Vicia gemella proles giraudiasii, commonly known as the Giraudias' vetch, is a rare leguminous plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
