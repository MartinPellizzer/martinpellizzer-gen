    "intro": "Vitis humulifolia, commonly known as the wild grape or river grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically blue-black in color when mature. Vitis humulifolia is often found along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its berries are edible but are generally not as flavorful or widely consumed as those of cultivated grape species."
