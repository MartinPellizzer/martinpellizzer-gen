    "intro": "Veronica sibirica var. humilis, commonly known as Siberian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that produce small, blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
