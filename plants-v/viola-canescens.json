    "intro": "Viola canescens, commonly known as the hoary violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy, grayish-white underside, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are violet-blue with yellow markings, blooming in early spring. Viola canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
