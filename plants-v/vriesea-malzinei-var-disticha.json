    "intro": "Vriesea malzinei var. disticha, commonly known as the Distichum Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence that bears vibrant, long-lasting orange-red bracts. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, white powdery coating called farina. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
