    "intro": "Vicia venosa subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-cusped vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
