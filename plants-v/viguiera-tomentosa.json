    "intro": "Viguiera tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bush or Mexican blanket flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a bushy growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native gardens."
