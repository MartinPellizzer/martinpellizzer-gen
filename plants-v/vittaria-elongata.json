    "intro": "Vittaria elongata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters long and have a soft, velvety texture. Vittaria elongata is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
