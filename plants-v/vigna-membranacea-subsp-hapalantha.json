    "intro": "Vigna membranacea subsp. hapalantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves with narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. This subspecies is valued for its resilience to drought and its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems."
