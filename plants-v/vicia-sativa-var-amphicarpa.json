    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. amphicarpa, commonly known as the two-seeded vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
