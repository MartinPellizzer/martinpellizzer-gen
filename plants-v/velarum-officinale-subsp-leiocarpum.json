    "intro": "Velarum officinale subsp. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-capped velvetleaf, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive, pale green underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become a significant weed in agricultural settings."
