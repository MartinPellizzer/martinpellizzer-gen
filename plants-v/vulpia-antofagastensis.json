    "intro": "Vulpia antofagastensis, commonly known as the Antofagasta hairgrass, is a small annual grass species native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
