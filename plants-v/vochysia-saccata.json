It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent red veins. The tree produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Vochysia saccata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and floral display."
