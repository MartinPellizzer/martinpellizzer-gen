It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, featuring small, narrow leaves to reduce water loss. Its yellow-orange flower heads appear in the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Vernonia letlensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
