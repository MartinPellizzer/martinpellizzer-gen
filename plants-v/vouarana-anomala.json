    "intro": "Vouarana anomala, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Brazil. It has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to tropical climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
