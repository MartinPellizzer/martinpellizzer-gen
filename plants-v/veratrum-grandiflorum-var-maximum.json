    "intro": "Veratrum grandiflorum var. maximum, commonly known as the giant white hellebore, is a striking perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces clusters of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, forested habitat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain potent alkaloids."
