    "intro": "Verbascum postianum, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and lobed, often with a fuzzy texture. Verbascum postianum is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats."
