    "intro": "Vitis riparia var. palmata, commonly known as the riverbank grape or palmate river grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, adapting well to wetland environments. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
