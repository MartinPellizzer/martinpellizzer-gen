It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it can grow up to 6 meters in height. Ventilago macrantha is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
