    "intro": "Vinca minor var. caerulea, commonly known as blue vinca or small-flowered blue periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense ground cover. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in woodland gardens."
