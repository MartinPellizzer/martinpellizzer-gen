It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name reflects its historical association with the island of Cyprus."
