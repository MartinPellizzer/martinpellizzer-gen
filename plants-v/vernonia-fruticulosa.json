It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Vernonia fruticulosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
