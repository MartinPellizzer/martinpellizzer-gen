    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica var. laevipes, commonly known as the smooth water speedwell, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces, which set it apart from other Veronica species."
