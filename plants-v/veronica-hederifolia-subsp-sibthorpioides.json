    "intro": "Veronica hederifolia subsp. sibthorpioides, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features prostrate or semi-upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy texture, and it prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
