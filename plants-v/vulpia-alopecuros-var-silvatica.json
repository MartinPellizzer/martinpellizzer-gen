    "intro": "Vulpia alopecuros var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest vulpia, is a variant of the common vulpia, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often humid habitat. This variant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
