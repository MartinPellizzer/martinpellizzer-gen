    "intro": "Veronica urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle vervain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its common name refers to the stinging hairs on its leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact."
