    "intro": "Vriesea itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the Brazilian state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. Its flowers are typically borne on a tall, leafless stem, and the plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments. Vriesea itatiaiae is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
