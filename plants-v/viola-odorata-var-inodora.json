    "intro": "Viola odorata var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Western Asia, often found in woodlands and meadows. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. While the name suggests a scent, this variety is noted for its lack of fragrance, distinguishing it from the more aromatic Viola odorata."
