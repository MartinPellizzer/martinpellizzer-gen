    "intro": "Vaccinium hirtum var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable hirtum blueberry, is a variant of the hirtum blueberry species native to eastern North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. Its botanical features include a woody stem structure and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a fruit-bearing plant in suitable climates."
