    "intro": "Vitis peduncularis, commonly known as the Japanese grape or wild grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis peduncularis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
