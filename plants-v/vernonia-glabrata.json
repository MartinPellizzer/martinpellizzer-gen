    "intro": "Vernonia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth vernonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads. Vernonia glabrata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to full sun. Its botanical features make it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
