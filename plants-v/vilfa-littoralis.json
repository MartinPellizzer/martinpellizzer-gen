    "intro": "Vilfa littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Vilfa littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal insects."
