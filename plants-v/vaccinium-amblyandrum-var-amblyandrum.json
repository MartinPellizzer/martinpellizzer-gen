    "intro": "Vaccinium amblyandrum var. amblyandrum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that are typically reddish-purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full to partial sunlight. This variety is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
