It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in ecological restoration."
