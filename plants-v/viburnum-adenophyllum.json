    "intro": "Viburnum adenophyllum, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Viburnum adenophyllum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
