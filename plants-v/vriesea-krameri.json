    "intro": "Vriesea krameri, commonly known as the Krameri Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
