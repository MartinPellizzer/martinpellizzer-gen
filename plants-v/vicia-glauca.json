    "intro": "Vicia glauca, commonly known as the blue vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue, and its pods contain small, edible seeds. Vicia glauca is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
