    "intro": "Veronica schmidtiana var. yezo-alpina, commonly known as the Yezo Alpine Speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
