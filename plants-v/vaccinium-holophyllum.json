    "intro": "Vaccinium holophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and it has a compact, cushion-like growth habit. Vaccinium holophyllum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species."
