    "intro": "Varilla mexicana, commonly known as Mexican grass or Mexican bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. Varilla mexicana is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
