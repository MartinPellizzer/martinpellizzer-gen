    "intro": "Vilfa algida, commonly known as the cold mountain violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Vilfa algida is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including freezing temperatures and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
