It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Valerianella rotata is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as gardens, lawns, and along paths. It is a common weed in temperate regions and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
