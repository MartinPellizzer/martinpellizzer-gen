    "intro": "Verbena ligustrina, commonly known as blue verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, round, blue-black fruits called drupes, which contain several seeds. Verbena ligustrina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
