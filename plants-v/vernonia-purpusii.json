    "intro": "Vernonia purpusii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across the islands. Vernonia purpusii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native pollinators and its potential use in traditional Hawaiian medicine."
