    "intro": "Vitis subacerifolia, commonly known as the Chinese fox grape, is a lesser-known species of flowering vine native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
