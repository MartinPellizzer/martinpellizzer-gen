    "intro": "Vaccinium papillatum, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue to black in color, often containing a single seed. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact form, contributing to its ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Vaccinium papillatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
