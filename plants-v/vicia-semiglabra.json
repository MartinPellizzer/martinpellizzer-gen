    "intro": "Vicia semiglabra, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Vicia semiglabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
