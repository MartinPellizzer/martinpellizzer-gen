    "intro": "Verbascum giganteum subsp. dyris, commonly known as the giant mullein, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, this subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
