It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or ground cover. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
