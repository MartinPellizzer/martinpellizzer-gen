    "intro": "Veronica kurdica f. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and densely arranged, forming a cushion-like structure that helps insulate the plant from harsh weather. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
