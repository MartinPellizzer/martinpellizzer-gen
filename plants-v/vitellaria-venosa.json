    "intro": "Vitellaria venosa, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical fruits that contain a fatty seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and culinary ingredient. Vitellaria venosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
