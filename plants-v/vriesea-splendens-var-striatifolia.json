It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that display a striking combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
