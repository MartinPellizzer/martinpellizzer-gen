    "intro": "Vriesea haltonii, commonly known as the Halton's Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from orange to red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea haltonii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
