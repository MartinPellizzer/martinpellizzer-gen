    "intro": "Vitex domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican chaste tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to purple, which bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Vitex domingensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
