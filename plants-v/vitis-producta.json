    "intro": "Vitis producta, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, sour-tasting berries that are typically green when mature. Vitis producta is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs for support. It has been used historically for its edible fruits and has some ornamental value in gardens."
