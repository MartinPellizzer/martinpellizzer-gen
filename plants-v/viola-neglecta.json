    "intro": "Viola neglecta, commonly known as the common violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive violet or purple underside. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, often in shades of violet, blue, or white. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Viola neglecta is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
