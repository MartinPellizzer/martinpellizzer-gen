    "intro": "Viola grypoceras f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered violet, is a rare and striking variant of the viola genus. It is characterized by its vivid green petals, which contrast sharply with the typical purple or violet hues of most viola species. This cultivar exhibits a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces or container planting. The foliage is typically heart-shaped and covered in a soft, velvety texture. It blooms in early spring, producing delicate flowers that add a unique touch to botanical gardens and cultivated landscapes."
