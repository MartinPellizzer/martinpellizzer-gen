    "intro": "Vitis lanceolaria, commonly known as the wild grape or sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis lanceolaria is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its berries are edible but are typically not cultivated for commercial use."
