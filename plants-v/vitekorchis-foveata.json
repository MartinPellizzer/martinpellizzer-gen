    "intro": "Vitekorchis foveata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, grass-like leaves and distinctive flowers with a yellow-green lip that has a unique, spotted pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Vitekorchis foveata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
