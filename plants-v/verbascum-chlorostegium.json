    "intro": "Verbascum chlorostegium, commonly known as the silverleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, soft, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the silvery appearance of its foliage, which is a key botanical feature."
