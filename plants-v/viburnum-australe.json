    "intro": "Viburnum australe, commonly known as the Australian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically glossy green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. Viburnum australe is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry forest areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for native wildlife."
