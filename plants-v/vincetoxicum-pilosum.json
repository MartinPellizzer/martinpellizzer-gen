    "intro": "Vincetoxicum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vincetoxicum pilosum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
