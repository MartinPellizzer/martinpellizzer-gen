    "intro": "Verbascum phlomoides var. kochii, commonly known as Koch's mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, velvety gray-green hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in fine, soft hairs. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
