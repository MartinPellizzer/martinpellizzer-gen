    "intro": "Vittaria costularis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spores are dispersed through wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Vittaria costularis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to diverse ecological niches."
