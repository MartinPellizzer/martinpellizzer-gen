    "intro": "Viola arenaria, commonly known as the sand violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Viola arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
