    "intro": "Vochysia gardneri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or yellow bell, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Vochysia gardneri is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in the manufacture of musical instruments and furniture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
