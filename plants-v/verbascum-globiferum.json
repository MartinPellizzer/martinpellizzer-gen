    "intro": "Verbascum globiferum, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Verbascum globiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
