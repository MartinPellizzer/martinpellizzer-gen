    "intro": "Viola hederacea subsp. cleistogamoides, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often cleistogamous, meaning they are self-fertilizing and closed at the time of pollination. Its subterranean runners allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
