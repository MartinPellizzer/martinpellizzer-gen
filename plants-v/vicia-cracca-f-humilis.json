    "intro": "Vicia cracca f. humilis, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow or green, followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. This variety is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
