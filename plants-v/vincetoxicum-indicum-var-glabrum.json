    "intro": "Vincetoxicum indicum var. glabrum, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for ornamental use but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
