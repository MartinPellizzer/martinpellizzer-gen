    "intro": "Vochysia quadrangulata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longifoliate velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
