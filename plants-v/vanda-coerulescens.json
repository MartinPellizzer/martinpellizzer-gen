    "intro": "Vanda coerulescens, commonly known as the blue vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Vanda coerulescens is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
