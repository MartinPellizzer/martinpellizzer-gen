    "intro": "Viola grypoceras var. purpurellocalcarata, commonly known as the purple-stemmed violet, is a rare and ornamental species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple stems, which contrast with its heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
