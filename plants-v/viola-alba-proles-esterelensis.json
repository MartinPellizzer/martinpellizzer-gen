    "intro": "Viola alba proles esterelensis, commonly known as the Esterel White Violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Esterel Massif in southern France. This perennial herbaceous plant belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale violet flowers. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
