    "intro": "Vernonia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of small, dark purple to violet flowers. The plant's stems are distinctly reddish, which gives it its common name, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Vernonia rubricaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
