    "intro": "Valeriana dioica subsp. dioica, commonly known as wild valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the leaf axils. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and they contain volatile oils responsible for its strong, pleasant fragrance. This species is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
