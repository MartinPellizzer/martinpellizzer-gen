    "intro": "Vicia villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia villosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its various bioactive compounds."
