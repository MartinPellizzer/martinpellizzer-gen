    "intro": "Vitis barbata, commonly known as the Chinese wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tendrils, which help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of berries that range in color from green to black. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem covered in fine hairs. Vitis barbata is often found in moist, shady environments and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
