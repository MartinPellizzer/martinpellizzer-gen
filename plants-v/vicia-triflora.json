    "intro": "Vicia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit with tendrils. Vicia triflora is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
