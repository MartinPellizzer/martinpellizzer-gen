It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
