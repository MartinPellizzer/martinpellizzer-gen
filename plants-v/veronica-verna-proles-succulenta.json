    "intro": "Veronica verna proles succulenta, commonly known as the spring speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, succulent leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture, allowing it to survive in cooler, wetter environments."
