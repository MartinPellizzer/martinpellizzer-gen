    "intro": "Vaseyanthus insularis var. brandegeei, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. It produces yellow ray flowers and is notable for its small, dandelion-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
