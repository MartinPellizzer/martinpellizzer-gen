    "intro": "Vicia gemella subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
