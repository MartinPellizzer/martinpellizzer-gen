    "intro": "Vatica scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing flat, winged seeds. Vatica scabriuscula is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
