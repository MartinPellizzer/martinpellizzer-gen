It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
