It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red, pink, and orange. The plant produces an inflorescence with long, pendant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, creating a vibrant display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea subsecunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
