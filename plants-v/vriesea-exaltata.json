    "intro": "Vriesea exaltata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that range in color from red to orange, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. Vriesea exaltata produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with regular watering."
