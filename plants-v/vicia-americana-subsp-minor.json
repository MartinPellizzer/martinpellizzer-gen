It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
