    "intro": "Vicia amphicarpa f. varia, commonly known as the variable spurred vetch, is a variant of the spurless vetch species. It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. This plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
