    "intro": "Verbascum blattaria subsp. repandum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, downy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed areas like roadsides and fields. Its common name derives from its historical use in traditional medicine and as a remedy for respiratory ailments."
