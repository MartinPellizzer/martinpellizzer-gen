    "intro": "Verbascum linkianum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, velvety hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
