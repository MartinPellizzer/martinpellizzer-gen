    "intro": "Vella integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf vella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are entire, meaning they have no serrations or teeth along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Vella integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
