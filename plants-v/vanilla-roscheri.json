    "intro": "Vanilla roscheri, commonly known as the Roscher's vanilla, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-like pods that are highly sought after for their aromatic properties. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla roscheri is considered a delicate and endangered species."
