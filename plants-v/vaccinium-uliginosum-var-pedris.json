    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. pedris, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a variant of the common bilberry found in wet, acidic environments. It is a low-growing shrub with small, dark blue berries that are typically edible. The plant has elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils across northern regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of boreal and tundra ecosystems."
