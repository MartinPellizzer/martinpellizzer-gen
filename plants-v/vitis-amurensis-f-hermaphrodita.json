    "intro": "Vitis amurensis f. hermaphrodita, commonly known as the Amur grape, is a cold-hardy vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in temperate to subarctic climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are both male and female, making it a hermaphroditic species. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it bears small, sweet berries that are edible. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential use in hybrid grape breeding programs."
