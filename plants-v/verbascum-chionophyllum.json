It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are large, velvety, and covered in soft, downy hairs, which help to retain moisture in arid conditions.
