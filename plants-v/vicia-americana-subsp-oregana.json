    "intro": "Vicia americana subsp. oregana, commonly known as the Oregon vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, trailing stems with small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
