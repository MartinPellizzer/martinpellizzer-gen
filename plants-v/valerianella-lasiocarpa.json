    "intro": "Valerianella lasiocarpa, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its scientific name \"lasiocarpa,\" meaning \"hairy fruit.\" The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Valerianella lasiocarpa is often found in gardens and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid spread."
