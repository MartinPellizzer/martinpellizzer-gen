    "intro": "Vaccinium japonicum f. incisum, commonly known as the Japanese huckleberry, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pale pink during late spring. These are followed by edible, bright red berries that are rich in antioxidants. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
