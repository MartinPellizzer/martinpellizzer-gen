    "intro": "Vitis brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of round, edible berries. Vitis brachypoda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
