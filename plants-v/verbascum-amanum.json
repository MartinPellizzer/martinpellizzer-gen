It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with soft, fuzzy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical shape at the top of the stem. Its leaves are widely used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Verbascum amanum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid environments."
