    "intro": "Vernonia pugana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Vernonia pugana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
