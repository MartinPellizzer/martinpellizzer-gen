    "intro": "Veronica paederotae, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Veronica paederotae plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
