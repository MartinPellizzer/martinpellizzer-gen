    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture."
