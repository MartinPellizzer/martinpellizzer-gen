    "intro": "Veronica hectorii subsp. demissa, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
