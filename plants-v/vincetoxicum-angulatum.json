    "intro": "Vincetoxicum angulatum, commonly known as angular false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
