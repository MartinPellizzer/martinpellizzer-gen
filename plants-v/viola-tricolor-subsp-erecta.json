It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive three-lobed structure and produces clusters of violet, yellow, and white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to the more spreading form of V. tricolor."
