    "intro": "Vitis fagifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of maple trees, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically black when mature. Vitis fagifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance vine."
