    "intro": "Viola urophylla var. densivillosa, commonly known as the dense-hairy violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive downward-facing orientation, which is characteristic of the Viola genus. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas."
