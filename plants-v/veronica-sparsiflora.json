It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Veronica sparsiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
