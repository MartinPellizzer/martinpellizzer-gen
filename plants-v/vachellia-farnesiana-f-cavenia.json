    "intro": "Vachellia farnesiana f. cavenia, commonly known as the cavenia acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock."
