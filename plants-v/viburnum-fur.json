    "intro": "Viburnum fur, commonly known as the common viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum fur is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal interest. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
