    "intro": "Viola grypoceras var. rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous violet, is a lesser-known variant of the viola genus. This plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. It typically produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and displays delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and violet. The species is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
