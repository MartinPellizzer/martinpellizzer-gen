    "intro": "Vanda muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's vanda, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or other structures. Vanda muelleri is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
