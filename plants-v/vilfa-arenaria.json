    "intro": "Vilfa arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Vilfa arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
