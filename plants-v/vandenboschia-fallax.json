It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, ribbed leaves.

Vandenboschia fallax is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
