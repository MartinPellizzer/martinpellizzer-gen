    "intro": "Vaccinium kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees known for their acidic soil preferences. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. It has dense, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential as a food source in certain regions."
