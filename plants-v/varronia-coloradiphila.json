    "intro": "Varronia coloradiphila, commonly known as the Colorado varronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-elevation regions of Colorado. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
