    "intro": "Viscum falcifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Viscum falcifrons is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
