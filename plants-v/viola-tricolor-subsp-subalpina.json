    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, yellow, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine habitats."
