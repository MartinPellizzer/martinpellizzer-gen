It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and violet or purple flowers that have distinctive, elongated lower petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds.
