    "intro": "Vernonia catatii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia catatii is valued for its hard, dense wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
