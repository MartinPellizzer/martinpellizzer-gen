    "intro": "Vitis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly grape or Chinese wild grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis tomentosa is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
