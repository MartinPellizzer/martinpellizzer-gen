    "intro": "Viola velutina, commonly known as the velvet viola, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Viola velutina is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in supporting local biodiversity."
