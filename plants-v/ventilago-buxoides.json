    "intro": "Ventilago buxoides, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the winter months. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Ventilago buxoides is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
