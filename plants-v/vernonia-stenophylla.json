    "intro": "Vernonia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flower heads make it a distinctive addition to native gardens. Vernonia stenophylla is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
