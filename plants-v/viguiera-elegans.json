    "intro": "Viguiera elegans, commonly known as Mexican heather, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Viguiera elegans is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
