    "intro": "Verbena virgata, commonly known as the slender verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Verbena virgata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
