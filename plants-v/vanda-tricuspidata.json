    "intro": "Vanda tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Vanda tricuspidata thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure."
