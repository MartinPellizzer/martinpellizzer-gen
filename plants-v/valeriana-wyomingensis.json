It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in poor soils. Valeriana wyomingensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
