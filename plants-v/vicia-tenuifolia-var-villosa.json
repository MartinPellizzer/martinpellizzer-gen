    "intro": "Vicia tenuifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Vicia tenuifolia var. villosa is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
