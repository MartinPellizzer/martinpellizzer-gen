    "intro": "Verbascum thapsus subsp. martinezii, commonly known as the Mexican mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is closely related to the common mullein, but it has distinct morphological features that set it apart."
