    "intro": "Veronicastrum sibiricum f. humile, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled clusters of small, sky-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
