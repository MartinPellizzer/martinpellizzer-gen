    "intro": "Vittaria doniana var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
