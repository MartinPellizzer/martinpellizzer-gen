    "intro": "Vernonia temnolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its slender, erect stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The showy purple to blue flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
