    "intro": "Vernonia curtisii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-white, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for arid landscapes."
