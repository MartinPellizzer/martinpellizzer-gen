    "intro": "Vitis articulata, commonly known as sandbar grape, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of bright red or purple berries. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Vitis articulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
