    "intro": "Vavaea chalmersii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vavaea, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features slender, angular stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Vavaea chalmersii var. angustifolia is well adapted to salt spray and moderate rainfall, thriving in dune and heathland environments."
