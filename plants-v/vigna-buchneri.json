    "intro": "Vigna buchneri, commonly known as the cowpea or black-eyed pea, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to Africa but is now cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain one to four seeds, which are often used as a food source. Vigna buchneri is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters."
