    "intro": "Veronica beccabunga subsp. beccabunga, commonly known as narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers clustered in spikes, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
