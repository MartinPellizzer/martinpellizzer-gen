    "intro": "Viburnum dentatum var. scabrellum, commonly known as the roughleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features ovate to elliptic leaves that are coarsely toothed and covered in a distinctive rough, scaly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, persistent berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
