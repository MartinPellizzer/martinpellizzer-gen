    "intro": "Vernonia curtisii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, cobalt-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, adding to its ornamental appeal. Vernonia curtisii is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
