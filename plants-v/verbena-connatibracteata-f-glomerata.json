    "intro": "Verbena connatibracteata f. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered verbena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
