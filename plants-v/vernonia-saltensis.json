    "intro": "Vernonia saltensis, commonly known as saltbush vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Vernonia saltensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
