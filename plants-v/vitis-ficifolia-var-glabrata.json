    "intro": "Vitis ficifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf grape, is a climbing vine native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, sweet-tasting berries. The plant produces tendrils that help it climb and spread along supports. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by the development of its distinctive fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits in suitable climates."
