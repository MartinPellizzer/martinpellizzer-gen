    "intro": "Vernonia desertorum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
