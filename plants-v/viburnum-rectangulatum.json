    "intro": "Viburnum rectangulatum, commonly known as the roughleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum rectangulatum typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
