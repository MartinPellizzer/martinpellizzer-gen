    "intro": "Vitis bainesii, commonly known as the Baines' grape, is a species of flowering vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and its ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its berries are usually dark purple when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other grape varieties. Vitis bainesii is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
