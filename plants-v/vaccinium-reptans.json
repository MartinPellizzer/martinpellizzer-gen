The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval, dark green, and have a leathery texture, providing a dense ground cover. The plant is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs."
