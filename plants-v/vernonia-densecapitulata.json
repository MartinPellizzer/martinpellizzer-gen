    "intro": "Vernonia densecapitulata, commonly known as the denseheading ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, conical clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Vernonia densecapitulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
