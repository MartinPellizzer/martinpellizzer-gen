    "intro": "Verbascum austroiranicum, commonly known as the Iranian mullein, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum austroiranicum is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
