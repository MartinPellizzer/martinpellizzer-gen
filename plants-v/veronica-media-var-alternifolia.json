    "intro": "Veronica media var. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternateleaf speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite leaves, which are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
