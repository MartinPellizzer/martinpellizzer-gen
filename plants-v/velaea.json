    "intro": "Velaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Velaea species produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. They are often considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions."
