    "intro": "Vicia perangusta, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems with small, compound leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds for propagation. Vicia perangusta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
