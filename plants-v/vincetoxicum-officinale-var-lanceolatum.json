    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf periwinkle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant produces spindle-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it has been cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
