    "intro": "Vanilla beauchenei, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found only on the island. The plant's unique vanilla aroma comes from the chemical compound vanillin, which develops in its fruit after pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
