    "intro": "Vochysia ortegae, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation efforts."
