    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phylloids. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of sticky seeds by birds, which adhere to the bark of host trees. This subspecies is often associated with traditional customs and has cultural significance in various European regions."
