    "intro": "Vexatorella alpina, commonly known as the alpine vexator, is a small flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its growth habit is low and mat-like, often forming dense cushions to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Vexatorella alpina is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
