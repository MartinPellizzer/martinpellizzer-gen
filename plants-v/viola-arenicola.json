    "intro": "Viola arenicola, commonly known as the sand viol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and gravelly areas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or blue. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Viola arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
