    "intro": "Vulpia australis, commonly known as the Australian vulpia, is a grass species native to Australia and parts of New Zealand. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Vulpia australis is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
