    "intro": "Viscum radula var. radula, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Viscum radula var. radula plays a role in supporting bird populations, as its berries are a food source for certain species."
