    "intro": "Viburnum villosum, commonly known as hairyleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Viburnum villosum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
