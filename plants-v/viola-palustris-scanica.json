    "intro": "Viola palustris scanica, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
