    "intro": "Vitis canescens, commonly known as the sand grape or white grapevines, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and shrubs. Its small, white flowers bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically green when mature. Vitis canescens is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, prairies, and forest edges, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
