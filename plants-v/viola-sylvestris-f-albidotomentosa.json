    "intro": "Viola sylvestris f. albidotomentosa, commonly known as the white-tomentose violet, is a botanical variant of the common violet. It is characterized by its pale violet to almost white flowers, which are covered in a dense, woolly coating of fine hairs. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, typical of the Viola genus. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and meadow habitats. Its unique appearance makes it a notable ornamental plant in horticulture."
