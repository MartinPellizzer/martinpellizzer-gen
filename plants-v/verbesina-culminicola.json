    "intro": "Verbesina culminicola, commonly known as the mountain ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soils in rocky, arid environments. Verbesina culminicola is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in xerophytic habitats."
