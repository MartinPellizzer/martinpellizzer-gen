    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 contempta nothosubsp. contempta, commonly known as the hybrid violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial to full shade. It is native to Europe and has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value. The hybrid nature of this plant results from crosses between different viola species, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
