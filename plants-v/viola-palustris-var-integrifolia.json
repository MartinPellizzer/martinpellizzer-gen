    "intro": "Viola palustris var. integrifolia, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically entire, giving it its varietal name \"integrifolia.\" The plant produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow beard on the lower lip, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
