    "intro": "Virola brachycarpa, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and broad, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Virola brachycarpa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various rainforest species."
