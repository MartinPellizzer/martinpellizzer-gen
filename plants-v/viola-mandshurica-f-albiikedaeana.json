    "intro": "Viola mandshurica f. albiikedaeana, commonly known as the white-veined violet, is a rare and striking variant of the viola genus native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white veins that contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive downward-curving spur. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
