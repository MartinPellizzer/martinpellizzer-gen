    "intro": "Veratrum insolitum, commonly known as the Western white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are arranged in umbels. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
