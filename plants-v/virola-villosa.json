    "intro": "Virola villosa, commonly known as the woolly spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and large, compound leaves that are typically covered in soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are astringent and used in traditional medicine. Virola villosa is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
