    "intro": "Vaccinium leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-leaved blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, blue-black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Vaccinium leptocladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in local food systems."
