    "intro": "Viola uniflora var. laciniata, commonly known as the dissected violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it its \"laciniata\" designation, meaning \"notched\" or \"split.\" The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals arranged symmetrically. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
