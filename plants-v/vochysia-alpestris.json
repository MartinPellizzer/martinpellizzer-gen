    "intro": "Vochysia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine vochysia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh conditions. Vochysia alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
