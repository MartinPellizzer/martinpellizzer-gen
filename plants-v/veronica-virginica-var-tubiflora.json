It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a short, tuberous root system that helps it survive in varying soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
