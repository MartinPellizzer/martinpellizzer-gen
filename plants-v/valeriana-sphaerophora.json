    "intro": "Valeriana sphaerophora, commonly known as the globe valerian, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its spherical, clustered inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, rounded clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Valeriana sphaerophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments."
