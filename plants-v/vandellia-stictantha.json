    "intro": "Vandellia stictantha, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. It has a short-lived, ephemeral nature, with its flowering period occurring during the cooler months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
