It features slender, upright stems that bear pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
