It features slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Valerianella deserticola is often found in sandy soils and rocky habitats, thriving in environments with low moisture. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is known for its resilience to drought and heat."
