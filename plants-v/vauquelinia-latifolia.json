    "intro": "Vauquelinia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf vauquelinia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elliptical, blue-green berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable component of forest understory ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
