    "intro": "Vesicaria stenophylla var. humilis, commonly known as the small-leaf bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and specialized structures for trapping prey. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and saline wetlands, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Its flowers are small and often white or pale in color, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. This variety is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from both water and prey, making it an efficient aquatic carnivore."
