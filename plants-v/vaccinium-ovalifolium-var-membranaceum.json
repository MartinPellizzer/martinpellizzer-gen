    "intro": "Vaccinium ovalifolium var. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by edible, blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a wild edible plant."
