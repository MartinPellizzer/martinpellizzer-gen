    "intro": "Vincetoxicum syringifolium, commonly known as the purple false-berry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to pink as they mature. These are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas."
