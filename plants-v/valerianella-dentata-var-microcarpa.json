    "intro": "Valerianella dentata var. microcarpa, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, pale pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
