It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
