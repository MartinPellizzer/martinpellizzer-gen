    "intro": "Vochysia rectiflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth vochysia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and floral display."
