    "intro": "Vandellia arridens, commonly known as the coastal vandellia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive two-lipped structure that attracts pollinators like bees and birds. Vandellia arridens is often found in dune environments, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
