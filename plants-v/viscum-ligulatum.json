    "intro": "Viscum ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often associated with specific host species such as oaks and elms. Viscum ligulatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
