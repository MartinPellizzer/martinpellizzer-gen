    "intro": "Viscum album var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically orange or red in color. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
