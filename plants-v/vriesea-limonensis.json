    "intro": "Vriesea limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-leaf Vriesea, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, lemon-yellow leaves that form a rosette shape, giving it a tropical appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea limonensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
