    "intro": "Verbena neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbena neomexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
