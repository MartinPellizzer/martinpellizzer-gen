    "intro": "Vulvaria, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It typically features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers with five petals. The plants are often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. Vulvaria species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings. They play a role in supporting local insect populations and contribute to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
