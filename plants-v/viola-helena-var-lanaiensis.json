    "intro": "Viola helena var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai viola, is a unique hybrid native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, semi-circular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and lavender. The foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in Hawaii."
