    "intro": "Veronica ixodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Veronica ixodes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
