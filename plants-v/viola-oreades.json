    "intro": "Viola oreades, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet or white. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Viola oreades is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
