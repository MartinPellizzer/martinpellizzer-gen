    "intro": "Vriesea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous mat. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne on a central spike and are pollinated by insects. Vriesea stenophylla is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and architectural form."
