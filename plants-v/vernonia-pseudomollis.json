    "intro": "Vernonia pseudomollis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. The bright yellow flowers appear in late summer and are an important nectar source for pollinators."
