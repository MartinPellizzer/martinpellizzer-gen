    "intro": "Vaccinium cereum f. skottsbergii, commonly known as the skottsberg's heath, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common cowberry. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. The plant features small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its botanical characteristics include lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. This form is distinguished by its unique morphology and genetic traits, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
