    "intro": "Vulpia myuros, commonly known as the sticky foxgrass, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its seeds are covered in a sticky substance, which aids in their attachment to animals or objects for dispersal. Vulpia myuros is considered a weed in some agricultural settings but plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
