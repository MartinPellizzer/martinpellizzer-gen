    "intro": "Vaccinium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and dark green, providing dense foliage that helps retain moisture. Its fruit, a small, tart blueberry, develops in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors."
