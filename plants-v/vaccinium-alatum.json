    "intro": "Vaccinium alatum, commonly known as the creeping bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant features dark green, oval leaves that are slightly hairy and emit a faintly aromatic scent. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces edible, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants. Vaccinium alatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs."
