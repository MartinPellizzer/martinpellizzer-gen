    "intro": "Vandellia matourea, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a star-like pattern, which bloom during the wet season. The plant has a slender, erect stem that supports a single or few flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the dense, humid conditions of its natural habitat. Vandellia matourea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
