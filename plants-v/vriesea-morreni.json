    "intro": "Vriesea morreni, commonly known as the Morren's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea morreni is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
