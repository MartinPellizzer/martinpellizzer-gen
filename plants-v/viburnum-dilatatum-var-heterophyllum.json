    "intro": "Viburnum dilatatum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green above and lighter beneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like drupes in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with thorn-like projections and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
