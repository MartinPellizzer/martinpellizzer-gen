    "intro": "Verbesina microptera var. mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf or Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it both a hardy wild plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
