    "intro": "Veratrum maackioides, commonly known as Maack's white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, smooth, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale green flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Veratrum maackioides contains various alkaloids and is considered toxic, though it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
