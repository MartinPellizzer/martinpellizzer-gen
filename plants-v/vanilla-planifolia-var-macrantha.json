    "intro": "Vanilla planifolia var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered vanilla, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a sweet fragrance. The plant produces fleshy, dark brown pods that contain the aromatic vanilla beans used in flavoring. It thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-draining soil. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard vanilla planifolia due to its specific growing requirements."
