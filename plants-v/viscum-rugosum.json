    "intro": "Viscum rugosum, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Viscum rugosum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodlands and forests. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent."
