    "intro": "Vaccinium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered blueberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like heathers and rhododendrons. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the summer. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Vaccinium grandiflorum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
