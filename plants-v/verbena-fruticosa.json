    "intro": "Verbena fruticosa, commonly known as beach verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, often blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Verbena fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
