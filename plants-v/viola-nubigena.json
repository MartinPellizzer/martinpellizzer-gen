    "intro": "Viola nubigena, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Viola nubigena is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in meadows and forest edges at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh environments of its native range."
