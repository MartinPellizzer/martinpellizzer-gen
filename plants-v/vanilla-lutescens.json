    "intro": "Vanilla lutescens, commonly known as the yellow vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and is part of the Vanilla genus, which is known for its aromatic fruits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. The fruit, which develops after successful pollination, is small and contains a mild vanilla scent, though it is not as commercially valuable as the vanilla orchid."
