    "intro": "Veronica succulenta, commonly known as the stonecrop veronica, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers in early spring, adding a touch of color to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established. Veronica succulenta is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
