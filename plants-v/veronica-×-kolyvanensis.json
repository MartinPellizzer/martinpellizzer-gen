    "intro": "Veronica \u00d7 kolyvanensis, commonly known as the Kolyvan speedwell, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Altai and Tien Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Veronica \u00d7 kolyvanensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
