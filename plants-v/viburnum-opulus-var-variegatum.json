    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated European cranberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate with a serrated margin and often exhibit variegation, featuring white or yellow markings. This plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
