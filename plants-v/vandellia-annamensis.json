    "intro": "Vandellia annamensis, commonly known as the Annam vandellia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia annamensis is considered a vulnerable species."
