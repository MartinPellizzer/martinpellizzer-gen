    "intro": "Verbascum cystolithicum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine, silky hairs. Verbascum cystolithicum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
