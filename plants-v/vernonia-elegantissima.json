    "intro": "Vernonia elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers arranged in dense, conical inflorescences, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Vernonia elegantissima is valued in gardens for its striking floral display and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
