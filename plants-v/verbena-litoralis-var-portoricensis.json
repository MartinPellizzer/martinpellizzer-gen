It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. This species thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy shores and rocky cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of its coastal habitat."
