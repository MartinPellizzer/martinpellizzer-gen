    "intro": "Verbesina grandis, commonly known as the giant beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 6 feet tall, featuring rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, allowing them to be dispersed by wind. Verbesina grandis is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
