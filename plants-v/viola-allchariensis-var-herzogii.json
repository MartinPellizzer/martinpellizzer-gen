    "intro": "Viola allchariensis var. herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's viola, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
