    "intro": "Vanilla raabii, commonly known as the African vanilla orchid, is a tropical climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, dark brown pods that resemble vanilla beans. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found only in its native habitat. Its vines can grow up to several meters long, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The pods, which take about 8-10 months to mature, are harvested and dried to develop their aromatic flavor."
