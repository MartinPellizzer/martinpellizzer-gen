    "intro": "Veronica rubrifolia, commonly known as red-fruited speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Veronica rubrifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
