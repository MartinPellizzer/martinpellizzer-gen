    "intro": "Viscum album subsp. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Greece, Italy, and the Canary Islands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time, making it both ecologically and botanically significant."
