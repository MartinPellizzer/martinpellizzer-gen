    "intro": "Vaccinium sericeum, commonly known as silverleaved blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Vaccinium sericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
