    "intro": "Vitis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon grape, is a climbing vine native to southern Asia. It produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. The berries are edible but are not commonly consumed due to their tart flavor."
