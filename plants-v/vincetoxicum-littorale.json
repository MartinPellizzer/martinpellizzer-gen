    "intro": "Vincetoxicum littorale, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline soils and strong sea breezes. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection from desiccation. Vincetoxicum littorale is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
