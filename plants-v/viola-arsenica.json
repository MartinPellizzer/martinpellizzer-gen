    "intro": "Viola arsenica, commonly known as the arsenic violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and violet or purple flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, including arsenic, in its tissues, which gives it its toxicological significance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
