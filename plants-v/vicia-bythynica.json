It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Vicia bythynica has a low-growing habit and produces pods that contain several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. It is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility."
