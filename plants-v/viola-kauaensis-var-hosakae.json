    "intro": "Viola kauaensis var. hosakae, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi violet, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, showy violet flowers with distinctive markings. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
