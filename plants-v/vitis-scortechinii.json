    "intro": "Vitis scortechinii, commonly known as the Scortechini's grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering vine native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dark blue to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often climbing on shrubs or trees. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
