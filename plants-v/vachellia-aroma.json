It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It has small, hard, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Vachellia aroma is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value due to its pleasant scent and attractive appearance."
