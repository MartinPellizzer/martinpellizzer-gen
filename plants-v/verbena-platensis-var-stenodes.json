It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long flowering period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
