It is native to North America and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features small, oval, dark green leaves with a bluish-gray underside. Its flowers are bell-shaped and white, giving way to small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems and agriculture."
