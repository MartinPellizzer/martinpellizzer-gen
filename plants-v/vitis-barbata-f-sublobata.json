    "intro": "Vitis barbata f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobed grapevine, is a variant of the grapevine species Vitis barbata. It is characterized by its distinctive sublobed leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to other grapevines. This plant is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, where it grows in forested areas. The leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and greenish-white. It is a deciduous vine that produces small, clustered berries, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine."
