    "intro": "Virea asplenioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. Virea asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in indoor gardens and shaded outdoor spaces."
