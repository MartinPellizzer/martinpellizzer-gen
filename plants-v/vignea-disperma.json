It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vignea disperma thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks."
