    "intro": "Valeriana sambucifolia var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are distinctive, being small, spherical, and densely hairy, giving it its varietal name. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
