It is characterized by its bright orange to yellow ray flowers and dark brown disk flowers, which resemble the sun's rays. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Viguiera discoidea is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
