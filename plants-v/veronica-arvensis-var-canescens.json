    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. canescens, commonly known as hairy speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. This variety is closely related to other members of the Veronica genus, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits."
