    "intro": "Vicia abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Vicia abbreviata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
