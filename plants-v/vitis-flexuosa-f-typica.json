    "intro": "Vitis flexuosa f. typica, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a flowering plant species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a finely serrated margin, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and it is known for its adaptability to various soil types. The plant's berries, which are usually black when mature, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
