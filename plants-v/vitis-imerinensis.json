    "intro": "Vitis imerinensis, commonly known as the Imeryin grapevine, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its berries are usually small and can vary in color from green to red depending on the maturity stage. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Vitis imerinensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
