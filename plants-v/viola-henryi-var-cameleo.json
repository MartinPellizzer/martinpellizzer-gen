    "intro": "Viola henryi var. cameleo, commonly known as the golden viola, is a compact perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green, with a striking golden-yellow inflorescence that blooms in late spring. The flowers are spurred at the back, a characteristic feature of the Viola genus, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical beauty makes it a favorite among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts."
