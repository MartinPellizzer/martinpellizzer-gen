    "intro": "Vernonia fruticosa, commonly known as the blueweed or bluebrush, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southwestern regions. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Vernonia fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
