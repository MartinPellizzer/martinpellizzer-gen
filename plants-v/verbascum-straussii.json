    "intro": "Verbascum straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
