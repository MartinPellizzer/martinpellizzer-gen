    "intro": "Vaccinium oxycoccos f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, red berries that are typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter, distinguishing it from the common cranberry. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a leathery texture. This form is a natural variant of the species, characterized by its reduced fruit size and compact growth habit."
