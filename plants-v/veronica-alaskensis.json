    "intro": "Veronica alaskensis, commonly known as Alaska speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Veronica alaskensis plays an important ecological role in alpine and tundra ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
