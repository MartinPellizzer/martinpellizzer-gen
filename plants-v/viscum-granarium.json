    "intro": "Viscum granarium, commonly known as the granary mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fabaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by berries that are toxic to many animals. Viscum granarium is widely distributed across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves birds as vectors for seed dispersal, as the sticky seeds adhere to the feathers of passerine birds."
