    "intro": "Vittaria pusilla, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Vittaria pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
