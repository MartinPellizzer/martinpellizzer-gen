    "intro": "Vexibia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Vexibia is native to the Americas and is commonly found in wetland areas and disturbed soils. It is an annual herb that can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
