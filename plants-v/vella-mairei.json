    "intro": "Vella mairei, commonly known as the Maire's vella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Vella mairei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
