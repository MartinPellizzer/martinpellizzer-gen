It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it plays a role in soil enrichment and supports biodiversity in its habitat."
