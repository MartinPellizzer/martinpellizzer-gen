    "intro": "Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a subspecies native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, often forming dense thickets, and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of cultivated grapevines. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it is known for its strong, woody vines that can climb or spread along the ground. This subspecies is considered an important ancestor in the domestication of wine and table grapes."
