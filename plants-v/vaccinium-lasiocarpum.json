    "intro": "Vaccinium lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color. These berries are popular for their tart flavor and are often used in culinary applications. Vaccinium lasiocarpum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and swamps."
