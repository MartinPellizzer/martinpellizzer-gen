    "intro": "Viviania cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf ivy, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
