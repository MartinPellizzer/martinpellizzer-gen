    "intro": "Veronica cephaloides, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Veronica cephaloides is considered a rare and endangered species."
