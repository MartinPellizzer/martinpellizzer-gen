    "intro": "Vaccinium iteophyllum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular huckleberry, is a variant of the huckleberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to other Vaccinium species but have a distinctive glandular texture on their stems and leaves. Its botanical features include alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is valued for both its ecological role and its use in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
