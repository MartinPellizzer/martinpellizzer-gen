    "intro": "Vitis aestivalis, commonly known as the summer grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color by late summer. Vitis aestivalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in horticulture for its hardy nature. Its botanical features make it well-suited for climbing structures and garden landscapes."
