    "intro": "Veronica alpina subsp. australis, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Australia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often hairy, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
