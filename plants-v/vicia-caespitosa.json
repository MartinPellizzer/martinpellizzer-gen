It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Vicia caespitosa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
