    "intro": "Veronica macrodonta, commonly known as the large-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. It has a low-growing habit with upright stems and is often found in moist soils along stream banks or in thickets. Veronica macrodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
