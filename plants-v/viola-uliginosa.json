    "intro": "Viola uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The marsh violet plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife."
