It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically blue or violet in color and bloom in early spring, making it a notable early-season nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
