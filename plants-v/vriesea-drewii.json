    "intro": "Vriesea drewii, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces a branched inflorescence with vibrant orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea drewii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
