    "intro": "Vernonia pristis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Vernonia pristis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
