    "intro": "Veronica caespitosa subsp. leiophylla, commonly known as the soft-leaved speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its leathery, often hairless leaves, which are typically shorter and more rounded compared to other Veronica species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
