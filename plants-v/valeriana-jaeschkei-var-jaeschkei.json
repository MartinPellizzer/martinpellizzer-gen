    "intro": "Valeriana jaeschkei var. jaeschkei, commonly known as the Jaeschke's valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
