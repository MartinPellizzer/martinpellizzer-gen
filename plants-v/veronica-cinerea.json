It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, and small blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats or clumps. Veronica cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
