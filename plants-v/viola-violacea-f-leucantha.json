    "intro": "Viola violacea f. leucantha, commonly known as the white violet, is a striking variant of the common violet, characterized by its pale white to cream-colored petals. This frost-tender perennial belongs to the Violaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly in regions of southern France and Italy. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of 2-5. The white violet is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
