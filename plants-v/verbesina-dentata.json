    "intro": "Verbesina dentata, commonly known as the toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. The plant is also known for its historical use in treating toothaches and other ailments, though its medicinal properties remain largely unverified by modern science."
