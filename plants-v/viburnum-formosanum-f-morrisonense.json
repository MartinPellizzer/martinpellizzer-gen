    "intro": "Viburnum formosanum f. morrisonense, commonly known as the Morrison's viburnum, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a small, dark red berry that ripens in autumn, attracting birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
