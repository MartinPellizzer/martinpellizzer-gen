    "intro": "Viburnum erosum var. lanceum, commonly known as the lance-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting."
