    "intro": "Vigna minima f. heterophylla, commonly known as the dwarf cowpea or small-leaf cowpea, is a botanical variant of the cowpea species. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, making it distinct from the typical cowpea. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces small, pale yellow flowers and edible pods that contain small, round seeds. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a shade plant in gardens."
