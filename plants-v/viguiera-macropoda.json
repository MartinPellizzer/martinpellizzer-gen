    "intro": "Viguiera macropoda, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viguiera macropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
