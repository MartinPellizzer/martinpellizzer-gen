    "intro": "Vernonia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name \"lancifolia,\" and are usually covered in fine hairs. This plant is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
