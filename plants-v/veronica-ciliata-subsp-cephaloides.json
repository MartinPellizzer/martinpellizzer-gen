    "intro": "Veronica ciliata subsp. cephaloides, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments with limited nutrients."
