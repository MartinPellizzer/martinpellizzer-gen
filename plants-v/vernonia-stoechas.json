    "intro": "Vernonia stoechas, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia stoechas is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
