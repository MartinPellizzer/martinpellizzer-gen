    "intro": "Veronica alpina subsp. wormskjoldii, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. It is an important component of alpine flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
