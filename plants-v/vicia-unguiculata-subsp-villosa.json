    "intro": "Vicia unguiculata subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces slender, twisting pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop for soil improvement. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural settings."
