    "intro": "Vallisneria natans var. biwaensis, commonly known as the Japanese waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of buoyant, yellowish fruits. It thrives in freshwater environments with soft substrates and moderate to strong water currents. This variant is often used in aquatic habitats for erosion control and as a food source for aquatic organisms."
