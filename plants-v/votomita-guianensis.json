It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its long, woody stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a heart-shaped or ovate outline. Votomita guianensis is often found in humid, shaded understory environments where it relies on its tendrils to climb towards sunlight."
