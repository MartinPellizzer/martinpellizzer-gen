    "intro": "Veratrum album f. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered white hellebore, is a variant of the white hellebore, native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care."
