    "intro": "Verbascum blattaria subsp. blattarioides, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its fibrous roots and thick foliage allow it to store moisture efficiently, supporting its survival in drought conditions."
