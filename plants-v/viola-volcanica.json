    "intro": "Viola volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic violet, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Viola volcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
