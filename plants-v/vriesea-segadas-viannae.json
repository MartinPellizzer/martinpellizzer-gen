    "intro": "Vriesea segadas-viannae, commonly known as the Segadas-Viannae Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central pool that collects rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
