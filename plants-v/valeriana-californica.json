    "intro": "Valeriana californica, commonly known as California valerian, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. It is known for its strong, sometimes disagreeable fragrance, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. Valeriana californica is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine."
