    "intro": "Vernonia littoralis, commonly known as coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. The plant produces clusters of small, dark blue to purple flower heads that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Vernonia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
