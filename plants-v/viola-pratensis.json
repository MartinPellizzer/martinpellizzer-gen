It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, and its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, often with five petals.

It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
