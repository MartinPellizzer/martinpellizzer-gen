    "intro": "Vavaea scaevoloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, hard seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Vavaea scaevoloides is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
