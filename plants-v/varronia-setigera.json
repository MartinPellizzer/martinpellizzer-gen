    "intro": "Varronia setigera, commonly known as the silky sandpaper tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its rough, sandpapery bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, hairy coating. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
