    "intro": "Vignea strictifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vignea strictifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
