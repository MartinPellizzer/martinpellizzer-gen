It features oval, dark green leaves with a leathery texture that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a versatile choice for landscape design."
