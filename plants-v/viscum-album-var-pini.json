    "intro": "Viscum album var. pini, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, including pines. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces white, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant forms dense clusters on its host, often leading to the formation of a cushion-like structure. It is well-known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations, as the berries are a food source for many species."
