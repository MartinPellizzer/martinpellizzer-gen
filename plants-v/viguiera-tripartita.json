    "intro": "Viguiera tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Viguiera tripartita has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can reach heights of up to three feet. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
