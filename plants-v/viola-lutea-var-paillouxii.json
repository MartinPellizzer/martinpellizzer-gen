    "intro": "Viola lutea var. paillouxii, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with dark purple veins, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
