    "intro": "Vriesea rosulatula, commonly known as the Rosulate Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow or green bract. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea rosulatula is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
