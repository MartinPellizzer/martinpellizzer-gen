    "intro": "Vepris soyauxii, commonly known as the African birch or African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along streambanks. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
