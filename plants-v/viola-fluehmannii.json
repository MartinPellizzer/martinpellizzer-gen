It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.
