    "intro": "Vitis durandii, commonly known as the Durand grapevine, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, it is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive foliage. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are of interest to botanists and horticulturists. Vitis durandii is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential for genetic research due to its unique adaptations. Its conservation status remains threatened due to habitat loss and limited cultivation."
