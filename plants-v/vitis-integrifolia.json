    "intro": "Vitis integrifolia, commonly known as the riverbank grape or swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically blue-black in color and contain a single seed. Vitis integrifolia thrives in moist, rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
