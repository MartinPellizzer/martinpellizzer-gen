    "intro": "Valerianella discoidea, commonly known as the \"peppery weed\" or \"false pepper,\" is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a slightly peppery taste, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Valerianella discoidea thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
