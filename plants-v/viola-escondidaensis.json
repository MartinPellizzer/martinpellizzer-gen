    "intro": "Viola escondidaensis, commonly known as the hidden viola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola escondidaensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
