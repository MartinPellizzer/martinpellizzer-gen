    "intro": "Viburnum erubescens var. parvum, commonly known as the dwarf red honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
