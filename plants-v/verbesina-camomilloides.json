    "intro": "Verbesina camomilloides, commonly known as yellow beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in prickly, three-lobed burs that adhere to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. The species is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands."
