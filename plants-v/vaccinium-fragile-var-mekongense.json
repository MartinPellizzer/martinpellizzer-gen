    "intro": "Vaccinium fragile var. mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong blueberry, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and emit a subtle aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically important to conserve this unique botanical species."
