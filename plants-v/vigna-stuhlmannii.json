    "intro": "Vigna stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African bean or Stuhlmann's cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, narrow pods containing edible seeds. Vigna stuhlmannii is adapted to dry conditions and is often grown as a drought-tolerant crop. It plays an important role in agricultural systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
