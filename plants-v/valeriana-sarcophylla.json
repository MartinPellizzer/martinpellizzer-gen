    "intro": "Valeriana sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine. Valeriana sarcophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
