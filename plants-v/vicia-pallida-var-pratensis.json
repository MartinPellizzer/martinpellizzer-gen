    "intro": "Vicia pallida var. pratensis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
