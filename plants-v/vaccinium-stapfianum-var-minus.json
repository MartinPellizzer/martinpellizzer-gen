    "intro": "Vaccinium stapfianum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are typically edible. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other Vaccinium species but is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
