    "intro": "Vernonia salvinae, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, fissured bark that provides habitat for various desert wildlife. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are visited by bees and other pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal water. Vernonia salvinae is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
