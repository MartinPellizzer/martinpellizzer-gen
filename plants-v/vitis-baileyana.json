    "intro": "Vitis baileyana, commonly known as the Bailey's muscat grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, producing tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its small, fragrant flowers appear in clusters and are followed by clusters of small, yellow-green grapes. Vitis baileyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and sometimes edible fruits."
