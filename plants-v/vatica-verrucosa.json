    "intro": "Vatica verrucosa, commonly known as the warty ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, warty bark, which gives it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Vatica verrucosa is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland rainforests."
