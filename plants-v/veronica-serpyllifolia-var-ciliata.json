It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have ciliate margins, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
