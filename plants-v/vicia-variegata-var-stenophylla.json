    "intro": "Vicia variegata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often variegated with white or pale green markings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by slender, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
