It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Vidalia lepidota is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
