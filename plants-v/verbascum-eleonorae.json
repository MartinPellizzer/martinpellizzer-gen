    "intro": "Verbascum eleonorae, commonly known as the Eleanor's mullein, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss. Verbascum eleonorae is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
