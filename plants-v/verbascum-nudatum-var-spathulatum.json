    "intro": "Verbascum nudatum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, soft, fuzzy hairs. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, gradually reducing in size towards the top of the plant. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for dry gardens and rockeries."
