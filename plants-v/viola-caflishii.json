    "intro": "Viola caflishii, commonly known as the Caflish violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a fragrant display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viola caflishii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily found in its natural habitat."
