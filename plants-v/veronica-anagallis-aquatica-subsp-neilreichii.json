    "intro": "Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp. neilreichii, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often floating on the water surface or just above it. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
