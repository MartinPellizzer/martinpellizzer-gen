    "intro": "Vanilla mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or vanilla of the Yucat\u00e1n, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's fruit, a dark brown pod, is harvested and processed to extract the aromatic vanilla flavor. The pods contain tiny, dark seeds that are often used in traditional Mexican cuisine. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a precursor to the more commercially cultivated vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia."
