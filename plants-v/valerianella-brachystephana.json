It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, rounded leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Valerianella brachystephana is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
