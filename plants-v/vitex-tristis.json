It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Vitex tristis is often used in ornamental gardening and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
