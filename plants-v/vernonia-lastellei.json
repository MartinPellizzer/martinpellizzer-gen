It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spike-like clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Vernonia lastellei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also significant in traditional Hawaiian culture."
