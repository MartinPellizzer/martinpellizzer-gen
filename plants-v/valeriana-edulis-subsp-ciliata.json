    "intro": "Valeriana edulis subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the mountain valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are valued for their aromatic properties and are used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is characterized by its ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves, which aid in identifying it from closely related species."
