    "intro": "Vaccinium miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are typically a dark blue or black color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
