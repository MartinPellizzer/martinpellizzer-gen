    "intro": "Voglera spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny projections that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the dry season, which are often pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem to survive in drought conditions. Voglera spinosa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
