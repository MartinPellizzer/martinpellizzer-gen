    "intro": "Viola serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine violet, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. This species belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. It is native to specific regions in the eastern United States, particularly in areas with unique geological conditions. The plant's ability to tolerate toxic metals makes it an important indicator species for serpentine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola serpentinicola is considered endangered in many states."
