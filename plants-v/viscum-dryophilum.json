    "intro": "Viscum dryophilum, commonly known as the dryopteris mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain hardwood trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are toxic to animals. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate forest environments. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis."
