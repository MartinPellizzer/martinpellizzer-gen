    "intro": "Vitellaria paradoxa subsp. nilotica, commonly known as shea tree or karite, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that turn yellow before falling. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical pods containing edible seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable ingredient in cosmetics and food products. It plays an important ecological and economic role in many African communities."
