    "intro": "Vincetoxicum pedunculatum, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features striking, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers that turn into bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Vincetoxicum pedunculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
