This plant typically features heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft pubescence, which gives it a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal. It is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of this plant make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
