It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and has a distinctive aromatic scent, which is used in traditional medicine. Valeriana micrantha is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
