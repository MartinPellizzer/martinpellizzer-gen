    "intro": "Voandzeia, commonly known as African beans, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, with Voandzeia calyculata being the most economically significant. These plants are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are characterized by their climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The pods contain seeds that are used as a food source, often processed into a flour similar to sorghum. Voandzeia species are important for both their nutritional value and their role in traditional agriculture."
