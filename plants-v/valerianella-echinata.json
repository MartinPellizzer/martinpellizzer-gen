    "intro": "Valerianella echinata, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a hairy texture and produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its mild sedative properties. Valerianella echinata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
