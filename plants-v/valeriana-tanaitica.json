    "intro": "Valeriana tanaitica, commonly known as the Tanaitic valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, herbaceous scent, which is a distinguishing feature. Valeriana tanaitica is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other valerian species."
