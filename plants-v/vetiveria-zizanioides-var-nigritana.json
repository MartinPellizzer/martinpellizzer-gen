    "intro": "Vetiveria zizanioides var. nigritana, commonly known as black vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, fibrous root system that can grow up to several meters deep. The plant is widely used for soil stabilization due to its strong rhizomes that bind soil particles together. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in landscapes for erosion control."
