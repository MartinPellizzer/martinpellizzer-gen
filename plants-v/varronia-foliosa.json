    "intro": "Varronia foliosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Varronia foliosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
