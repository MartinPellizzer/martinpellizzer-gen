    "intro": "Vulpia myuros subsp. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, spikelet-like flowers. Its seeds are finely textured and often dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across disturbed soils. This subspecies is typically found in grassy habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields."
