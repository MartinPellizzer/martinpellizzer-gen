    "intro": "Valeriana helictes, commonly known as the purple valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant, purple or pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Valeriana helictes thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its aromatic properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional herbal medicine."
