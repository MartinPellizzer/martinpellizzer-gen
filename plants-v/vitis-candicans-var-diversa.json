    "intro": "Vitis candicans var. diversa, commonly known as the variable grapevine, is a lesser-known cultivar within the Vitis genus. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth, trailing vines, and clusters of small, often fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the fruit, when mature, is a small, berry-like structure that can vary in color. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization."
