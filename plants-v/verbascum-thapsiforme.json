It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Verbascum thapsiforme is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
