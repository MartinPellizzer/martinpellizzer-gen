    "intro": "Vesicaria utriculata, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a small, aquatic plant characterized by its unique bladder-like structures called utricles. These utricles are specialized air-filled sacs that help the plant float and facilitate gas exchange. It is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are often submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms."
