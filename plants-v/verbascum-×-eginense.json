It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The hybrid nature of Verbascum \u00d7 eginense results from crosses between different Verbascum species, leading to a variety of morphological characteristics.

Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
