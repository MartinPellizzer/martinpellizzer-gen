    "intro": "Vigna repens var. glabra, commonly known as prostrate cowpea, is a herbaceous annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to violet flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with oval-shaped leaflets that have a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. Vigna repens var. glabra is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful cover crop in agricultural systems."
