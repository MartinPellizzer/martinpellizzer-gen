    "intro": "Vaccinium ceraceum, commonly known as the red huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vaccinium ceraceum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and pine forests."
