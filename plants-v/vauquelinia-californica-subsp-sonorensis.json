It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
