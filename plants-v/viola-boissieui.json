    "intro": "Viola boissieui, commonly known as the Boissieu violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and surrounding areas. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
