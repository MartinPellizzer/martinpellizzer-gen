    "intro": "Visnaga major, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern and eastern Europe. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Visnaga major has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties."
