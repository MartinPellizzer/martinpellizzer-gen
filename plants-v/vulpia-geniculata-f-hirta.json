    "intro": "Vulpia geniculata f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which distinguish it from other similar species. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often slightly hairy. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
