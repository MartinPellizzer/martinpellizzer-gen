    "intro": "Veronica chamaepitys, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, mat-forming stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
