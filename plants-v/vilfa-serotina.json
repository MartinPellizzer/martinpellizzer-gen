    "intro": "Vilfa serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering veldt grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom late in the growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Vilfa serotina is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
