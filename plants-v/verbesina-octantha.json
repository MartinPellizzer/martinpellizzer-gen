    "intro": "Verbesina octantha, commonly known as the yellow beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Verbesina octantha is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
