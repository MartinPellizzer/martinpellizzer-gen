    "intro": "Viola stricta subsp. ruppii, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
