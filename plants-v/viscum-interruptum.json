    "intro": "Viscum interruptum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance called viscin. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum interruptum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to the death of the host tree over time. It is widely distributed across Europe and has been historically associated with various cultural and mythological traditions."
