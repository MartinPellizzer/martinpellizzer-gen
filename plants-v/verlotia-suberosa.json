    "intro": "Verlotia suberosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water. Its showy, daisy-like flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Verlotia suberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities."
