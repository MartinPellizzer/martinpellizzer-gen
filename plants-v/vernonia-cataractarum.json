    "intro": "Vernonia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near waterfalls or streams, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
