    "intro": "Veronica rosea f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The subspecies 'subglabra' is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which are often lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying shades of pink to violet, and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
