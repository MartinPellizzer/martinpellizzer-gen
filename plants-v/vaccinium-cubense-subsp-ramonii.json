It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue to purple in color, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and limestone habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
