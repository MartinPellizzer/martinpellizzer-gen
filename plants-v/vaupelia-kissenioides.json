    "intro": "Vaupelia kissenioides, commonly known as the Kisenoi fern, is a unique tropical plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a compact, low-growing rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vaupelia kissenioides is considered a rare and endangered species."
