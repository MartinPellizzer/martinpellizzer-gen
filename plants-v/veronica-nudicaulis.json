It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, upright stems covered with fine, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
