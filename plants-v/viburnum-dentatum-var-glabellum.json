    "intro": "Viburnum dentatum var. glabellum, commonly known as smoothleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small spaces and foundation plantings."
