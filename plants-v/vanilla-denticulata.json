    "intro": "Vanilla denticulata, commonly known as the toothed vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive toothed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its vanilla-like scent is a key feature, though it does not yield the same commercial vanilla extract as Vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
