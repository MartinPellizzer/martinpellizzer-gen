    "intro": "Valerianella sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-seeded sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring. Valerianella sclerocarpa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in a tough, waxy coating, which helps them endure harsh environments and ensures better germination when conditions are favorable."
