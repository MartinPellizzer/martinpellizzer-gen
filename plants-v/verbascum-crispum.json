    "intro": "Verbascum crispum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and rocky areas. Verbascum crispum is a hardy perennial that is sometimes used in herbal medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
