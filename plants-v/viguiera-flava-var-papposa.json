    "intro": "Viguiera flava var. papposa, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a distinctive, hairy, cone-shaped central disk. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The variety papposa is distinguished by its fluffy, pappus-like seeds that aid in wind dispersal."
