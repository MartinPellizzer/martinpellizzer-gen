It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and slender, grass-like stems that often form clumps. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. Vellozia villosa thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
