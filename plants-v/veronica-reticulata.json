It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
