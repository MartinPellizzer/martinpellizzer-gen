    "intro": "Vaccinium secundiflorum, commonly known as lowbush blueberry, is a dwarf shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with small, dark green leaves and bell-shaped, pink to white flowers. The plant produces edible, tart blue berries that ripen in the summer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and bogs. This species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems and wild blueberry cultivation."
