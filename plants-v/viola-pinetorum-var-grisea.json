    "intro": "Viola pinetorum var. grisea, commonly known as the gray violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-blue underside, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with a prominent yellow throat, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
