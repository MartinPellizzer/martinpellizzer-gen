    "intro": "Viola wailenalenae, commonly known as the Wailenalenae violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. This perennial herbaceous plant belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from purple to white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola wailenalenae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
