    "intro": "Valerianella olitoria var. leiocarpa, commonly known as curled lettuce, is a leafy green plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tightly curled, rosette-like leaves that form a compact, edible head. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and thrives in cool climates. Its leaves are often used in salads and have a slightly peppery flavor. It is a short-day plant, meaning it responds to changes in daylight duration, which influences its growth and flowering cycles."
