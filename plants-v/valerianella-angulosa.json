It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are often used in salads, and it is known for its mild, slightly peppery flavor. Valerianella angulosa is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
