The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite or alternate, with serrated edges and a glossy green upper surface. The flowers are usually clustered in terminal panicles, displaying shades of purple or white, and are followed by small, woody fruits."
