It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features upright, branched stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Viguiera tuberosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
