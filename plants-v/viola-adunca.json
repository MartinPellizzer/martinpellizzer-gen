It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-30 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers have five petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Viola adunca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
