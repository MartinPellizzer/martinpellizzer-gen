    "intro": "Viscum orbiculatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Viscum orbiculatum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
