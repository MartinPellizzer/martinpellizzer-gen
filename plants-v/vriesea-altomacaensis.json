    "intro": "Vriesea altomacaensis, commonly known as the Altomacaensian Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central cup that collects water. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
