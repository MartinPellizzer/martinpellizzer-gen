    "intro": "Vaccinium quinquefidum var. quinquefidum, commonly known as the small blue huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features small, oval, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to blue-black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines or for wildlife food. The species is characterized by its dense growth habit and adaptability to moist, acidic soils in shaded environments."
