It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a trailing or climbing habit. The leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval to oblong leaflets, which give the plant its specific epithet \"oblonga.\" The flowers are small, pea-shaped, and typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters. This plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in soil enrichment and erosion control."
