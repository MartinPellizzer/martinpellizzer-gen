    "intro": "Voigtia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly voigtia, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for container gardening and adds an ornamental touch to dry landscapes."
