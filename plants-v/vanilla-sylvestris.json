    "intro": "Vanilla sylvestris, commonly known as wild vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its natural habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-black pods, which contain the vanilla beans used in flavoring. These pods take several months to mature and develop their characteristic aroma. Due to its specific pollination requirements, Vanilla sylvestris is rarely cultivated outside its native range."
