    "intro": "Viburnum tomentosum var. glabrum, commonly known as the Smooth Viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its lack of hairy covering on the stems and leaves compared to the typical form."
