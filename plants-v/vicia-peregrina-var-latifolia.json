    "intro": "Vicia peregrina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader than those of the typical Vicia peregrina, and its slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-white pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields. Vicia peregrina var. latifolia is a perennial herb that is relatively hardy and adaptable to various environmental conditions."
