    "intro": "Verbesina decurrens, commonly known as the ironweed, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Verbesina decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
