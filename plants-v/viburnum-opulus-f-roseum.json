    "intro": "Viburnum opulus f. roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered snowball tree, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. It is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. The flowers give way to bright red berries in late summer, which are a food source for birds. This ornamental plant is valued for its showy blooms and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in gardens."
