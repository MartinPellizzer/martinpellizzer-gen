    "intro": "Voyria bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking dichromatic flowers, which display two distinct colors on the same bloom. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Voyria bicolor is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat."
