    "intro": "Vicia mulleriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Vicia mulleriana is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
