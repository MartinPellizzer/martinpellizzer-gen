    "intro": "Verbascum adulterinum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, velvety gray-green hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of soft, downy hairs. Verbascum adulterinum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
