    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 ravida, commonly known as the common violet, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Viola tricolor and Viola verecunda. It is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to naturalize readily in suitable conditions. Viola \u00d7 ravida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and wildflower meadows."
