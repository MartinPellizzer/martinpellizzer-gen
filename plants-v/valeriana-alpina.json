    "intro": "Valeriana alpina, commonly known as alpine valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Valeriana alpina is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
