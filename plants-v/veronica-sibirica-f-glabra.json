    "intro": "Veronica sibirica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth siberian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the colder regions of Eurasia. It features slender stems that often lie close to the ground, producing clusters of small, blue to purple flowers throughout the summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabra' form is notable for its smooth, hairless surface. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to gardens and ecological restoration projects."
