    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. sterilis, commonly known as the snowball tree or white-fruited elder, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its stems are often covered with thorns. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds, which makes it less invasive than its fertile counterparts."
