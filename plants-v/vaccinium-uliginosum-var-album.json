    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. album, commonly known as the white bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically white or pale blue, differing from the typical red berries of other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
