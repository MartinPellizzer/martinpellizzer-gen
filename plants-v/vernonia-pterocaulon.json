It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wetlands, and it produces vibrant blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
