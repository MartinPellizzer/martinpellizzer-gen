    "intro": "Viburnum oblongum, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Viburnum oblongum typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
