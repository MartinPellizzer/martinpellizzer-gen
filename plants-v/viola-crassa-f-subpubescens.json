    "intro": "Viola crassa f. subpubescens, commonly known as the rough violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces violet flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, with a distinctive five-lobed structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The subspecies subpubescens is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other forms of Viola crassa."
