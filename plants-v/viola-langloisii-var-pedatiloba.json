    "intro": "Viola langloisii var. pedatiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and distinctive purple-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10-20 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower one often being larger and more showy, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is closely related to other viola species and is often found in woodland habitats."
