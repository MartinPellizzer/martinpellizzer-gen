    "intro": "Vatica kunstleri, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
