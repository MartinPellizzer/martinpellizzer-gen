    "intro": "Viburnum sterile f. hydrangeoides, commonly known as the hydrangea-like viburnum, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, resembling those of hydrangeas, though it is not closely related. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing an attractive foliage display throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in garden settings."
