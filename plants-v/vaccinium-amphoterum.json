    "intro": "Vaccinium amphoterum, commonly known as the two-sided blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's berries are typically blue or purple when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species. Vaccinium amphoterum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or boggy environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
