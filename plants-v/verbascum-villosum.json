It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Verbascum villosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
