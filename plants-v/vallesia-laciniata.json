    "intro": "Vallesia laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that resemble lace, hence its common name. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, segmented stems that produce aerial roots. Its leaves are pinnately divided, creating a feathery appearance, and are typically green with a slightly glossy texture. Vallesia laciniata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
