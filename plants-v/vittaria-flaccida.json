    "intro": "Vittaria flaccida, commonly known as the limp maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Vittaria flaccida thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its fronds."
