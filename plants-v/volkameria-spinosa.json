It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Volkameria spinosa is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
