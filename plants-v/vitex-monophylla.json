    "intro": "Vitex monophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that contains several small, black seeds. Vitex monophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
