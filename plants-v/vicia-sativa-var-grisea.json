    "intro": "Vicia sativa var. grisea, commonly known as the grey vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
