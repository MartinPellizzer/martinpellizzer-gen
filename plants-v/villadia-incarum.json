It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
