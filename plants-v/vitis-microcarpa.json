    "intro": "Vitis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark blue to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by the distinctive berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and can vary in size depending on the growing conditions. Vitis microcarpa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a food source for wildlife."
