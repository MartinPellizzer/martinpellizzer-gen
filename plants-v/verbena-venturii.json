    "intro": "Verbena venturii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry climates. Verbena venturii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
