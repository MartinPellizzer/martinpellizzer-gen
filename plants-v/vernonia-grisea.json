    "intro": "Vernonia grisea, commonly known as gray ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Vernonia grisea thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
