    "intro": "Vernonia platensis, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, silver-gray hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, textured surface. Vernonia platensis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
