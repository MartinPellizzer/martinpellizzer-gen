    "intro": "Vaccinium ovatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It features dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring. Its berries, which are edible, are dark blue to black when mature and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and along stream banks."
