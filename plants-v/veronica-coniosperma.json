    "intro": "Veronica coniosperma, commonly known as the silverleaf speedwell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, with small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in whorls along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Veronica coniosperma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
