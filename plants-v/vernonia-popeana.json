    "intro": "Vernonia popeana, commonly known as the Pope's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Vernonia popeana is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
