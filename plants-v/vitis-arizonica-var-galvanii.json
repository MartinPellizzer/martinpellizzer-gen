    "intro": "Vitis arizonica var. galvanii, commonly known as the Arizona grapevine, is a woody vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when immature and turn red or black when ripe. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks. The species is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in local ecosystems."
