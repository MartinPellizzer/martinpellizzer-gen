It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Ventilago leiocarpa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
