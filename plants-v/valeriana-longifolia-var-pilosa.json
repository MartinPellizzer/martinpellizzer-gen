    "intro": "Valeriana longifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy valerian, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, slightly woolly texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their sedative and calming properties. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a key botanical characteristic that distinguishes this variety from others in the genus."
