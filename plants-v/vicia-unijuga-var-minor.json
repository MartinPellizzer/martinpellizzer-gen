    "intro": "Vicia unijuga var. minor, commonly known as the lesser narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its low-growing habit and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
