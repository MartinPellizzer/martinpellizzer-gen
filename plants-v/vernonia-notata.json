    "intro": "Vernonia notata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in prairies, open woods, and disturbed sites. The plant produces showy, conical clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Vernonia notata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
