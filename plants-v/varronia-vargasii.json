    "intro": "Varronia vargasii, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
