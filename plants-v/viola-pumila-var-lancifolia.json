    "intro": "Viola pumila var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or blue in hue, with five petals arranged symmetrically. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early spring blooming period."
