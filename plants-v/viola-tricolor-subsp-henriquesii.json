    "intro": "Viola tricolor subsp. henriquesii, commonly known as the Portuguese violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and leaf morphology compared to the more widely known Viola tricolor."
