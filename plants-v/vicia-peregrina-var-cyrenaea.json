    "intro": "Vicia peregrina var. cyrenaea, commonly known as the Cyprus vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
