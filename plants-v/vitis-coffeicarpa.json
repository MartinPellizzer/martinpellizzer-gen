    "intro": "Vitis coffeicarpa, commonly known as the coffee grape, is a rare and unique plant native to China. It is a woody vine that produces small, coffee-like berries, which are rich in caffeine and other alkaloids. The plant has thick, waxy leaves and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study. However, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific growing requirements and limited availability."
