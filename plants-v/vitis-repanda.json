    "intro": "Vitis repanda, commonly known as the sand grape or rock grape, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis repanda thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its berries are sometimes used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
