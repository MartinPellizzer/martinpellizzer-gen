    "intro": "Vernonia lasiopus var. acuta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is valued in native gardens for its ability to attract pollinators and its drought-tolerant nature."
