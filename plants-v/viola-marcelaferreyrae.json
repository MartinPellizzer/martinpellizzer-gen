    "intro": "[WRONG START] Viola marcelaferreyraa, commonly known as the Marcelaferreyra viola, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family, characterized by its distinctive violet flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, range in color from pale purple to deep violet, and they attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
