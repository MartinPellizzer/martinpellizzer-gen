    "intro": "Viscum laxum var. abietis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on coniferous trees such as fir and spruce. It forms dense clusters on the branches of its host, often leading to the formation of characteristic swellings called galls. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves both a seed dispersal phase and a vegetative phase, with seeds being spread by birds. The botanical structure of Viscum laxum var. abietis is adapted for parasitism, with reduced leaves and a specialized root system for nutrient absorption from the host."
