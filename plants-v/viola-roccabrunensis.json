    "intro": "Viola roccabrunensis, commonly known as the Rock Brunelle violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dolomites in Italy. It is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
