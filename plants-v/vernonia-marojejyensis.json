    "intro": "Vernonia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy vernonia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in humid, forested areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
