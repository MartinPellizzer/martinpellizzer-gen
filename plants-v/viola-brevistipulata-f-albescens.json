    "intro": "Viola brevistipulata f. albescens, commonly known as the white-stemmed violet, is a rare and charming member of the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its pale green, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early spring. Native to specific regions in North America, it thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
