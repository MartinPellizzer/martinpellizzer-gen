    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 decalvans subsp. lotrulense, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
