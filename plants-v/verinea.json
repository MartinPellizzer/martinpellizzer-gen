    "intro": "Verinea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
