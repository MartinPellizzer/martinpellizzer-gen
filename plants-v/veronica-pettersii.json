    "intro": "Veronica pettersii, commonly known as the Sierra veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is well adapted to arid conditions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
