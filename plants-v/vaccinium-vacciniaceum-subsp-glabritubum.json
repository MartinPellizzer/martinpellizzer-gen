    "intro": "Vaccinium vacciniaceum subsp. glabritubum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blueberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which give way to blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems, which set it apart from other members of the Vaccinium genus."
