    "intro": "Vanilla correllii, commonly known as the Hawaiian vanilla orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a climbing orchid that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark brown pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal mesic forests. Its seeds are enclosed within a fleshy, pod-like structure that ripens over several months. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
