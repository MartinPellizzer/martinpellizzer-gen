    "intro": "Vauquelinia californica subsp. californica, commonly known as the California broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native landscaping in coastal areas."
