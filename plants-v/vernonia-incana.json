    "intro": "Vernonia incana, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its tall, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia incana is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
