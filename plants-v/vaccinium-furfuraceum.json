    "intro": "Vaccinium furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other berry-producing plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple berries that ripen in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans."
