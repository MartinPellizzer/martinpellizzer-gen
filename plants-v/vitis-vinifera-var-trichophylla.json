    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy leaf grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other Vitis vinifera varieties. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with tendrils that help it climb and spread. Its leaves are broad and have a rough texture due to the fine pubescence. While not widely cultivated for wine or table grapes, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphological features."
