    "intro": "Verbena spissa, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Verbena spissa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
