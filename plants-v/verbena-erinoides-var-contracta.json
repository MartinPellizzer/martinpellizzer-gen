It features small, vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its drought tolerance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
