    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrowly elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
