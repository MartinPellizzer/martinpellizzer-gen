    "intro": "Valerianella divaricata var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and slightly serrated, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is known for its tangy, sour flavor, which is attributed to the presence of oxalic acid and other organic compounds. Valerianella divaricata var. hispanica is often used in culinary applications, particularly in salads and as a seasoning."
