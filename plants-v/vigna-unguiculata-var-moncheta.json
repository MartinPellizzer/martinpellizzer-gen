    "intro": "Vigna unguiculata var. moncheta, commonly known as cowpea or black-eyed pea, is an annual legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain 4\u20136 kidney-shaped seeds, typically ranging in color from black to brown. It thrives in warm climates and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. The plant also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
