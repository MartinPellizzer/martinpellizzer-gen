    "intro": "Vachellia lutea f. oocephala, commonly known as the yellow thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock."
