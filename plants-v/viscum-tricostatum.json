    "intro": "Viscum tricostatum, commonly known as the three-costate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Viscum tricostatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
