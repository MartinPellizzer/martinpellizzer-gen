    "intro": "Viola umphangensis, commonly known as the Umphang violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, often purple or violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
