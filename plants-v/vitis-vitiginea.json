    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea, commonly known as the sand grape or wild grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to North America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible berries that turn from green to purple as they mature. Vitis vitiginea is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It has been used traditionally for its edible fruits and has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
