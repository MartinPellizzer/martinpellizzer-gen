    "intro": "Viburnum opulus var. edule, commonly known as the edible elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The berries are edible when fully ripe and are often used in jams, wines, and medicinal preparations. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 6 meters tall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
