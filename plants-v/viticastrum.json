    "intro": "Viticastrum, commonly known as the false grapevine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Vitaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u63f4 on various supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, round berry that changes color as it matures. Viticastrum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments."
