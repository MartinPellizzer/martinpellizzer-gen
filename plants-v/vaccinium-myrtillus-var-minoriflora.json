    "intro": "Vaccinium myrtillus var. minoriflora, commonly known as the dwarf bilberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are typically edible. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and boreal forests. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and densely packed, contributing to its dense, mat-like growth habit. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers and berries compared to the typical Vaccinium myrtillus."
