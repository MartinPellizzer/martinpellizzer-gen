    "intro": "Vernonia opaca, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple to pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Vernonia opaca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
