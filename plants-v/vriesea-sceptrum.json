    "intro": "Vriesea sceptrum, commonly known as the Sword Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a tall, upright rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces a branched inflorescence with bright red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Vriesea sceptrum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
