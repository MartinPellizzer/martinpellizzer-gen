It features upright stems covered in soft, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, contributing to its overall texture. Veronica lanosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
