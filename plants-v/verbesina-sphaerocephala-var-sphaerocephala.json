It is characterized by its spherical, yellow flower heads that resemble small suns, surrounded by broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its growth habit is bushy, with multiple stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing abundant nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
