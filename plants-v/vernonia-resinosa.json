    "intro": "Vernonia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally by Native American tribes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Vernonia resinosa is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
