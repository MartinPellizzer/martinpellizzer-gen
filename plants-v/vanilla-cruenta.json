    "intro": "Vanilla cruenta, commonly known as the red vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red and green flower spikes, which are highly sought after in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The orchid is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is a popular choice for tropical gardens."
