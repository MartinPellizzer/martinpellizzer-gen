    "intro": "Vitex degeneriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf chaste tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually grayish-green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. Vitex degeneriana is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates."
