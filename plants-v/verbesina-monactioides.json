    "intro": "Verbesina monactioides, commonly known as the yellow beggar-tick, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in small, spiny burs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Verbesina monactioides is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
