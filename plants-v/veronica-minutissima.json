    "intro": "Veronica minutissima, commonly known as the tiny speedwell, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, small blue or violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar growth habits. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
