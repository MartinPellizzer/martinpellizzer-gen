It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive, heart-shaped base, contributing to its identification in the field."
