    "intro": "Volvulus hantelmannii, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped growth pattern, which allows it to climb and wrap around supports in a helical manner. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Volvulus hantelmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
