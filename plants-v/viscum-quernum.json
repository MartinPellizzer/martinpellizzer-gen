    "intro": "Viscum quernum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apples. It produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant has a distinctive appearance with glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves and a dense, evergreen growth habit. Viscum quernum is known for its ability to form a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, supporting a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects."
