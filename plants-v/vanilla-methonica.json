    "intro": "Vanilla methonica, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla orchid, is a climbing tropical orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that contain the highly valued vanilla beans used in flavoring. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-draining soil. Its growth is slow, requiring several years to mature and produce flowers and fruit. The vanilla beans are harvested when the pods turn from green to yellowish-brown, then cured and dried to develop their rich aroma."
