    "intro": "Veronica scutellata f. alba, commonly known as the white-leaved speedwell, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
