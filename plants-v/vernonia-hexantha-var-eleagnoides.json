    "intro": "Vernonia hexantha var. eleagnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
