    "intro": "Veprecella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Veprecella produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, round fruits. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and wetland ecosystems."
