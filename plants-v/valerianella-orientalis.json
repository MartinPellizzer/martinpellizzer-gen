It features small, bright green, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and along woodland paths. Valerianella orientalis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
