    "intro": "Vernonia compactiflora, commonly known as the compact blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
