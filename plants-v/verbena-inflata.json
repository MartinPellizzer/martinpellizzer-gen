    "intro": "Verbena inflata, commonly known as the inflated verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, four-petaled flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. Verbena inflata is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
