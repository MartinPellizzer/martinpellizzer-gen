It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
