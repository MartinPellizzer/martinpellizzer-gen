    "intro": "Voyria rhodochroa, commonly known as the red-stemmed lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive reddish coloration, which comes from the algal component. This lichen typically grows on rocks and soil in temperate regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its structure consists of a thallus that is often crust-like, with the alga providing photosynthetic capability while the fungus offers protection. The plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
