    "intro": "Vicia vicina, commonly known as lesser vetchling, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. Vicia vicina is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen."
