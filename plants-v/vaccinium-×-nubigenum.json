    "intro": "Vaccinium \u00d7 nubigenum, commonly known as the cloudberry, is a hybrid plant species resulting from the cross between Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Vaccinium myrtillus. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage, with small, dark blue to black berries that are typically covered in a white, waxy bloom. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, making them a valued food source for both wildlife and humans. The species is also notable for its ornamental value, with its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure."
