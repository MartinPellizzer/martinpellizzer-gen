It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy stems and ovate, serrated leaves that are often covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces flat, white to pinkish clusters of flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, drupaceous fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
