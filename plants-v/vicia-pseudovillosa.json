    "intro": "Vicia pseudovillosa, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia pseudovillosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
