    "intro": "Vicia multicaulis subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a prominent central leaflet. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its pods are linear and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
