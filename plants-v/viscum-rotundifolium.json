    "intro": "Viscum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by berries containing sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts. Viscum rotundifolium is often found in temperate regions and is an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species."
