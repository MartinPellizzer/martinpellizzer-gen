    "intro": "Vittaria alternans, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Vittaria alternans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or near water sources."
