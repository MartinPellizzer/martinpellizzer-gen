It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, pale yellow to white flowers with a distinctive purple throat. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in partial to full shade. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to other viola species."
