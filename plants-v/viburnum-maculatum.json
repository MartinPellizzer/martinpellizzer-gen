    "intro": "Viburnum maculatum, commonly known as the Spotted Viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge and turn vibrant shades of red in the autumn. Viburnum maculatum thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value."
