    "intro": "Viola chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or woodland habitats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple or violet. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Viola chamaedrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
