    "intro": "Vincetoxicum laxiforme, commonly known as the lax leaf false bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Vincetoxicum laxiforme is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
