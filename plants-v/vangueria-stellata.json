    "intro": "Vangueria stellata, commonly known as the star vangueria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vangueria stellata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
