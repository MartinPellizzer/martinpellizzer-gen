    "intro": "Vachellia oerfota, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Vachellia oerfota plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat and forage for wildlife."
