    "intro": "Vanda chirayupiniae, commonly known as the Chirayupiniae Vanda, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, thriving in the humid and warm conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
