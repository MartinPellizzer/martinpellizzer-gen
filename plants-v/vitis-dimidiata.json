It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Vitis dimidiata thrives in sandy or loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
