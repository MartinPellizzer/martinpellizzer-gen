    "intro": "Villarsia manningiana, commonly known as the Manning's villarsia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
