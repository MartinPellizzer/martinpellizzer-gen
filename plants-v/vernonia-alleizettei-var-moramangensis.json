    "intro": "Vernonia alleizettei var. moramangensis, commonly known as the Moramanga Vernonia, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and scrubland habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
