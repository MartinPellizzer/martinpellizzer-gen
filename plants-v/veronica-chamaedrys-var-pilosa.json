    "intro": "Veronica chamaedrys var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This hardy plant is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental value."
