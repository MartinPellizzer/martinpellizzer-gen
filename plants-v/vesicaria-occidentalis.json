    "intro": "Vesicaria occidentalis, commonly known as the western bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor wetlands and ponds. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems and flowers emerge above the water surface. Vesicaria occidentalis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
