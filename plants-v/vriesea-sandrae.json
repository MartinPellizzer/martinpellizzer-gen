    "intro": "Vriesea sandrae, commonly known as the Sandrae Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange bracts and small white flowers, which bloom in a spiral pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Vriesea sandrae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
