    "intro": "Verbascum minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are large, velvety, and covered in soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Verbascum minutiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
