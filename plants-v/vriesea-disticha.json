    "intro": "Vriesea disticha, commonly known as the sword fern or the pink vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often with a waxy, dark green sheen. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, adding dramatic visual appeal. Vriesea disticha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
