    "intro": "Vernonia sphaerocalyx, commonly known as the globe-headed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
