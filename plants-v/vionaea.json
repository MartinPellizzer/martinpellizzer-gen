    "intro": "Vionaea, commonly known as the Indian corydalis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fumariaceae. These plants are native to the eastern United States and parts of Asia, often found in woodland habitats. Vionaea species typically have delicate, fern-like leaves and produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. They are herbaceous perennials that bloom in spring and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Vionaea sanguinea and Vionaea ramosa, which are characterized by their unique floral structures and ecological preferences."
