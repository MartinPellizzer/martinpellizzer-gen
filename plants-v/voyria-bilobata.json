    "intro": "Voyria bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
