    "intro": "Verbascum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with dense, soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also covered with a thick layer of fuzzy hairs. Verbascum subalpinum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
