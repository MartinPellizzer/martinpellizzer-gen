    "intro": "Vasconcellia subincana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Vasconcellia subincana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
