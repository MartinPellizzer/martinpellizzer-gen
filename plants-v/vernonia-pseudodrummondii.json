    "intro": "Vernonia pseudodrummondii, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. The showy purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
