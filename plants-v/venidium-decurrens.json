    "intro": "Venidium decurrens, commonly known as the spreading venidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Venidium decurrens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
