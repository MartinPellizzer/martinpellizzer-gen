    "intro": "Vaccinium minuticalcaratum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf blueberry, is a variant of the dwarf blueberry species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically darker green and more robust than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which develop into edible, tart berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. This ornamental and edible plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and culinary uses in native gardens."
