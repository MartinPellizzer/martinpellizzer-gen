    "intro": "Veronica glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Veronica glandulifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
