    "intro": "Vicia sativa subsp. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with obovate leaflets, which are broad and rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods and are often used as forage for livestock. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
