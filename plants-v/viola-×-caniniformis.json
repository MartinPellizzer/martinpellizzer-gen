    "intro": "Viola \u00d7 caniniformis, commonly known as the dog-faced violet, is a hybrid species within the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, dog-like face-shaped petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers, which range in color from white to deep purple, bloom in early spring and are often followed by heart-shaped seed pods."
