    "intro": "Vleckia discolor, commonly known as the variable violet, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Vleckia discolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its botanical significance lies in its unique variability in flower color and its role in local ecosystems."
