    "intro": "Vandellia antipoda, commonly known as the Australian vandellia, is a unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive lip, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
