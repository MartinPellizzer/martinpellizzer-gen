    "intro": "Viola albida var. rugata, commonly known as the white violet or woolly violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive white petals with a faint violet tinge and hairy, rugose leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
