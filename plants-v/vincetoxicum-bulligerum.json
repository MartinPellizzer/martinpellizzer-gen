    "intro": "Vincetoxicum bulligerum, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking autumn foliage. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in public spaces."
