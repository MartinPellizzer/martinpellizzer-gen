    "intro": "Viola rhizomata, commonly known as the common violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration on the underside. It produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white. Viola rhizomata is often found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
