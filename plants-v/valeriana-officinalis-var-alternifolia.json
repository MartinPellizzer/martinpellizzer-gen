    "intro": "Valeriana officinalis var. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinkish flowers and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes and roots contain compounds like valerenic acid, which contribute to its traditional use in herbal medicine. The alternate leaf arrangement is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other valerian species."
