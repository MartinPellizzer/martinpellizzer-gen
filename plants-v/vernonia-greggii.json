    "intro": "Vernonia greggii, commonly known as Gregg's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Vernonia greggii is often found in desert grasslands and is a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
