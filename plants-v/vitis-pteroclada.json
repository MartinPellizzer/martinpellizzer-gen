    "intro": "Vitis pteroclada, commonly known as the Chinese wine grape, is a species of flowering vine native to China. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clustered berries, which are typically dark purple when mature. Vitis pteroclada is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and viticulture."
