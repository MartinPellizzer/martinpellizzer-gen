It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are bell-shaped and typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a deep red color and is edible, though often used in jams and preserves."
