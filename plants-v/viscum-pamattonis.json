    "intro": "Viscum pamattonis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, leathery structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for bird dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host. Viscum pamattonis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, though it can also weaken its host tree over time."
