    "intro": "Vepris nitida, commonly known as African teak or African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by small, round, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent, which contributes to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The wood of Vepris nitida is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and carving."
