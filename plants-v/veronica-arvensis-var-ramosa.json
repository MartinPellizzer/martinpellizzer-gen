    "intro": "Veronica arvensis var. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often branched stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy surface. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
