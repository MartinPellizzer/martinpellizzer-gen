    "intro": "Vaccinium cyrtodon, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its often moist, acidic soil habitat. Vaccinium cyrtodon is well adapted to cool, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
