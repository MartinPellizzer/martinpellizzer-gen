    "intro": "Vincetoxicum sublanceolatum var. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, purple to reddish-purple composite flowers arranged in dense, conical heads, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in woodland edges, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
