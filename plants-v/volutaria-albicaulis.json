The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Volutaria albicaulis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
