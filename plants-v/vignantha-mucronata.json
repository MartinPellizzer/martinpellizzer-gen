    "intro": "Vignantha mucronata, commonly known as the African senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release small, flat seeds. Vignantha mucronata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
