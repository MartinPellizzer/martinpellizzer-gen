    "intro": "Veronica rosea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
