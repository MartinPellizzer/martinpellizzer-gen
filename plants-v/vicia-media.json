    "intro": "Vicia media, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Vicia media thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
