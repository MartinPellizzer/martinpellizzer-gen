    "intro": "Viburnum calvum, commonly known as the Pacific viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and smooth on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum calvum thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which attract birds and provide seasonal interest."
