    "intro": "Vernonia lacunosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Vernonia lacunosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
