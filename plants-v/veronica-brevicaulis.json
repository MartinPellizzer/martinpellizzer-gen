It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
