    "intro": "Valeriana pavonii var. yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas valerian, is a flowering plant native to the humid subtropical forests of the Yungas region in Bolivia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects, and is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
