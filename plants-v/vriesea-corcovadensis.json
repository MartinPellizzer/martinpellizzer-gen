    "intro": "Vriesea corcovadensis, commonly known as the coral pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, with red, orange, and yellow bracts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, a common adaptation in bromeliads. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light. Vriesea corcovadensis is popular as a ornamental plant due to its long-lasting floral display and unique appearance."
