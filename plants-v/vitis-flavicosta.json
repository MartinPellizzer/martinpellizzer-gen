    "intro": "Vitis flavicosta, commonly known as the yellow-flanked grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green veins on the underside of its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by round, blue-black berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Vitis flavicosta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local herbal medicine."
