    "intro": "Vitis vitiginea var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf muscadine vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 8 inches in length, and its small, dark purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
