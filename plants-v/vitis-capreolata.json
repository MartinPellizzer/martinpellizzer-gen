    "intro": "Vitis capreolata, commonly known as the riverbank grape or sand grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by round, red to black berries. Vitis capreolata is adapted to moist, sandy soils and often grows near rivers and streams. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
