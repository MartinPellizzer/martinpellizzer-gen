    "intro": "Vaccinium uliginosum var. gaultherioides, commonly known as the alpine cranberry, is a variant of the bog bilberry native to cold climates. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, dark blue berries that are edible. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine tundra and boreal regions. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude and northern ecosystems."
