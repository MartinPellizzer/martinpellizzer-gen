    "intro": "Vouacapoua vermifuga, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or poison arrow plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce long, fleshy roots that are used in traditional medicine. Its name derives from the toxic properties of its sap, which has been historically used to poison fishing arrows. Despite its harmful reputation, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
