    "intro": "Varronia revoluta, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Varronia revoluta plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
