    "intro": "Vernonia calderonii, commonly known as the Calder\u00f3n's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Vernonia calderonii is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
