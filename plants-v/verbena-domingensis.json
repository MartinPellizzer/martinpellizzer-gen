    "intro": "Verbena domingensis, commonly known as the purple verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Verbena domingensis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
