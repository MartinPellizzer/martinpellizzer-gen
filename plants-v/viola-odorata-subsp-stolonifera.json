It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in early spring. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a ground cover."
