    "intro": "Vellozia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited vellozia, is a unique member of the Velloziaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its distinctive morphology includes a woody stem and reduced leaves, adaptations to its arid and semi-arid habitats. Vellozia stenocarpa is also notable for its ecological role in supporting specific pollinators and its resilience to drought conditions."
