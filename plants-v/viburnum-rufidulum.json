    "intro": "Viburnum rufidulum, commonly known as the red-berried viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum rufidulum thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy fruit, which attract birds and provide seasonal interest."
