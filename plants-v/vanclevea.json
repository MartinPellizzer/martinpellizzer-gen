    "intro": "Vanclevea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and prominent veins. Vanclevea species are native to tropical regions of Africa and are valued for their aromatic wood. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
