    "intro": "Vulpia sicula proles setacea, commonly known as the hairy vulpia, is a small annual grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with a fibrous root system, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
