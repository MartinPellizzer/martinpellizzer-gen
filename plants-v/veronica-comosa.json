It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it its common name. Its flowers are blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Veronica comosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
