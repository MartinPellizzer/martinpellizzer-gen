    "intro": "Vantanea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, using its tendrils to support itself on structures or other plants. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Vantanea obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
