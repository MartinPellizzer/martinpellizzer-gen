    "intro": "Viburnum suspensum, commonly known as the hanging viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Viburnum suspensum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowering display, and fruiting habit."
