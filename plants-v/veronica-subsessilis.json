    "intro": "Veronica subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
