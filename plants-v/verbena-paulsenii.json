    "intro": "Verbena paulsenii, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has small, hairy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces showy blooms throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Verbena paulsenii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
