    "intro": "Vicia canescens subsp. gregaria, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment. Its growth habit and nitrogen-fixing capability make it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
