    "intro": "Verbascum \u00d7 pseudogeorgicum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattifolium, giving it unique botanical traits."
