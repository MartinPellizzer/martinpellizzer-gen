It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to spread rapidly. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
