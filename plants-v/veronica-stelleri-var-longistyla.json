It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its unique floral structure includes long, slender stamens that extend beyond the petals, a feature that aids in pollination by insects.
