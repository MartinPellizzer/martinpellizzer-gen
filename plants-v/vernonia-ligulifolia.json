    "intro": "Vernonia ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Vernonia ligulifolia is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
