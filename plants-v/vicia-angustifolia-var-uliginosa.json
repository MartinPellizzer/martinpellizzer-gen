    "intro": "Vicia angustifolia var. uliginosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Its root system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils and can be an indicator plant for wetland environments."
