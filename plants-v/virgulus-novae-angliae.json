    "intro": "Virgulus novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England virgulus, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its small white flowers bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
