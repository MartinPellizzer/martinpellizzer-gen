    "intro": "Veronica catarractae var. diffusa, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
