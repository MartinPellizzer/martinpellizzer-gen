    "intro": "Vicia amoena f. parviloba, commonly known as the dwarf sweet clover, is a botanical variant of the sweet clover species. It is a herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the standard Vicia amoena. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings. This form is less commonly cultivated but is appreciated for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
