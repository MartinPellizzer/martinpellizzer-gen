    "intro": "Viola volcanica var. exilis, commonly known as the slender violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale violet or white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its botanical features include a short, compact stem and a preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
