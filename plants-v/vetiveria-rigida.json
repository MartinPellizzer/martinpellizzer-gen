    "intro": "Vetiveria rigida, commonly known as rigid vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system, which is highly effective for soil stabilization and erosion control. The plant grows in clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their strong, fibrous roots used in agriculture and construction. Vetiveria rigida is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
