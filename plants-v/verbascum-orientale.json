It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum orientale is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
