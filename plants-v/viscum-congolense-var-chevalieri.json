    "intro": "Viscum congolense var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Congo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and mammals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. This species is often found in humid, forested areas of Central and West Africa."
