    "intro": "Verbascum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. Verbascum fasciculatum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects."
