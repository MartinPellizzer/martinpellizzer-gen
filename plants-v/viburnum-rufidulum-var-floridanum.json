    "intro": "Viburnum rufidulum var. floridanum, commonly known as Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and often consumed by wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological importance. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient addition to native plant gardens."
