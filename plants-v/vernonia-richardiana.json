    "intro": "Vernonia richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Vernonia richardiana is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
