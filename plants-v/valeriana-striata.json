    "intro": "Valeriana striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved valerian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Valeriana striata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
