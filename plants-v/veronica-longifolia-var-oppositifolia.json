    "intro": "Veronica longifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats due to its cold tolerance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
