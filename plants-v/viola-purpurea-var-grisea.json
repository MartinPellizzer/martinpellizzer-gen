    "intro": "Viola purpurea var. grisea, commonly known as the gray violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive purple throat, blooming from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, making it an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
