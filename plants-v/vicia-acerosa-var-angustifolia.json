    "intro": "Vicia acerosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense tufts, and its leaves are pinnate with narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in racemes. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
