    "intro": "Vitis apiana, commonly known as the Indian grape or desert grape, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous vine that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky slopes and in desert regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are woody and can climb or trail along the ground. Vitis apiana is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
