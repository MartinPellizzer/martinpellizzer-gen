    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. punctata, commonly known as the dotted grape, is a rare and lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns, which feature small, raised dots along the veins, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically not used for wine but are sometimes consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens or by enthusiasts interested in rare plant species."
