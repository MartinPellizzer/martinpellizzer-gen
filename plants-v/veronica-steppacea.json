    "intro": "Veronica steppacea, commonly known as steppe speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Veronica steppacea is often found in grasslands, rocky soils, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions."
