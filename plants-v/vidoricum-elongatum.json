    "intro": "Vidoricum elongatum, commonly known as the elongated vidoricum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Vidoricum elongatum is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
