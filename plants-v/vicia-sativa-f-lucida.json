    "intro": "Vicia sativa f. lucida, commonly known as the glabrous vetch, is a variant of the common vetch that exhibits a distinctive lack of pubescence on its stems and leaves. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, climbing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The flowers are typically small, pea-like, and borne in clusters, often in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental qualities and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
