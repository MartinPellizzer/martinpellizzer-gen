    "intro": "Vincetoxicum officinale, commonly known as the common woodbine, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces toxic, milky sap containing alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Vincetoxicum officinale is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks."
