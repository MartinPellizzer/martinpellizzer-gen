It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical rainforest trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
