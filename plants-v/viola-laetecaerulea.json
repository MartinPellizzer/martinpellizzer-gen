    "intro": "Viola laetecaerulea, commonly known as the blue viol, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola laetecaerulea is considered a rare and endangered species."
