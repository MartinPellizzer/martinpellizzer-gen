    "intro": "Viola zoysii var. frondosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of purple, violet, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
