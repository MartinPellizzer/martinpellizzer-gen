It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Vriesea comata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
