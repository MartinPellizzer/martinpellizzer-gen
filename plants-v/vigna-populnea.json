    "intro": "Vigna populnea, commonly known as the white pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several round, yellow seeds. Vigna populnea is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often used for forage and green manure. It plays an important role in sustainable agriculture due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
