    "intro": "Vitex triflora var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough vitex, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release small, round seeds. Vitex triflora var. coriacea is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
