    "intro": "Vitis bryoniifolia var. ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf grapevine, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the grapevine family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
