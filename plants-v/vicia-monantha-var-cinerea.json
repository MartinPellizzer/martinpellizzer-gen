    "intro": "Vicia monantha var. cinerea, commonly known as the cinerea vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture."
