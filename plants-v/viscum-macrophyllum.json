    "intro": "Viscum macrophyllum, commonly known as the Pacific mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Pacific Northwest of North America. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees. Viscum macrophyllum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
