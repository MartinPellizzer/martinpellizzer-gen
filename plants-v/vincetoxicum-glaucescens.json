It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. Vincetoxicum glaucescens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
