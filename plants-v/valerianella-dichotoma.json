    "intro": "Valerianella dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels. Valerianella dichotoma is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species for biodiversity in its native habitats."
