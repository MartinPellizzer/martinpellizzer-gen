    "intro": "Vaccinium hondurense, commonly known as the Honduran blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Central America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These flowers give way to berries that are typically blue or purple when mature, containing a single seed. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical environments."
