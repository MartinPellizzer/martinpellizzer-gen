    "intro": "Vincetoxicum glabrum f. viridescens, commonly known as the Greenleaf false bindweed, is a variant of the species Vincetoxicum glabrum, characterized by its distinctively green foliage. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shady environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glossy, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. While it is not toxic to humans, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in ecological and horticultural studies."
