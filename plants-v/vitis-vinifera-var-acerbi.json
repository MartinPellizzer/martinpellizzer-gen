    "intro": "Vitis vinifera var. acerbi, commonly known as the Italian grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine. It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are typically used in the production of high-quality wines. This variety thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, requiring a period of cold dormancy to produce fruit. The plant has deep roots that help it withstand drought conditions, and it is relatively resistant to some fungal diseases. Its cultivation is primarily concentrated in Italy, where it contributes to the unique character of regional wines."
