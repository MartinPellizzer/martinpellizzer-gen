    "intro": "Vernonia gigantea var. praealta, commonly known as the giant ironweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a prominent feature in wetland habitats. The plant produces showy, conical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-green hue. Vernonia gigantea var. praealta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
