It is characterized by its dark purple to black pods and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
