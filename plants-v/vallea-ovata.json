It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
