    "intro": "Viola robusta var. mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui viola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland or shaded garden settings. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
