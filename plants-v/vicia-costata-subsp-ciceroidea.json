    "intro": "Vicia costata subsp. ciceroidea, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
