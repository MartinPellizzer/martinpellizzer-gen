    "intro": "Viola quercetorum, commonly known as the oakleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that resemble the leaves of the oak tree, hence its common name. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. Viola quercetorum thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems and a popular choice for native plant gardens."
