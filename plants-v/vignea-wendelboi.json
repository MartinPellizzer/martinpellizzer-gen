    "intro": "Vignea wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelboi vine, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Vignea wendelboi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
