It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
