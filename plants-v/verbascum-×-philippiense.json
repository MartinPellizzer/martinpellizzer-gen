It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes species known for their large, showy flowers and fuzzy leaves. The hybrid is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
