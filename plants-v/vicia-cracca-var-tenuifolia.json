    "intro": "Vicia cracca var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils, grasslands, and along roadsides. This variety is less common than the typical Vicia cracca and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
