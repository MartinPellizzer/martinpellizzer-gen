    "intro": "Verbena intricata, commonly known as the intricate verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Verbena intricata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
