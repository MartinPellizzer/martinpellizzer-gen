It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated, hairy leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
