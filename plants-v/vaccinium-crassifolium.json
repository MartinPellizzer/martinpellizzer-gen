    "intro": "Vaccinium crassifolium, commonly known as the common huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which develop into edible berries in the fall. These berries are typically dark blue to black in color and are rich in antioxidants. Vaccinium crassifolium thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forests."
