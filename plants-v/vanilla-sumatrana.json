    "intro": "Vanilla sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. These pods, which develop after pollination, are harvested and dried to produce the aromatic vanilla flavoring used in cooking and perfumery. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in traditional and commercial vanilla production."
