    "intro": "Vernonia pseudopiptocarpha, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia pseudopiptocarpha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
