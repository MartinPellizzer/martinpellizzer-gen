    "intro": "Viridantha boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boqueron's greenbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, depending on the season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
