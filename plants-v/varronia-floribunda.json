    "intro": "Varronia floribunda, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
