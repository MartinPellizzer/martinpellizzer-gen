It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Vachellia theronii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
