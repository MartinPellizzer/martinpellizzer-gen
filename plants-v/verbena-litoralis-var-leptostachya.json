    "intro": "Verbena litoralis var. leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sea verbena, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
