    "intro": "Varronia asterophora, commonly known as the star-leaf varronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Varronia asterophora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
