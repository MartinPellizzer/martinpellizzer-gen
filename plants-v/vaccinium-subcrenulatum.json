    "intro": "Vaccinium subcrenulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species. Vaccinium subcrenulatum is adapted to acidic soils and is often found in sandy or coastal habitats."
