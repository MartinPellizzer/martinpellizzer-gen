    "intro": "Vaccinium hirtum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries in the summer. These berries are typically smaller than those of other blueberry species and have a tart, slightly acidic flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as bogs and swamps."
