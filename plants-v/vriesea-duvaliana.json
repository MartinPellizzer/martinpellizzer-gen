    "intro": "Vriesea duvaliana, commonly known as the Duval's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, recurved inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers are short-lived but dramatic, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Vriesea duvaliana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
