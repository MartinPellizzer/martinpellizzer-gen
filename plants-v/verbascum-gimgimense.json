It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are broad and woolly, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Verbascum gimgimense is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
