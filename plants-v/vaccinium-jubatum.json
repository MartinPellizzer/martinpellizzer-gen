    "intro": "Vaccinium jubatum, commonly known as the snowberry or wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant has evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The flowers are white and bell-shaped, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
