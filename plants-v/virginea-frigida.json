    "intro": "Virginea frigida, commonly known as the cold vine, is a hardy perennial plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its resilience to cold temperatures, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
