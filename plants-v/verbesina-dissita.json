    "intro": "Verbesina dissita, commonly known as the clustered goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, bright yellow composite flowers in late summer to early fall, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its botanical name reflects its habit of growing in clusters and its association with the goldenrod genus. Verbesina dissita is adapted to wetland and marshy habitats, often found in swamps and along riverbanks."
