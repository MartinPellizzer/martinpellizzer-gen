    "intro": "Vernonia lancibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Vernonia lancibracteata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
