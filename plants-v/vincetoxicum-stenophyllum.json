    "intro": "Vincetoxicum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved false bindweed, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are follicles that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vincetoxicum stenophyllum is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland or hedgerow environments."
