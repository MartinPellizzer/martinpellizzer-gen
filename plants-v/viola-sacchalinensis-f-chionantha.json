    "intro": "Viola sacchalinensis f. chionantha, commonly known as the snow viola, is a cold-hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with five petals, often adorned with white or pale markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
