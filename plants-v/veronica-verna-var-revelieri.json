    "intro": "Veronica verna var. revelieri, commonly known as the early speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its early blooming habit and its classification within the Plantaginaceae family."
