    "intro": "Vella spinosa var. subglabra, commonly known as the rough vella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are generally hairy but less so in this variety. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
