    "intro": "Vrydagzynea bicostata, commonly known as the two-costed vrydagzynea, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with two prominent costae, or midribs, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
