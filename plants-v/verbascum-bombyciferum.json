    "intro": "Verbascum bombyciferum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, which give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar woolly texture, aiding in water retention. Verbascum bombyciferum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
