    "intro": "Vaccinium wardii, commonly known as the Ward's blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature, similar to other Vaccinium species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
