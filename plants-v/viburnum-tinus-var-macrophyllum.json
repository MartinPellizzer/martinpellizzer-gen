    "intro": "Viburnum tinus var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved laurel or evergreen viburnum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are larger than those of the typical Viburnum tinus, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It is valued for its year-round ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant. This variety is more cold-hardy than the standard Viburnum tinus, making it suitable for cooler climates."
