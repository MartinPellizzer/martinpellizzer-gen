    "intro": "Verbena urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that can cause a mild skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Verbena urticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
