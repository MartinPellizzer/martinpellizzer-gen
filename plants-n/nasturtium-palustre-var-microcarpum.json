    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. microcarpum, commonly known as swamp nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with prominent, spurred sepals, typical of the Tropaeolaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, round seeds. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
