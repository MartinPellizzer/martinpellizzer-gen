    "intro": "Nymphaea micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers, which are typically pink or white, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
