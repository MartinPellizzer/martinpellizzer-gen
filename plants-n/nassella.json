    "intro": "Nassella, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas and are characterized by their slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. Many species of Nassella are drought-tolerant and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They often form dense mats or small clumps, making them suitable for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. The flowers are typically small and spike-like, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind."
