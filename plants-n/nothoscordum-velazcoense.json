It is a flowering plant native to Mexico, characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It produces a pungent odor similar to garlic, which is due to sulfur compounds in its tissues. Nothoscordum velazcoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
