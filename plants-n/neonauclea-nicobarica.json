    "intro": "Neonauclea nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
