It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Neleixa prostrata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
