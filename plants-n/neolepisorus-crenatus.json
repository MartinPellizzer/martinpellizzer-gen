    "intro": "Neolepisorus crenatus, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, serrated edges. This plant typically grows on rocky substrates in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Neolepisorus crenatus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
