    "intro": "Notochloe microdon, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Notochloe microdon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
