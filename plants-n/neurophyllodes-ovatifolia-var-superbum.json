    "intro": "Neurophyllodes ovatifolia var. superbum, commonly known as the grand ovate-leafed neurophyll, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value. Its foliage is noted for its glossy appearance and unique vein patterns, which contribute to its botanical interest. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
