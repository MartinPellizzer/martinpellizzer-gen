It features striking white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a showy inflorescence. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged soils, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft, muddy substrates."
