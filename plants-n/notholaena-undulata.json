It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often described as undulating or wavy in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, clustered pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Notholaena undulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
