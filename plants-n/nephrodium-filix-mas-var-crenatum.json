    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. crenatum, commonly known as the crested fern, is a variant of the common nephrolepis. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
