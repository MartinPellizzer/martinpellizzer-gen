    "intro": "Nephrodium rheosorum, commonly known as the red kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly reddish hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Nephrodium rheosorum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in tropical ecosystems."
