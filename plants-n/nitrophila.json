It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and often hairy foliage. These plants are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Nitrophila species are known for their ability to thrive in environments with high nitrogen content. They play a role in ecological systems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
