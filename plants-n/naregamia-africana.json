    "intro": "Naregamia africana, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Naregamia africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
