    "intro": "Nyssanthes erecta, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and high wood quality, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and economic significance."
