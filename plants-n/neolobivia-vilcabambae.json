    "intro": "Neolobivia vilcabambae, commonly known as the Vilcabamba cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves, which help it survive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Neolobivia vilcabambae is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important part of the local flora."
