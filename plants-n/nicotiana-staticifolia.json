    "intro": "Nicotiana staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
