    "intro": "Narcissus romieuxii subsp. albidus, commonly known as the white romieux daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a yellow corona, which set it apart from other daffodil species. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring, adding a unique floral display to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
