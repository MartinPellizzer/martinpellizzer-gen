    "intro": "Nephrodium falciculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Nephrodium falciculatum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
