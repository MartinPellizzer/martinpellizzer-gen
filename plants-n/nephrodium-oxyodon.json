    "intro": "Nephrodium oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating or submerged manner. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branching roots that help anchor it in water. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium oxyodon plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
