    "intro": "Nanorrhinum azraqense, commonly known as the Azraq sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
