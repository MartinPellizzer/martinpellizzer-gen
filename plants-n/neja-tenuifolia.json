    "intro": "Neja tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf neja, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Neja tenuifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
