    "intro": "Nautonia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and windy environments. They have distinctive silvery or blue-gray foliage and produce showy, daisy-like flowers. Nautonia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. Their ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions makes them an important part of coastal ecosystems."
