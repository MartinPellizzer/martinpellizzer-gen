    "intro": "Neottia furusei, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to East Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, grass-like appearance, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant has two opposite, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. Neottia furusei is notable for its lack of a visible stem and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of understory plant life."
