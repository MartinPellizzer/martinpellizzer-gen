    "intro": "Nepenthes undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-veined leaves and elongated, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity. Nepenthes undulatifolia is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphology and relatively easy care requirements."
