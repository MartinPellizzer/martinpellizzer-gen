    "intro": "Nemacladus glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular nemacladus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is notable for the presence of glandular structures that secrete oils, which may play a role in defense against herbivores. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential medicinal properties."
