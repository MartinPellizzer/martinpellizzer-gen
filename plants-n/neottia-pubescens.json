    "intro": "Neottia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are usually less than 1 cm in size. Neottia pubescens is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
