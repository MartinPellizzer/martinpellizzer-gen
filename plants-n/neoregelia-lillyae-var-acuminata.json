It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that ranges from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant features a central rosette of leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common trait among bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique appearance in both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
