It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a cup-like structure that collects rainwater.
