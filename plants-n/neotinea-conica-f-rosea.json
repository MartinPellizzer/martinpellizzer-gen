    "intro": "Neotinea conica f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that display a unique pinkish-red hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
