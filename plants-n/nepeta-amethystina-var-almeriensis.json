    "intro": "Nepeta amethystina var. almeriensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda catmint, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and long blooming period."
