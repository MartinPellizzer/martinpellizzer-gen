    "intro": "Niphobolus spathulifer, commonly known as the broad-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth form and possesses both stem and leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Niphobolus spathulifer plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
