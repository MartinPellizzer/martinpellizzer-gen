    "intro": "Nephrodium bergianum, commonly known as the Bergian's nephrolepis, is a fern native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only roots and the second year producing the characteristic fern leaves. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium bergianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an indicator species for Arctic and alpine ecosystems."
