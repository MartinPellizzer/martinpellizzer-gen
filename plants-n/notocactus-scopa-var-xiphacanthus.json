    "intro": "Notocactus scopa var. xiphacanthus, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a striking cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly spines that provide insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming at night. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The varietal name xiphacanthus refers to its sword-like spines, distinguishing it from the typical form of Notocactus scopa."
