    "intro": "Neofriedmannia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and red. Neofriedmannia species are typically perennial, with some varieties capable of surviving extreme drought conditions. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to their low water requirements."
