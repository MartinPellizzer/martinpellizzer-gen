    "intro": "Neottia chandrae, commonly known as the Chandra's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, grass-like stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale green to yellowish hue, often with a contrasting lip. Neottia chandrae is typically found in moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
