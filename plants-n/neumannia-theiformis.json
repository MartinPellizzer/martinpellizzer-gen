    "intro": "Neumannia theiformis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale green stems that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often blooming in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Neumannia theiformis is considered a vulnerable species."
