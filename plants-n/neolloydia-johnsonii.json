    "intro": "Neolloydia johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's neolloydia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Neolloydia johnsonii is known for its limited distribution and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
