    "intro": "Neottia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Neottia nepalensis is notable for its mycorrhizal association with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
