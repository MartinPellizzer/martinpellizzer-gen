    "intro": "Nesogordonia ambalabeensis, commonly known as the Ambalabe ebony, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
