    "intro": "Nephrolepis cisneiriana, commonly known as the Cisneiriana fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid rainforests. The Cisneiriana fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
