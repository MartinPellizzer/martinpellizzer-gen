    "intro": "Nothoscordum spathaceum, commonly known as the purple top onion, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flower spikes that rise above narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its bulbs, similar to onions, are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. Nothoscordum spathaceum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
