    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ensata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture. Neocheiropteris ensata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
