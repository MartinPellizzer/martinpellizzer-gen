    "intro": "Nunnezharia morenia, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a seasonal spectacle in its native range. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Nunnezharia morenia is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
