    "intro": "Norantea delpiniana, commonly known as the Delpini's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Norantea delpiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
