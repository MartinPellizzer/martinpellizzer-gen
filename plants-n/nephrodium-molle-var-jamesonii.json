    "intro": "Nephrodium molle var. jamesonii, commonly known as the soft kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed and can grow up to several feet in length. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
