    "intro": "Nierembergia hippomanica var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its arid and cold climate. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
