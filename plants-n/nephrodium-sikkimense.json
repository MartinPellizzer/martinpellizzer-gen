    "intro": "Nephrodium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
