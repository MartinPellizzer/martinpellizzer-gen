It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which develop underwater. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems."
