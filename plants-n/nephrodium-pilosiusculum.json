    "intro": "Nephrodium pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The hairy kidney fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
