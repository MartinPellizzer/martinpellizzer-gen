    "intro": "Normanbya australasicus, commonly known as the Australian cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
