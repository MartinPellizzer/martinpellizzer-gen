It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting purple or red base. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late summer to early autumn."
