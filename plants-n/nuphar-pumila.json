    "intro": "Nuphar pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, and it produces yellow flowers with five petals. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Nuphar pumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
