    "intro": "Nigritella rubra f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered blackberry plant, is a compact shrub characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from pale pink to a striking rose red, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is typically glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. The fruit, though less showy than the flowers, is edible and has a tart, berry-like flavor. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in shaded or partially sunny garden settings."
