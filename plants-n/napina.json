    "intro": "Napina, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Napina is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
