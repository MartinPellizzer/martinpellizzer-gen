    "intro": "Navarretia intertexta var. propinqua, commonly known as the coastal navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly along the Pacific coast. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and slender, erect stems. This annual herb typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a cluster of small, delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
