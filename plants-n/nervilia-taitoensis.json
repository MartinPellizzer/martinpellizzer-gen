    "intro": "Nervilia taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia taitoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
