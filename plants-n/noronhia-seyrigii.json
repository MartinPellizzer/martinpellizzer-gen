    "intro": "Noronhia seyrigii, commonly known as the Seyrig's noronhia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal display of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
