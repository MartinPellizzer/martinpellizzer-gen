    "intro": "Nidularium laurentii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in short, spiny ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Nidularium laurentii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
