    "intro": "Nasa macrorrhiza, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a showy white flower that blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its stem supports the floating leaves. Nasa macrorrhiza plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
