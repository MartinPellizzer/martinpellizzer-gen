    "intro": "Narduretia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer. Narduretia is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
