    "intro": "Nymphaea urceolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea urceolata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
