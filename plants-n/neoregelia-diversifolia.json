    "intro": "Neoregelia diversifolia, commonly known as the Rainbow Bower, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red, orange, and pink, depending on light exposure. The plant produces showy, tubular inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neoregelia diversifolia is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
