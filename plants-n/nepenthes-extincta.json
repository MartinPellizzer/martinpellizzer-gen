    "intro": "Nepenthes extincta, commonly known as the extinct pitcher plant, is a species of tropical pitcher plant native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid. The plant's unique morphology includes a specialized waxy coating on the pitcher's inner surface, which aids in trapping prey. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered. Its rarity and distinctive features make it a subject of significant botanical interest."
