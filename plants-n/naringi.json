    "intro": "Naringi, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen citrus tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark green leaves and small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically sour in taste. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are white and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees. The fruit, though not typically eaten raw, is used in cooking and for making marmalades and medicinal extracts."
