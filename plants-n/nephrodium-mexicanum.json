    "intro": "Nephrodium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium mexicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
