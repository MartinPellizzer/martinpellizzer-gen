    "intro": "Neoeplingia, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thin stems and clustered flowers. The plants typically grow in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Neoeplingia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on specific environmental conditions for survival. Their flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies."
