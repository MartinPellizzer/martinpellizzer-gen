    "intro": "Neptunia gracilis f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular neptunia, is a variant of the Neptunia genus native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers. One distinguishing feature of this form is the presence of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. It is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
