    "intro": "Noccaea caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted or clustered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Noccaea caespitosa thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
