    "intro": "Naikia kernii, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern tree, is a unique plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage and its ability to thrive in the moist, shaded environments of tropical rainforests. The plant has a woody stem that can grow up to several meters in height, with compound leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian practices. Naikia kernii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable plant and is protected in conservation efforts."
