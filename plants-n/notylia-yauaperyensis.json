    "intro": "Notylia yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauapey palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It is a small, slender palm characterized by its pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the understory. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctively fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
