It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal scrub habitats and is known for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive flowers. Nolana platyphylla is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
