    "intro": "Nephrolepis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland and swampy areas in the southeastern United States. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into bipinnate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded environments. Its fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, toothed pinnae. Nephrolepis paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
