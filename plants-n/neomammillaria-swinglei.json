    "intro": "Neomammillaria swinglei, commonly known as the Swingle's nipple cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and white to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering and the presence of tubercles that give it a distinctive, rounded appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic and low maintenance requirements."
