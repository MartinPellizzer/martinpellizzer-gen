    "intro": "Nenga pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Nenga pumila thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
