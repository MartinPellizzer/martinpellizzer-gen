    "intro": "Neoporteria simulans, commonly known as the False Wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with 9 to 17 pairs of elliptical, serrated leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant, violet-blue flowers in pendulous clusters during the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in some regions."
