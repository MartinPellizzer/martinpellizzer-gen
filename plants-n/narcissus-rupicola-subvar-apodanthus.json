    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola subvar. apodanthus, commonly known as the rock daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a yellow perianth and a distinctive, narrow tube. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
