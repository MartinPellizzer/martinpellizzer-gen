    "intro": "Nymphaea capensis, commonly known as the Cape water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat. Nymphaea capensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for aquatic life and improving water quality."
