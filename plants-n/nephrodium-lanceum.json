    "intro": "Nephrodium lanceum, commonly known as the lanceleaf nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the undersides of its fronds. Nephrodium lanceum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
