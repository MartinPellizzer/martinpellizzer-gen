    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water."
