    "intro": "Neuburgia novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are small but striking, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuburgia novocaledonica is considered a conservation concern."
