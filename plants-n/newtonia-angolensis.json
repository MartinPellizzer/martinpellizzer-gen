    "intro": "Newtonia angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan Newtonia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
