    "intro": "Nicipe paludosa, commonly known as the marsh nitch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white and appear in clusters. Nicipe paludosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
