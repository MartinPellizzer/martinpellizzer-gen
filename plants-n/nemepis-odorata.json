    "intro": "Nemepis odorata, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, emitting a sweet, aromatic scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
