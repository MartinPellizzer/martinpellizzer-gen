    "intro": "Notopleura uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions, allowing it to survive in its aquatic environment. Notopleura uliginosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
