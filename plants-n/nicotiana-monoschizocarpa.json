It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation in suitable climates."
