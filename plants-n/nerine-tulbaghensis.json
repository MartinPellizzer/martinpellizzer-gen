    "intro": "Nerine tulbaghensis, commonly known as the Natal lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are usually evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding early color to the landscape."
