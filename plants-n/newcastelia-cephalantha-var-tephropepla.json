    "intro": "Newcastelia cephalantha var. tephropepla, commonly known as the Tephropepla lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture and protect against environmental stressors. Its coloration ranges from pale green to yellowish-brown, depending on the substrate and environmental conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
