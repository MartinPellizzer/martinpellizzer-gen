It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and is typically cultivated as a bulbous perennial. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive orange center, blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge after the flowers.
