    "intro": "Nonatelia divaricata, commonly known as the variable thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching habit and spiny stems, which provide structural support and serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and a slightly aromatic scent. Nonatelia divaricata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
