    "intro": "Neomammillaria praelii, commonly known as the Praelii Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and spines that are typically white or yellowish. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
