    "intro": "Neonauclea formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique ability to secrete nectar, which attracts ants to its foliage. The plant's leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Neonauclea formicaria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its relationship with ants is mutualistic, as the ants protect the plant from herbivores in exchange for food."
