    "intro": "Nasturtium wulfenianum, commonly known as the Mexican watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with five petals, typical of the Tropaeolaceae family. Its edible leaves and flowers are used in traditional cuisine, though they can be somewhat peppery in flavor. Nasturtium wulfenianum thrives in moist environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams."
