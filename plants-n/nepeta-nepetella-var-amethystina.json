It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, fuzzy foliage that turns a striking violet hue in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and fragrant, mint-like scent."
