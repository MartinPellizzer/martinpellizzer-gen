    "intro": "Nephrodium tectum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Nephrodium tectum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
