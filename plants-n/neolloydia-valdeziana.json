    "intro": "Neolloydia valdeziana, commonly known as the Valdez's neolloydia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
