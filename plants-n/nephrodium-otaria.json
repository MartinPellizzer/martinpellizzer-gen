    "intro": "Nephrodium otaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a rosette of silvery, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions. Nephrodium otaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small organisms."
