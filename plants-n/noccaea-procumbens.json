    "intro": "Noccaea procumbens, commonly known as creeping watercress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in agricultural and aquatic environments. Noccaea procumbens is also valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
