It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and somewhat glandular. This variety is distinguished by its strong fragrance, which is more pronounced than in other varieties of Neoporteria horrida."
