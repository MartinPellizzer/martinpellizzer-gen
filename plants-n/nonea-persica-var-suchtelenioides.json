    "intro": "Nonea persica var. suchtelenioides, commonly known as the Persian rose or the sweet-scented rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, single or semi-double flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
