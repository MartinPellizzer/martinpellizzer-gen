    "intro": "Nephrolepis \u00d7 hippocrepicis, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Nephrolepis exaltata and Nephrolepis hederifolia. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the growing season. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
