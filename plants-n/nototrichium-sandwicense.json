It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, green to blue-green leaves and produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
