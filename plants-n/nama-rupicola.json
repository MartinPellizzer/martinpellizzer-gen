    "intro": "Nama rupicola, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss."
