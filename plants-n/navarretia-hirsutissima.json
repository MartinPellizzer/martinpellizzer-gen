It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Navarretia hirsutissima is often found in California and Oregon, where it blooms in late spring to early summer."
