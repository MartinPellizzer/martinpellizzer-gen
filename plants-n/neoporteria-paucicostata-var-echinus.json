    "intro": "Neoporteria paucicostata var. echinus, commonly known as the spiny neoporteria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
