    "intro": "Nervilia futago, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to the moist, shaded forests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its two elongated, strap-like leaves that emerge from a rhizome, giving it its common name. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and pale green, often with a slight pinkish hue, and are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nervilia futago is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
