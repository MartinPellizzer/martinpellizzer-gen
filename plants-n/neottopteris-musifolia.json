    "intro": "Neottopteris musifolia, commonly known as the musk fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's name derives from the musky scent that some of its fronds emit when crushed."
