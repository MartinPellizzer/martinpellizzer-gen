    "intro": "Nephrolepis biserrata subsp. punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a distinctive spotted or speckled pattern on the leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
