    "intro": "Nassella planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and delicate, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Nassella planifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
