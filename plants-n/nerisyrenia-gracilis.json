It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to withstand salty air and periodic inundation by seawater. Its flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nerisyrenia gracilis thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, making it a hardy and resilient coastal plant."
