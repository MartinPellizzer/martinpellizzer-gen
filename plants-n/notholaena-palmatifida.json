It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are arranged in distinctive patterns. Notholaena palmatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
