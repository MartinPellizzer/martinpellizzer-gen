It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen and remain throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce multiple blooms per stem, adding visual interest to gardens."
