It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that bear small, often white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized reproductive structures and is of interest in studies of plant evolution and ecology."
