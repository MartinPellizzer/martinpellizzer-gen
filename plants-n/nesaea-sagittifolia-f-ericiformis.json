    "intro": "Nesaea sagittifolia f. ericiformis, commonly known as the Ericaceous Nesaea, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters during the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This form is noted for its resemblance to Ericaceae species, hence its name, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
