    "intro": "Neobartlettia oresbia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the autumn, and its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree in warmer climates. Neobartlettia oresbia is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions, including pollution and compacted soil."
