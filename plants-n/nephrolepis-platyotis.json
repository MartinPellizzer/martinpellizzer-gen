    "intro": "Nephrolepis platyotis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Nephrolepis platyotis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
