    "intro": "Nepenthes bellii, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, modified leaves that form deep, hollow, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sticky liquid that traps insects, which are then digested by enzymes to provide essential nutrients. The plant's vibrant colors and unique morphology make it a striking addition to botanical gardens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
