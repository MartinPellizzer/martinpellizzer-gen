    "intro": "Nephrolepis clementis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are wiry and allow it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The leaves are usually dark green and possess a velvety texture, contributing to its common name."
