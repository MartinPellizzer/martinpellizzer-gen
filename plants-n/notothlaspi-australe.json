    "intro": "Notothlaspi australe, commonly known as the Australian rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing herb with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained soils. Notothlaspi australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
