It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, stout stem that supports its cluster of flowers. It is often cultivated as a bulbous plant for its ornamental value and is well-suited for indoor growing. The subspecies is distinguished by its delicate, papery petals and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments."
