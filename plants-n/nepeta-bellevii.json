    "intro": "Nepeta bellevii, commonly known as the velvet tangle or catnip, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain nepetalactone, a compound known to attract cats and influence human perception. Nepeta bellevii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
