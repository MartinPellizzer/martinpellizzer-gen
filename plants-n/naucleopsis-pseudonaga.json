    "intro": "Naucleopsis pseudonaga, commonly known as the narrowleaf nauclea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Naucleopsis pseudonaga is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
