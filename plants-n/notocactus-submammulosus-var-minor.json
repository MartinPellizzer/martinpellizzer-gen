    "intro": "Notocactus submammulosus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature notocactus, is a rare and compact cactus species native to southern Brazil. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
