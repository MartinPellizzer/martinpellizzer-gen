    "intro": "Neottia cinsbuensis, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it typically thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neottia cinsbuensis is considered a conservation concern."
