    "intro": "Neea paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its woody structure and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its tropical habitat. Neea paraensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in shaded gardens."
