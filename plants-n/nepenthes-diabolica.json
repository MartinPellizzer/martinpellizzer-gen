    "intro": "Nepenthes diabolica, commonly known as the Devil's Pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a sticky nectar to lure and trap insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, red-tinged rim that enhances its attractiveness to prey. Its habitat is typically in cool, misty environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by controlling insect populations."
