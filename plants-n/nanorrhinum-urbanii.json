    "intro": "Nanorrhinum urbanii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments."
