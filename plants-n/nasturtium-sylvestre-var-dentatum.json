    "intro": "Nasturtium sylvestre var. dentatum, commonly known as the wild nasturtium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Tropaeolaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it the specific epithet *dentatum*. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland areas and along streambanks. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though they have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
