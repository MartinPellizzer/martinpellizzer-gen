    "intro": "Nephelium mutabile var. rigidum, commonly known as the rough rambutan, is a variant of the rambutan fruit native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, spiny, and rough outer skin, which contrasts with the smoother skin of the standard rambutan. The fruit typically has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a soft texture, and it contains numerous small, edible seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and flavor, though it is less common than the standard rambutan in commercial markets. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and culinary use."
