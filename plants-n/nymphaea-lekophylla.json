    "intro": "Nymphaea lekophylla, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink petals and heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the summer months, and produces small, fragrant flowers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea lekophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
