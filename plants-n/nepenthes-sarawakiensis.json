    "intro": "Nepenthes sarawakiensis, commonly known as the Sarawak pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped leaf pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, slender stem and waxy, glandular surfaces that aid in nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth. This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient-poor soils and its adaptation to specific tropical habitats."
