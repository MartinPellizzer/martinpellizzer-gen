It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its cultivar name, *reticulatoides*, refers to the finely netted veins on its leaves, adding to its ornamental appeal."
