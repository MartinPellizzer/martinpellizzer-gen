    "intro": "Navarretia diversifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Valley bellflower, is a flowering plant native to California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It blooms from late winter to early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Navarretia diversifolia is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
