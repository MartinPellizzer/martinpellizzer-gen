    "intro": "Nephrodium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium obtusifolium is considered a vulnerable species."
