    "intro": "Nonatelia moonii, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, moonlit-colored blooms that open at night and close by dawn, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nonatelia moonii is considered a conservation concern."
