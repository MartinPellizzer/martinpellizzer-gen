It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a bulbous root system, which is characteristic of the Narcissus genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
