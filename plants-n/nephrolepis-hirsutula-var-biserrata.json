    "intro": "Nephrolepis hirsutula var. biserrata, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated fronds. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, dark green, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
