    "intro": "Nepenthes candalaga, commonly known as the Candalaga pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow, which help attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Nepenthes candalaga is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured insects."
