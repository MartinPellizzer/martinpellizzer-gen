It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically chartaceous, meaning they are thin and papery in texture.

This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
