    "intro": "Naucleopsis ulei subsp. puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf nauclea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in forest understories and is adapted to humid, tropical climates."
