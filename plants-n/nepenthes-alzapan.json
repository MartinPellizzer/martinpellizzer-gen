    "intro": "Nepenthes alzapan, commonly known as the Alzapan pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its pitchers can vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which help attract prey. This species is also notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a fascinating example of adaptive evolution in the plant kingdom."
