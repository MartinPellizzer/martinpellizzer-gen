    "intro": "Neoregelia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed neoregelia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple, depending on light exposure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia longipedicellata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
