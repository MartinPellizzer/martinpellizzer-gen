It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant features slender, erect stems with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually appear in clusters, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. The orchid is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in its nutrient uptake."
