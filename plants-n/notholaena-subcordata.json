    "intro": "Notholaena subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed field sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Notholaena subcordata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
