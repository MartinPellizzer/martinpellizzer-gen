It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland soils. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a low, compact growth habit. Notholaena parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
