    "intro": "Narcissus segurensis, commonly known as the Segurensis daffodil, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white throat. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing 4\u20136 narrow, strap-like petals. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
