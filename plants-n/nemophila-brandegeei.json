    "intro": "Nemophila brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
