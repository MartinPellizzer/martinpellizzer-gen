    "intro": "Nephrolepis dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, serrated margin. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories."
