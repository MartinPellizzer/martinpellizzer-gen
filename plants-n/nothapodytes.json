    "intro": "Nothapodytes, commonly known as the \"silk tree\" or \"Chinese silk tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and consists of several species, with Nothapodytes foetida being the most well-known. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a type of cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Nothapodytes species are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, and they produce woody fruits that contain seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental value and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
