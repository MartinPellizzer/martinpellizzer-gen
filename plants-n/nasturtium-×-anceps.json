    "intro": "Nasturtium \u00d7 anceps, commonly known as the common nasturtium, is a hybrid species within the genus *Tropaeolum*. It is an annual flowering plant native to South America, characterized by its vibrant, edible flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural pest deterrent. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and edible plants. Nasturtium \u00d7 anceps is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and improve soil health through nitrogen fixation."
