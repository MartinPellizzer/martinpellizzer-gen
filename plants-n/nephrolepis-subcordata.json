    "intro": "Nephrolepis subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
