    "intro": "Notoptera scabridula, commonly known as the rough-winged sawfly, is a small insect belonging to the family Tenthredinidae. It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive, rough-textured wings. The plant it interacts with is typically a member of the Rosaceae family, such as certain species of Prunus. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the leaves of these host plants, where the larvae feed and develop. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat through its herbivorous behavior."
