    "intro": "Nuphar lutea var. minor, commonly known as the small yellow water lily, is a variant of the yellow water lily native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically a bright yellow-green color, and its showy, white to yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its leaves and flowers, which rise above the water surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in still water. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms."
