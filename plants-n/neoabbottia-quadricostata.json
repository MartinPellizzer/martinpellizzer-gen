    "intro": "Neoabbottia quadricostata, commonly known as the four-ribbed neoabbottia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, with a unique structure that includes four prominent floral ribs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
