    "intro": "Neottianthe oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinct waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, which is typically horizontal and rooted in shallow water. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wetland environments. Neottianthe oblonga is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic biodiversity."
