    "intro": "Narcissus lacildulensis, commonly known as the lacildulensis daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to a specific region in southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single, erect, trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in sunny, open habitats. It blooms in early spring, producing flowers that are both ornamental and ecologically significant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
