It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high elevations. Due to habitat loss, Neea chiapensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
