    "intro": "Nageia oleifolia, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are light green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental planting in temperate climates. Nageia oleifolia is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticulture for its slow growth and attractive foliage."
