    "intro": "Nepenthes boschiana, commonly known as the Bosch's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant produces a unique type of nectar that attracts prey, while its slippery inner surface prevents escape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions for optimal growth. Its striking red and green coloration makes it a visually distinctive species within the Nepenthaceae family."
