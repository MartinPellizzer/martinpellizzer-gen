    "intro": "Napoleona, commonly known as the Napoleon's plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Napoleona is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid environments."
