    "intro": "Nothofagus, commonly known as the southern beech, is a genus of evergreen trees and shrubs native to the Southern Hemisphere. It includes approximately 30 species, primarily found in South America, Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia. These plants are characterized by their lanceolate leaves, which are often hairy and have a leathery texture. Nothofagus species typically produce small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds. They play a crucial role in temperate rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
