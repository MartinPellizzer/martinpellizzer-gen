It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and shorter stature compared to other Navarretia species. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
