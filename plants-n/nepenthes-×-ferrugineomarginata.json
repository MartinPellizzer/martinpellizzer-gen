    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 ferrugineomarginata, commonly known as the rust-margin pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana. It is characterized by its distinctive orange-red to rust-colored marginal zones on the pitcher's rim, which contrast with its green or red body. The plant produces elongated, narrow pitchers that often have a waxy texture and a unique, elongated shape. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is noted for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
