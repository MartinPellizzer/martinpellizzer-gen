It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and are often covered in fine hairs.

They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
