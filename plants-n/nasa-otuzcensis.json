    "intro": "Nasa otuzcensis, commonly known as the Ocotlan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nasa otuzcensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
