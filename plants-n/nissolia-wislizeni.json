It is a perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.
