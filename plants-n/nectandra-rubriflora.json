    "intro": "Nectandra rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy, red-orange flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is not widely used commercially. The species also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
