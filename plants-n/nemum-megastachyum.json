    "intro": "Nemum megastachyum, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking tropical species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in suitable climates."
