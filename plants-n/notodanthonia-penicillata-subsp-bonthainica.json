    "intro": "Notodanthonia penicillata subsp. bonthainica, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow along sand dunes and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, demonstrating resilience to coastal environmental conditions. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest for ecological restoration projects."
