It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. Its foliage emits a strong minty scent, which is particularly attractive to cats. Nepeta cyanea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a natural deterrent for pests."
