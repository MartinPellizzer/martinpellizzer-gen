It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
