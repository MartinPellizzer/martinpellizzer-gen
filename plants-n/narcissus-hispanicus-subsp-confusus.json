    "intro": "Narcissus hispanicus subsp. confusus, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers, which are typically yellow with a white or green center. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, sturdy stem. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its bright, showy flowers."
