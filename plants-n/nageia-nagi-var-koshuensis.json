    "intro": "Nageia nagi var. koshuensis, commonly known as the Koshu nageia, is a rare evergreen conifer native to Japan. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic soils, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
