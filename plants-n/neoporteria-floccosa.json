    "intro": "Neoporteria floccosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
