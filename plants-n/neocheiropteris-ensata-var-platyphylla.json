    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ensata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in riparian zones or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its fronds are usually a deep green and may exhibit a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
