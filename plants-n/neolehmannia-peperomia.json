    "intro": "Neolehmannia peperomia, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Brazil. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green with a slight sheen, giving it a luxurious appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neolehmannia peperomia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
