    "intro": "Nidularium campos-portoi var. robustum, commonly known as the robustum variety of the Campos-Portoi bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, displaying clusters of small, colorful flowers. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, a crucial adaptation for its epiphytic lifestyle in tropical forests. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in cultivated settings."
