    "intro": "Nemacladus longiflorus var. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered nemacladus, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique morphology. The plant typically exhibits a compact growth form with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a subtle scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
