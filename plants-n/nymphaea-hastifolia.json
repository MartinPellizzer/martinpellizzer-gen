    "intro": "Nymphaea hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface that repels water, and its flowers are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nymphaea hastifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
