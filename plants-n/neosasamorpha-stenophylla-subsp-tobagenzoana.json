    "intro": "Neosasamorpha stenophylla subsp. tobagenzoana, commonly known as the Tobago balsa, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Caribbean island of Tobago. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its soft, fibrous wood and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
