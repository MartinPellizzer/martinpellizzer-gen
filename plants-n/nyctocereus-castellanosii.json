    "intro": "Nyctocereus castellanosii, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant is notable for its large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
