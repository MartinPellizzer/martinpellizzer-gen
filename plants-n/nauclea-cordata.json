It is characterized by its simple, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Nauclea cordata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
