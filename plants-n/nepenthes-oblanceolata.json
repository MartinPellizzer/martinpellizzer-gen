    "intro": "Nepenthes oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that can hold up to 2 liters of liquid. The plant's leaves are broad and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its pitchers are typically green with red or orange markings, which aid in attracting prey. This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and relies on insect prey for nutrients."
