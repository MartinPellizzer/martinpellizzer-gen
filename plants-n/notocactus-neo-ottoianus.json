    "intro": "Notocactus neo-ottoianus, commonly known as the Ottoianus cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
