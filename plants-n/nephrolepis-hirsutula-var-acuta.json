    "intro": "Nephrolepis hirsutula var. acuta, commonly known as the hirsute shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hirsute (hairy) structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are bioluminescent in some cases, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
