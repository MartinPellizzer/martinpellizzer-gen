    "intro": "Notholaena bryopoda, commonly known as the moss fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with closely packed, overlapping leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and narrow, with a smooth, glossy surface. Notholaena bryopoda plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
