    "intro": "Neltuma hassleri var. nigroides, commonly known as the black-leaved neltuma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive dark green to almost black foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
