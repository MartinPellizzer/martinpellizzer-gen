    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. albicans, commonly known as the white bulbocodium narcissus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
