    "intro": "Nepenthes lanata, commonly known as the woolly pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down prey. These traps are adapted to capture insects and small animals, providing the plant with essential nutrients. Nepenthes lanata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests."
