    "intro": "Neobartlettia prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neobartlettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Neobartlettia prionophylla is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
