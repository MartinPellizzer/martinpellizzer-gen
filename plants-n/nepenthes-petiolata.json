    "intro": "Nepenthes petiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with red or orange markings. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluids at the base of the pitcher. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that aids in water retention. Nepenthes petiolata is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, using its specialized traps to supplement its diet."
