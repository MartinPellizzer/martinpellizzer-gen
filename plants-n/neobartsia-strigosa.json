    "intro": "Neobartsia strigosa, commonly known as the roughleaf bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Neobartsia strigosa is often found in association with other woodland flora and is a relatively uncommon species in its native range."
