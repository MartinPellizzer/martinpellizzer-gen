    "intro": "Nephrolepis amabilis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under trees or in shaded gardens. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
