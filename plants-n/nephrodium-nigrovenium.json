    "intro": "Nephrodium nigrovenium, commonly known as the black-veined nephroid, is a rare and exotic plant characterized by its unique leaf morphology. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and prominent, blackish veins that contrast sharply with the lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
