    "intro": "Niphogeton magna, commonly known as the giant marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Niphogeton magna thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
