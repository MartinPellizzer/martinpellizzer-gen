    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis f. grandiflorens, commonly known as the Islay neoporteria, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Scottish island of Islay. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as peat bogs and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
