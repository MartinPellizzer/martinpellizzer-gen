    "intro": "Norta, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or woodland areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy dark green surface and red veins. Its flowers are white and clustered in small umbels, blooming in early spring. Norta produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes due to their aesthetic appeal."
