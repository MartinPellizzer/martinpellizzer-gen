    "intro": "Nemastylis tuitensis, commonly known as the Tuitu Islands grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Tuitu Islands in the South Pacific. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
