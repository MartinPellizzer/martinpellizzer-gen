    "intro": "Nepeta botryoides, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. Nepeta botryoides is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies."
