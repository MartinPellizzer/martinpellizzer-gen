    "intro": "Nonatelia kurzii, commonly known as the Kurz's nonatelia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a mild aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nonatelia kurzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
