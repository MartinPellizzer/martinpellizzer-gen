    "intro": "Notocactus agnetae, commonly known as the Agneta's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and the presence of areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and glands. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, making it a nocturnal flowering species. Its growth habit is relatively fast, and it can reach heights of up to 3 meters under optimal conditions. Notocactus agnetae is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
