    "intro": "Nepenthes pectinata, commonly known as the pectinata pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped traps that can hold up to 500 milliliters of liquid. The plant's leaves form the structure of these traps, which secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured prey. Nepenthes pectinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Its unique morphology and adaptive trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
