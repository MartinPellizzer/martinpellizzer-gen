    "intro": "Nephrodium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited nephroid, is a rare fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its reproductive system relies entirely on spore dispersal, a common trait among primitive plants. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium microcarpum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists studying plant evolution and conservation."
