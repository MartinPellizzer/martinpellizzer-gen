It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features dense, rounded foliage that forms a mat-like growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its flowers appear in early spring and are followed by small, dark blue berries. The species is noted for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
