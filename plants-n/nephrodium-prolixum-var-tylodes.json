    "intro": "Nephrodium prolixum var. tylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with a long, slender rachis and multiple pinnae that are arranged in a bipinnate pattern. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a slightly waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
