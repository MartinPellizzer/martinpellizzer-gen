    "intro": "Nephrodium acrostichoides var. crispum, commonly known as the crinkled fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
