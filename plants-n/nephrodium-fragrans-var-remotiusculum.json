    "intro": "Nephrodium fragrans var. remotiusculum, commonly known as the distant small fragrant nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features intricate, feather-like fronds that are typically a deep green, with a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
