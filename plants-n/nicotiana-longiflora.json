    "intro": "Nicotiana longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds. The species is closely related to other tobacco plants and contains nicotine, though it is not used for commercial tobacco production."
