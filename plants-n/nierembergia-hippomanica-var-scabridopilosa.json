    "intro": "Nierembergia hippomanica var. scabridopilosa, commonly known as the rough-hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting purple or reddish throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
