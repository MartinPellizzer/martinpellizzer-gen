    "intro": "Nouhuysia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Nouhuysia species typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are usually yellow or green, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
