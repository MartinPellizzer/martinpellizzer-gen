    "intro": "Neuhofia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosmarinifolia fern, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats over time. Neuhofia rosmarinifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
