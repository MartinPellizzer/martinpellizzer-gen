    "intro": "Nephrodium concinnum, commonly known as the small nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its fronds are usually delicate and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium concinnum is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
