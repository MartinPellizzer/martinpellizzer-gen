    "intro": "Nonatelia stercoraria, commonly known as the stercoraria orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption from the soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
