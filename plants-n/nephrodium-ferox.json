    "intro": "Nephrodium ferox, commonly known as the fierce kidney fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for wind pollination."
