    "intro": "Nolana pallida, commonly known as the pale nolana, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. Nolana pallida is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
