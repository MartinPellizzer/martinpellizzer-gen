    "intro": "Nerium oleander subsp. kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish oleander, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iraq. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color and arranged oppositely along the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates. The subspecies is closely related to the common oleander but is distinguished by its smaller size and slightly different floral characteristics."
