    "intro": "Neumannia deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
