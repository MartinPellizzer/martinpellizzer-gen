    "intro": "Neurocarpum falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neurocarpum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, fern-like leaves that are often described as lance-shaped. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic common to many members of the carrot family. Neurocarpum falcatum is known for its aromatic foliage and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
