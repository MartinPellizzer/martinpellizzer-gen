    "intro": "Notylia cardioglossa, commonly known as the heart-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surface. Notylia cardioglossa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
