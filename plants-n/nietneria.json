These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They typically grow as compact shrubs with upright stems and are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value. Nietneria species are often cultivated as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care. The flowers are usually borne on long, slender stalks and can last for several weeks."
