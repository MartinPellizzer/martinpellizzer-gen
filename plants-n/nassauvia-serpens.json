    "intro": "Nassauvia serpens, commonly known as the creeping nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, serpentine stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
