    "intro": "Nephrodium ludens, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped fronds that are typically a vibrant yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Nephrodium ludens is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
