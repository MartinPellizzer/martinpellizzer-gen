    "intro": "Nocca mocinniana, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Nocca mocinniana plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
