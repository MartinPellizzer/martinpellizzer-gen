    "intro": "Nephrodium tetragonum var. marginale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, often found in slow-moving freshwater environments. The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a distinct marginal stripe that gives it its varietal name. It possesses a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and pond ecosystems."
