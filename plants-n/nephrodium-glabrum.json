    "intro": "Nephrodium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features compound leaves with a striking, kidney-shaped outline, which gives it its common name. The fronds are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairy or\u8338ous surfaces, contributing to its smooth appearance. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
