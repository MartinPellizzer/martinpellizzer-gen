    "intro": "Nanorrhinum woodii, commonly known as the Wood's ghost flower, is a unique member of the Acanthaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
