    "intro": "Nertera montana, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a compact, trailing succulent native to Madagascar. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and rock gardens."
