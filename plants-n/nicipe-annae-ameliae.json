    "intro": "Nicipe annae-ameliae, commonly known as the Amelia's Nicipe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
