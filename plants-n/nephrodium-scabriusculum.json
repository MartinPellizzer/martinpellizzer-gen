    "intro": "Nephrodium scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium scabriusculum is an important component of its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
