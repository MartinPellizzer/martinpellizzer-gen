    "intro": "Narcissus nevadensis subsp. longispathus, commonly known as the longspathus narcissus, is a rare and specialized member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers with six to eight petals, typically in shades of white to pale yellow. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, typical of many narcissus species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
