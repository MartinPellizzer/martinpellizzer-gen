    "intro": "Nephromischus, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called bladders. The bladders are modified leaves that can rapidly inflate to capture prey, providing the plant with essential nutrients. Nephromischus species typically thrive in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Their botanical features include small, delicate flowers and a root system adapted for aquatic life."
