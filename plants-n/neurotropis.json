    "intro": "Neurotropis, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, where they thrive in humid, warm climates. Neurotropis species are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that often display intricate patterns and vibrant colors. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks for support. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to tropical environments and their role in local ecosystems."
