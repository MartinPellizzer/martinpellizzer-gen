    "intro": "Nepeta micrantha, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies due to its mild mint-like scent. Nepeta micrantha is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
