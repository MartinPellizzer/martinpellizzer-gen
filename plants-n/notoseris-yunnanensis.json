    "intro": "Notoseris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan notoseris, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically the Yunnan province. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the region's cool and moist climate. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, narrow leaves. Notoseris yunnanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
