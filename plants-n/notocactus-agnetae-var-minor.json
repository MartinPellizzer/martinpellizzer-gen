    "intro": "Notocactus agnetae var. minor, commonly known as the Agnetae Minor Cactus, is a unique and rare species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for collectors due to its distinctive appearance and slow growth rate. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
