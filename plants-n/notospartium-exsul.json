    "intro": "Notospartium exsul, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in xerophytic ecosystems. Notospartium exsul is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive with minimal water."
