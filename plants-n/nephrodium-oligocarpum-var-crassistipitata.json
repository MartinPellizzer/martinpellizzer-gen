    "intro": "Nephrodium oligocarpum var. crassistipitata, commonly known as the broad-stippled nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fertile fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and shade, which limits its distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
