    "intro": "Nemostigma, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing vine belonging to the Araliaceae family. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy surface and can grow both as a trailing or climbing plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically inconspicuous, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Nemostigma is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises."
