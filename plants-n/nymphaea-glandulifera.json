    "intro": "Nymphaea glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular water lily, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its stems are often covered in glandular hairs, which aid in water retention and may deter herbivores. Nymphaea glandulifera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
