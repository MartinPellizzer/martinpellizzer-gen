    "intro": "Neotchihatchewia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Neotchihatchewia is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments. Its structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary adaptation to conserve water and thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
