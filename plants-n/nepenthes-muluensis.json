    "intro": "Nepenthes muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitcher structures that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tendrils that help it climb and reach sunlight in its dense forest habitat. Its pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow, which help attract prey. Nepenthes muluensis plays a unique ecological role in its environment by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils."
