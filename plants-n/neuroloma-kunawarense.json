    "intro": "Neuroloma kunawarense, commonly known as the Kunawarre neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
