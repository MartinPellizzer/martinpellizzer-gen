It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a mint-like fragrance, which contributes to its common name.
