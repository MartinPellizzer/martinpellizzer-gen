It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy, pale yellow coloration. The flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive purple-veined pattern on the petals, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. This cultivar is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
