    "intro": "Neorautanenia amboensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Neorautanenia amboensis plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
