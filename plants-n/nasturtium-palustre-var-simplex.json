    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. simplex, commonly known as marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
