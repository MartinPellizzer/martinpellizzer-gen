    "intro": "Nageia salicifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf nageia, is a species of conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its flat, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Nageia salicifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
