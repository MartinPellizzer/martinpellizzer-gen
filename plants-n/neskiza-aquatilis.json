    "intro": "Neskiza aquatilis, commonly known as the water wisp, is a delicate aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow waters, where it forms dense, floating mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight efficiently. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often blooming in early summer. Neskiza aquatilis plays a vital role in maintaining water clarity and supporting biodiversity in its environment."
