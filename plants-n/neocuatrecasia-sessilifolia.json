    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf neocuatrecasia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
