    "intro": "Nolana triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and the flowers are often purple or blue in color. Nolana triquetra is known for its resilience to drought and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
