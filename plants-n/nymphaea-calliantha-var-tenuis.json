    "intro": "Nymphaea calliantha var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a water lily native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The flowers are typically pink to lavender in color, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, preferring muddy or sandy bottoms. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
