    "intro": "Neotorularia grubovii, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and wetlands, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with flowering typically occurring in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
