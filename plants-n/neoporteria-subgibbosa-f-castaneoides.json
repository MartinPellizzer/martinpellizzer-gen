It is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that are typically borne on upright stems. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. Due to its hybrid origin, it may exhibit variability in growth habits and leaf patterns."
