It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
