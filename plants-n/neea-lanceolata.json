    "intro": "Neea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf neea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in the spring. Neea lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
