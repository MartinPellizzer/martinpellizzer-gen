    "intro": "Notholaena lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
