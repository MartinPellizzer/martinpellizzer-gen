    "intro": "Narcissus neglectus subsp. bicchianus, commonly known as the Sicilian daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the narcissus genus native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers with a single trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in Mediterranean climates. It blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow petals that contrast with its pale green foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
