    "intro": "Nama parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nama, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Nama parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its drought tolerance."
