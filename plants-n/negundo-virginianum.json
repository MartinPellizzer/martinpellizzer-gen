    "intro": "Negundo virginianum, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in patches to reveal a smooth, lighter-colored inner layer. The tree has opposite, simple, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and grouped in catkins, while its fruit is a spherical, three-winged samara. Negundo virginianum is often found along rivers and streams, where its extensive root system helps prevent erosion."
