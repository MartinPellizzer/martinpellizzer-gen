    "intro": "Nymphaea ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a yellow center, and bloom during the day. Nymphaea ovata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
