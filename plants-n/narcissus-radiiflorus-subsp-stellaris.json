    "intro": "Narcissus radiiflorus subsp. stellaris, commonly known as the starry daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like floral structure with reflexed petals and a prominent yellow corona. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
