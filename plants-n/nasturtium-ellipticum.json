It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant orange or yellow flowers. The plant is herbaceous, growing as an annual or biennial, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its flowers are edible, often used in salads or as a garnish, and the leaves have a peppery taste similar to watercress. Nasturtium ellipticum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
