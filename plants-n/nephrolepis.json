    "intro": "Nephrolepis, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The plant features dichotomous branching, where the fronds split into two equal parts, creating a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery look. Nephrolepis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
