    "intro": "Nardurus tenellus var. trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's nardus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
