    "intro": "Nephrolepis obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically broad and have a soft, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
