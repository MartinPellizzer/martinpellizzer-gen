    "intro": "Notholaena meridionalis, commonly known as the southern rock fern, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Notholaena meridionalis typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in limestone regions and is adapted to dry, well-drained conditions."
