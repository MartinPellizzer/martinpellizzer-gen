It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a prominent central pistil and numerous stamens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes or ponds. Its roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland habitats."
