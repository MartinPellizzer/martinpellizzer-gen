    "intro": "Neopectinaria, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The plants typically have a short, underground rhizome and produce a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Neopectinaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
