    "intro": "Nervilia flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, feathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Nervilia flabelliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
