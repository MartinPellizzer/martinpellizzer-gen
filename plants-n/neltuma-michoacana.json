    "intro": "Neltuma michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan mushroom, is a species of fungi native to the central highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive cap, which ranges from white to pale yellow in color. The gills are typically pale yellow and become darker with age, while the stem is slender and often covered in fine, silky hairs. This mushroom is often found growing in association with oak and pine trees in forested areas. Its fruiting bodies are usually small, measuring up to 5 centimeters in diameter, and it is primarily a mycorrhizal species, forming symbiotic relationships with tree roots."
