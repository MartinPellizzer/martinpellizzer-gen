    "intro": "Notylia tenuis, commonly known as the slender notylia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Notylia tenuis typically grows in dense colonies, often forming a carpet-like ground cover. It plays an important ecological role in its native wetland environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
