    "intro": "Notodanthonia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western sandplain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Western Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in arid environments. This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
