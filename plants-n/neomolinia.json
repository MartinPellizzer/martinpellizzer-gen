It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plants typically have narrow, bluish-green leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Neomolinia species are often found in prairie ecosystems and are important components of native grasslands. They are also valued for their role in erosion control and wildlife habitat."
