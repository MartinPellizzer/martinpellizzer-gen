    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. advena, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has large, floating leaves that are usually yellowish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange or red berries. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetland habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
