    "intro": "Nymphaea discolor, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and even red, depending on the environmental conditions. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically round and float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
