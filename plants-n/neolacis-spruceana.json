    "intro": "Neolacis spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's neolacis, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Neolacis spruceana is considered a rare and specialized plant."
