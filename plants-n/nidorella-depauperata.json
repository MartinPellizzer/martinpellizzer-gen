    "intro": "Nidorella depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Nidorella depauperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
