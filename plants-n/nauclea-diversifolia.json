    "intro": "Nauclea diversifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Nauclea diversifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and has some traditional medicinal uses."
