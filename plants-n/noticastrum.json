    "intro": "Noticastrum, commonly known as the gum tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Noticastrum species are characterized by their woody stems, compound leaves, and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They are also known for producing a type of natural gum, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological importance in their native habitats."
