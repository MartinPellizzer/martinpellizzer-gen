    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. muticus, commonly known as the mute daffodil, is a subspecies of the common daffodil characterized by its distinctive, elongated petals and reduced, often inconspicuous corona. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 20 to 40 centimeters and blooms in early spring with bright yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its hardiness and resilience in Mediterranean climates. The subspecies is noted for its subtle appearance compared to other daffodil varieties, hence its common name."
