    "intro": "Narcissus majalis var. plenus, commonly known as the double-flowers daffodil, is a variety of the Crown Imperial daffodil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that have a double petal structure, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical daffodils. The plant produces multiple flower heads per stem, each with a central crown of petals surrounded by a ring of smaller petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in early spring. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to naturalize over time."
