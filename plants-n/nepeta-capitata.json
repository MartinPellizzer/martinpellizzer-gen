    "intro": "Nepeta capitata, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces aromatic essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as an upright herbaceous perennial. Nepeta capitata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
