    "intro": "Nilgirianthus barbatus, commonly known as the Nilgiri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. Nilgirianthus barbatus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
