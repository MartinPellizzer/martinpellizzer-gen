    "intro": "Nepeta tenuicaulis, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a mint-like scent, which is particularly strong when crushed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a natural remedy for repelling cats due to its strong fragrance. Nepeta tenuicaulis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
