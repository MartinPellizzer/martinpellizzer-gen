    "intro": "Nodocarpaea radicans, commonly known as the creeping nodocarp, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Nodocarpaea radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover in woodland gardens."
