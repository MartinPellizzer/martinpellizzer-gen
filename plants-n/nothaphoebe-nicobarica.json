    "intro": "Nothaphoebe nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar beech, is a deciduous tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
