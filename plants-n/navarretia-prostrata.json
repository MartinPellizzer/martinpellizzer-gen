    "intro": "Navarretia prostrata, commonly known as the coastal dwarf morning glory, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western coast of North America. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with thin, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores. Navarretia prostrata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides nectar for early pollinators."
