    "intro": "Neowashingtonia filifera, commonly known as the coastal Washingtonia palm, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Neowashingtonia filifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience in dry climates."
