    "intro": "Namation glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular namation, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The glandular structures on its leaves are a key botanical feature that distinguishes it from related species."
