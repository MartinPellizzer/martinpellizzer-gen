    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis var. muenscheri, commonly known as the Mexican watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
