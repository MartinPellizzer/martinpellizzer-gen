    "intro": "Nidorella zavattarii, commonly known as the Zavattari's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidorella zavattarii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
