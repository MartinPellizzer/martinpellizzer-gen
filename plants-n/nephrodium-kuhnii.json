    "intro": "Nephrodium kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Nephrodium kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
