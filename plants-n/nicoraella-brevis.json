    "intro": "Nicoraella brevis, commonly known as the short-banded bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, branching stems covered in small, green leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Nicoraella brevis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
