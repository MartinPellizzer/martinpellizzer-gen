    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa f. subcylindrica, commonly known as the narrow-cylindrical neoporteria, is a rare and distinctive member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical collections."
