    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia var. compacta, commonly known as the compact maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in indoor gardening."
