    "intro": "Neoschischkinia truncatula subsp. durieui, commonly known as the Durie's mountain lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
