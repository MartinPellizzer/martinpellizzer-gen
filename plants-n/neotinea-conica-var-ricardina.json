    "intro": "Neotinea conica var. ricardina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The variety ricardina is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Neotinea conica."
