    "intro": "Neocheiropteris sapaensis, commonly known as the Sapa water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This fern plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
