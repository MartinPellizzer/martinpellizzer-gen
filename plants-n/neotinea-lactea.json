    "intro": "Neotinea lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. The plant is native to regions in South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are hairy and have a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Neotinea lactea is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
