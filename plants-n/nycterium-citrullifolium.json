    "intro": "Nycterium citrullifolium, commonly known as the citrullifolium nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that resemble the leaves of the cucumber plant, hence its specific epithet. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
