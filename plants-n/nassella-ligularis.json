    "intro": "Nassella ligularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Nassella ligularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
