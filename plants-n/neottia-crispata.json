    "intro": "Neottia crispata, commonly known as the wrinkled helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant is epipogium-like in appearance, lacking true roots and relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia crispata is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
