    "intro": "Nicotiana alpina var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert tobacco, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking violet to blue flowers, often with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in low-resource conditions."
