    "intro": "Neomarica occidentalis, commonly known as the western mariana, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces numerous pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value. Neomarica occidentalis is often cultivated for its striking floral display and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
