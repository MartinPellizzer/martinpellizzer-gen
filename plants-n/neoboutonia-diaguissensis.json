    "intro": "Neoboutonia diaguissensis, commonly known as the Diagu\u00eds fern, is a rare and unique species native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems and its potential value in botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
