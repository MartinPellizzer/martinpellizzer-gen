    "intro": "Nematanthus longipes f. laticalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed flame flower, is a unique hybrid of the genus Nematanthus native to South America. This plant is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling flames, hence its common name. The foliage is broad and glossy, with leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas."
