    "intro": "Nigritella rubra var. dolomitensis, commonly known as the Dolomitic Red Nigritella, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone-rich regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking red petals and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
