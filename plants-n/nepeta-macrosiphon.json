It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effect on cats.
