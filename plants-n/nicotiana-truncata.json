It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its hairy, truncate-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in ecological studies due to its role as a host plant for various insects. Its genetic makeup has also made it a valuable model organism in plant biology research."
