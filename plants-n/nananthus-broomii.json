    "intro": "Nananthus broomii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Nananthus broomii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
