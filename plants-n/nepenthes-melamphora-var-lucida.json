    "intro": "Nepenthes melamphora var. lucida, commonly known as the bright-shielded pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped traps that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant's leaves are long and spiral around the stem, forming a dense canopy that helps support its heavy pitchers. The nectar-producing rim of the pitcher attracts insects, which are then digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. This species is notable for its unique morphology and adaptability to humid, shaded environments."
