    "intro": "Nervilia scottii, commonly known as the Scottish fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the upper portion of the plant. Nervilia scottii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
