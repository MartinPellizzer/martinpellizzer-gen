    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. barbareifolium, commonly known as the marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the Tropaeolaceae family. Its stems are slender and often sprawling, adapted to grow in moist or aquatic environments. The leaves and flowers are edible, with a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a useful plant in culinary and medicinal applications."
