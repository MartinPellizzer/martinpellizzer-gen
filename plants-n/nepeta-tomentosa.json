It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other mint relatives such as lavender and sage. Nepeta tomentosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
