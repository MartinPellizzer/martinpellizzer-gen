    "intro": "Notholaena hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's notholaena, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many ferns and their allies. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Notholaena hookeri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
