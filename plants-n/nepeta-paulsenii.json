    "intro": "Nepeta paulsenii, commonly known as Paulsen's catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often fragrant and resembles that of other catnip species, though it is less commonly used as a cat attractant. Nepeta paulsenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in various climates."
