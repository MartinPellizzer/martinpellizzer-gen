    "intro": "Nama multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered nama, is a hardy shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Nama multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
