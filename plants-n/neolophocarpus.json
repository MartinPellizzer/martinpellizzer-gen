    "intro": "Neolophocarpus, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that often have a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. Neolophocarpus species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, rather than in soil. Their spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The genus includes several species, many of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world."
