    "intro": "Nesogordonia monantha, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
