    "intro": "Niphidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved niphidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and often grows in moist, shaded environments. Niphidium longifolium is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
