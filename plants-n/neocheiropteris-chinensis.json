It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Neocheiropteris chinensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
