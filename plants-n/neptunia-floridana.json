    "intro": "Neptunia floridana, commonly known as the Florida marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in freshwater marshes. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Neptunia floridana is also noted for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important species in wetland restoration projects."
