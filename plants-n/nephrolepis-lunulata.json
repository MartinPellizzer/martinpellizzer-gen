    "intro": "Nephrolepis lunulata, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it a luminous appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
