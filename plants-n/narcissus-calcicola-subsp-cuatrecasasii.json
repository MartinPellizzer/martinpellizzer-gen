    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas narcissus, is a rare and specialized plant native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its narrow distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
