It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Nenax acerosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
