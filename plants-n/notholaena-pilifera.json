    "intro": "Notholaena pilifera, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often creeping and can form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the first year's growth being sterile and the second year producing spores on the underside."
