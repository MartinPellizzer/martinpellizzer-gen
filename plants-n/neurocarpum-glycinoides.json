    "intro": "Neurocarpum glycinoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces indehiscent fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Neurocarpum glycinoides is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions."
