    "intro": "Nanostelma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, translucent leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts."
