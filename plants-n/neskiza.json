It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Neskiza is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
