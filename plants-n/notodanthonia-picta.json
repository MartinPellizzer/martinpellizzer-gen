    "intro": "Notodanthonia picta, commonly known as the painted sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Notodanthonia picta is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
