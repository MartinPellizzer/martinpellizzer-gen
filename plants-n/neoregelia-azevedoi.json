    "intro": "Neoregelia azevedoi, commonly known as the Azevedo's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green markings, adding to its ornamental value. Neoregelia azevedoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
