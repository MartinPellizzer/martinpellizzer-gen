    "intro": "Neanotis oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This plant is often found in fynbos vegetation and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
