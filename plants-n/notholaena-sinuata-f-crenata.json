    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata f. crenata, commonly known as the serrated notholaena, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, crenate (serrated) margins that give it its distinguishing appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its fine, lace-like foliage."
