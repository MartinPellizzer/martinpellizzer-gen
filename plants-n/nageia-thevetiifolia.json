    "intro": "Nageia thevetiifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. Due to its specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
