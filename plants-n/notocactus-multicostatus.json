    "intro": "Notocactus multicostatus, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, ridged, and segmented stems that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form with multiple stems branching out from the base. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
