    "intro": "Neocheiropteris venosa, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving water and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a distinct venation pattern that gives it its common name. Neocheiropteris venosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
