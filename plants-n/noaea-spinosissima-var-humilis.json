    "intro": "Noaea spinosissima var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf spiny fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiny bracts and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
