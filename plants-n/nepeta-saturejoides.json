    "intro": "Nepeta saturejoides, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. Nepeta saturejoides is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
