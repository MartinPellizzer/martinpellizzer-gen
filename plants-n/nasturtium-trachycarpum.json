It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of orange, yellow, and red, often with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has heart-shaped, edible leaves and produces seed pods that are also edible, though they have a peppery taste. Native to South America, it thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated as a decorative and culinary plant. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for gardens and containers."
