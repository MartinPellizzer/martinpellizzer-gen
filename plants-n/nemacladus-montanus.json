It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while its flowers are usually pink or white with four petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
