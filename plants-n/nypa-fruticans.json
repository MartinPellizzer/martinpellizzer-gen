    "intro": "Nypa fruticans, commonly known as the mangrove palm, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a halophyte, meaning it can thrive in saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a tall, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody fruits that contain a single seed. Nypa fruticans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
