It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often feature a combination of colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from thin soil layers, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
