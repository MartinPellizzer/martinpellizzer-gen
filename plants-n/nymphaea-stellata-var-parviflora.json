    "intro": "Nymphaea stellata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers open in the early morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
