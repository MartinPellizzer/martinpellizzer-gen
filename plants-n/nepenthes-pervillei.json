    "intro": "Nepenthes pervillei, commonly known as the Perville's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitcher-shaped structures filled with digestive fluid. These pitchers are typically green or red in color and serve as traps for insects, which provide nutrients to the plant. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. Its striking appearance and specialized adaptations make it a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
