    "intro": "Najas marina var. muricata, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems if not managed properly."
