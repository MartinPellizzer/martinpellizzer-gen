It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive white throat. The plant produces clusters of narrow, strap-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late summer to early autumn."
