    "intro": "Notholaena, commonly known as the false buttonbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species that are native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland and swampy habitats. The plants are characterized by their showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble small, round buttons, hence the common name. They have simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, adding to their ornamental value. Notholaena species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some species growing up to several feet in height."
