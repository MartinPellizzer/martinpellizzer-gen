    "intro": "Nilgirianthus perrottetianus, commonly known as the Nilgiri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
