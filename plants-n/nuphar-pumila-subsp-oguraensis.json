    "intro": "Nuphar pumila subsp. oguraensis, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and floral morphology compared to other Nuphar species."
