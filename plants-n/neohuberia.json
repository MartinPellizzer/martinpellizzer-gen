It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and sometimes orange. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Neohuberia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
