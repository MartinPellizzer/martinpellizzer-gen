    "intro": "Nymphoides senegalensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphoides senegalensis plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
