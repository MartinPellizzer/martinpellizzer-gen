    "intro": "Norantea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Norantea obovata is often found in forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat."
