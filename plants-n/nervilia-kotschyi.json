    "intro": "Nervilia kotschyi, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia kotschyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
