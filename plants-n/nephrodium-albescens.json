    "intro": "Nephrodium albescens, commonly known as the white kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests in Southeast Asia. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Nephrodium albescens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
