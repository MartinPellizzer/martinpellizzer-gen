    "intro": "Nephrodium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous nephroid, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like structures that resemble small fruits or seeds. The plant produces numerous small, rounded tubers along its stems, which are often mistaken for true bulbs. These tubers serve as storage organs and can give rise to new growth under suitable conditions. Nephrodium bulbiferum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in rich, organic soil."
