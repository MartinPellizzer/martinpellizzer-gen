    "intro": "Neomammillaria melanocentra, commonly known as the black-centred nipple cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem and typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. Its most distinctive feature is the dark, almost black, areoles that are covered with white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its dark features. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its compact size and unique appearance."
