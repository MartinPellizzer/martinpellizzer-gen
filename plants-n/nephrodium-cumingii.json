    "intro": "Nephrodium cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's nephroid, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are leathery and have a unique arrangement of veins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium cumingii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
