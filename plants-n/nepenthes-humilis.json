    "intro": "Nepenthes humilis, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces a distinctive, sweet-smelling nectar to lure prey into its digestive chamber. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
