    "intro": "Nectandra membranacea subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandstone tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive aromatic scent, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
