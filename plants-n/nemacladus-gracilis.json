    "intro": "Nemacladus gracilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Nemacladus gracilis is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family."
