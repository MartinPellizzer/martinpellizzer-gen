    "intro": "Nyctanthes tristis, commonly known as night-flowering jasmine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow before falling in winter. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet scent. These flowers are clustered in panicles and are often used in traditional medicine for their therapeutic properties. Nyctanthes tristis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
