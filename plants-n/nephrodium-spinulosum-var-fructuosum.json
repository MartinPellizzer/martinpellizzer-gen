    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum var. fructuosum, commonly known as the fructuous kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a serrated or spinose margin that gives it its common name. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a textured surface that aids in water retention. This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils."
