    "intro": "Noticastrum hatschbachii, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
