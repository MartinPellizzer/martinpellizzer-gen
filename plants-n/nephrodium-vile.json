    "intro": "Nephrodium vile, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments. It possesses small, leaf-like structures called bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant's flowers are typically small and green, with a distinctive, unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and waterlogged conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
