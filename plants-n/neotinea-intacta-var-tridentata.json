    "intro": "Neotinea intacta var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique, linear pattern. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
