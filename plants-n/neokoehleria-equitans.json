    "intro": "Neokoehleria equitans, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale to dark purple flowers. Neokoehleria equitans thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
