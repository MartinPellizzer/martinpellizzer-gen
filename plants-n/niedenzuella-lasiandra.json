    "intro": "Niedenzuella lasiandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. Niedenzuella lasiandra is often found in wetland areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
