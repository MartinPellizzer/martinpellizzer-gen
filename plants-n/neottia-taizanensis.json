    "intro": "Neottia taizanensis, commonly known as the Taizan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neottia taizanensis is considered a critically endangered species."
