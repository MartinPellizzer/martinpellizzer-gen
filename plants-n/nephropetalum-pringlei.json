    "intro": "Nephropetalum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short flowering period and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Nephropetalum pringlei is considered endangered."
