    "intro": "[WRONG START] Nepenthes \u00d7 wrigheyana, commonly known as the Wrigley's pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 300 milliliters of liquid. The plant is native to the Borneo region and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its pitchers are typically red or orange with a waxy coating, which helps in attracting prey. This species is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
