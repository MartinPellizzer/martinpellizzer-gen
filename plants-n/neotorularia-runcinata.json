    "intro": "Neotorularia runcinata, commonly known as the slender spore moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, erect stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cuticle. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores into the air. Neotorularia runcinata is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of microhabitats in moist, shaded ecosystems."
