It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white to yellowish tubercles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
