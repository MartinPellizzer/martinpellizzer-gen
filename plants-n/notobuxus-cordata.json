    "intro": "Notobuxus cordata, commonly known as the broadleaf snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Notobuxus cordata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and natural landscapes."
