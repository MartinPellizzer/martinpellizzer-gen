    "intro": "Nama dichotoma var. dichotoma, commonly known as the Namakwa or Namakwa grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Nama dichotoma var. dichotoma is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of local vegetation in its native range."
