    "intro": "Nymphoides flava, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Nymphoides flava thrives in still or slow-moving waters with ample sunlight and is relatively easy to cultivate in aquatic gardens."
