    "intro": "Nepenthes rowanae, commonly known as the Bornean giant insectivorous plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and break down prey. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, slippery surface on the pitcher's rim, which prevents prey from escaping. Nepenthes rowanae thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on rainfall for the growth of its specialized structures. Its ecological role includes nutrient recycling in nutrient-poor soils and serving as a habitat for various microorganisms."
