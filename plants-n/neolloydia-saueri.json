    "intro": "Neolloydia saueri, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neolloydia saueri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
