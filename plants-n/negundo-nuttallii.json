    "intro": "Negundo nuttallii, commonly known as the boxelder maple, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes other maples, and is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The boxelder maple is often found in moist soils near rivers and streams, and it plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
