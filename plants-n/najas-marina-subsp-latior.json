    "intro": "Najas marina subsp. latior, commonly known as broadleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
