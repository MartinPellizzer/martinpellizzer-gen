    "intro": "Nephrodium heterocarpon, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Nephrodium heterocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
