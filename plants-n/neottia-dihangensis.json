    "intro": "Neottia dihangensis, commonly known as the Dihang ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster and bloom during the late winter or early spring. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Neottia dihangensis is considered a critically endangered species."
