    "intro": "Neuropeltis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
