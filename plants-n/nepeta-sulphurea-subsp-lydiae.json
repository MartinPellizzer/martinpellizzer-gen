    "intro": "Nepeta sulphurea subsp. lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's catnip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage emits a strong mint-like scent, which is believed to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
