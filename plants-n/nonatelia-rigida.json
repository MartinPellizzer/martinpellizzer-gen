It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has rough, fibrous leaves that are adapted to withstand arid conditions. Nonatelia rigida is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
