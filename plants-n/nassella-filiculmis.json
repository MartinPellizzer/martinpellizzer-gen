    "intro": "Nassella filiculmis, commonly known as the feather-leaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that resemble the shape of fern fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Nassella filiculmis is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environments."
