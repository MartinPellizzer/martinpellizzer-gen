    "intro": "Naucleopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered nauclea, is a small, woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
