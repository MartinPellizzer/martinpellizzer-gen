    "intro": "Neopaulia alpina, commonly known as the alpine neopaulia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Neopaulia alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming a dense carpet that helps prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
