    "intro": "Nephrolepis muscosa, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrolepis muscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings."
