    "intro": "Narcissus assoanus subsp. magnicoronatus, commonly known as the giant crown narcissus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a prominent, often bulbous corona that can reach up to 5 centimeters in height. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine regions of southern Europe. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
