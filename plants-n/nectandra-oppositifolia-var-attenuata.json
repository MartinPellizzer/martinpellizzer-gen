    "intro": "Nectandra oppositifolia var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandarac tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. The tree's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
