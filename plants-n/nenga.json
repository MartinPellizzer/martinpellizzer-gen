    "intro": "Nenga, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety foliage and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and produces flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. Nenga thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom throughout the year makes it a favored houseplant for indoor gardening."
