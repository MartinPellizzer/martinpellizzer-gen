    "intro": "Nicolletia, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its unique, feathery seed heads that resemble smoke. The plants typically grow in prairie and open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Nicolletia species are perennial herbs that produce small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers in early spring. Their ornamental value comes from their distinctive, plume-like appearance, which persists into late summer."
