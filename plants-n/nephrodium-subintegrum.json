    "intro": "Nephrodium subintegrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the leaf margins, which are typically borne on specialized structures called indusia. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
