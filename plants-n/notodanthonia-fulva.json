    "intro": "Notodanthonia fulva, commonly known as the yellow wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Notodanthonia fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
