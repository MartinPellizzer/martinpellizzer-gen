    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. brevicoronatus, commonly known as the narrow-crowned daffodil, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201325 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower. The flower consists of a short, narrow corona surrounded by six tepals that are usually pale yellow to white in color. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is prized for its compact size and subtle floral display, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces."
