    "intro": "Nimbo, commonly known as the rain tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, umbrella-shaped canopy and striking, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Nimbo is well adapted to humid climates and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and reforestation projects."
