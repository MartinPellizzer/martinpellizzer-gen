    "intro": "Neolitsea villosa, commonly known as the hairy flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Neolitsea villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
