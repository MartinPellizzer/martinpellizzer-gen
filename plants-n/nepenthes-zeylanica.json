    "intro": "Nepenthes zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Nepenthes zeylanica is a carnivorous plant that captures and digests insects to supplement its nutrient intake."
