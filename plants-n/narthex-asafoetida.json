    "intro": "Narthex asafoetida, commonly known as hing, is a perennial herb native to the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous scent. The plant produces a yellowish to reddish resin from its rhizomes, which is harvested and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The resin contains a complex mixture of volatile oils, including elemicin and ferulic acid, contributing to its distinctive odor. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for digestive and anti-inflammatory purposes."
