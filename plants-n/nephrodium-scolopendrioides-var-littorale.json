    "intro": "Nephrodium scolopendrioides var. littorale, commonly known as the coastal nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. Its reproductive structures are small, clustered inflorescences that produce minute, greenish flowers. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature."
