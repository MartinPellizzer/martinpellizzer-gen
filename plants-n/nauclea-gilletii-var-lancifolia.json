It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It has a shallow root system, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties."
