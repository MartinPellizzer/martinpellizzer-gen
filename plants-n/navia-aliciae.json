    "intro": "Navia aliciae, commonly known as the fairy's lace plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble woven silk, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Navia aliciae thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
