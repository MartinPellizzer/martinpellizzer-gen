    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. tananicus, commonly known as the Tananian daffodil, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tanan in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many daffodil species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
