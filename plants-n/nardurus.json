    "intro": "Nardurus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Nardurus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
