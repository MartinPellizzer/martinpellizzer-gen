    "intro": "Notocactus ottonis var. globularis, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a compact, globular-shaped cactus native to Mexico. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is typically green with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem for drought resistance. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
