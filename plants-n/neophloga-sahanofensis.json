    "intro": "Neophloga sahanofensis, commonly known as the Sahanofen ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, ghost-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanical research."
