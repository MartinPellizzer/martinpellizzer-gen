    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 cothurnalis, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its enlarged, petal-like tepals that form a distinctive double crown, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical daffodils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. This hybrid is valued for its vibrant yellow color and extended blooming period in early spring."
