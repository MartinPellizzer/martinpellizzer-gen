    "intro": "Noronhia linocerioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators, while its fruits are small drupes containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, Noronhia linocerioides is now considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
