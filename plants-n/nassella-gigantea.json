    "intro": "Nassella gigantea, commonly known as giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Nassella gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
