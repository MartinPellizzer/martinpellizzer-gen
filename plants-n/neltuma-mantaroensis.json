    "intro": "Neltuma mantaroensis, commonly known as the Mantaro fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized spore cases, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma mantaroensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
