    "intro": "Nephrodium catopteron var. minus, commonly known as the lesser mirror fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. The fronds are usually a dark green with a slightly glossy texture. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Nephrodium catopteron."
