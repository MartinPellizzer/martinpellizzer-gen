    "intro": "Neogriseocereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Neogriseocereus fricii is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water."
