    "intro": "Narcissus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, cup-shaped flower with bright yellow petals and a central throat that is often a different color, such as white or orange. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners looking to add color to smaller spaces."
