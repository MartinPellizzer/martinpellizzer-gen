    "intro": "Natalanthe floribunda, commonly known as the showy natalanthe, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Natalanthe floribunda is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
