    "intro": "Nanorrhinum bentii, commonly known as the bentii sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Nanorrhinum bentii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
