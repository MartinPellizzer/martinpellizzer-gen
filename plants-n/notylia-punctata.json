    "intro": "Notylia punctata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Notylia punctata plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
