    "intro": "Nephelium capense, commonly known as the African persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, orange-colored fruits with a sweet, honey-like flavor. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its culinary uses. Nephelium capense thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
