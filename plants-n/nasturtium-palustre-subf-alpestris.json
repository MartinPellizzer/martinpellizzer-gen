    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre subf. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, edible leaves that have a peppery taste. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative and edible plant in gardens."
