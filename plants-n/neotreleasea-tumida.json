    "intro": "Neotreleasea tumida, commonly known as the swollen bladder fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, bladder-like sporangia that are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study. The sporangia are not only visually striking but also play a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle."
