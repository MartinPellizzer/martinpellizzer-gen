It features large, showy flowers with prominent, spiky bracts that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed edges, and its flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neuracanthus polyacanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
