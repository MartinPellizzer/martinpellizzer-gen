    "intro": "Nicotiana rupicola, commonly known as the rock tobacco plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Botanically, it is notable for its nicotine content and its role in the broader Nicotiana genus, which includes economically important tobacco species."
