    "intro": "Nothoscordum demissum, commonly known as the lesser false garlic, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures called corms, which are often mistaken for true bulbs due to their similar appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Nothoscordum demissum is typically found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers."
