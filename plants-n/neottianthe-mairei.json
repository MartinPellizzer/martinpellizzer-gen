    "intro": "Neottianthe mairei, commonly known as the Maire's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and dark green, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neottianthe mairei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
