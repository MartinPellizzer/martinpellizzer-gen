    "intro": "Neotinea \u00d7 dietrichiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Neotinea species, typically resulting from the hybridization of Neotinea cruciata and Neotinea sanguinea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in orchids and its ornamental value in horticulture."
