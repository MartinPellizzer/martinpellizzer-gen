It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Notholaena dealbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
