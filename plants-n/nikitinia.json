    "intro": "Nikitinia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. Nikitinia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. They produce showy, often yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species of Nikitinia are considered invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to their rapid growth and adaptability."
