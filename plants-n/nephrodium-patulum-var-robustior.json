    "intro": "Nephrodium patulum var. robustior, commonly known as the robust nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its robust growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. It features broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib, which contribute to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered spores in specialized structures called sporangia, typical of ferns. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid forests. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
