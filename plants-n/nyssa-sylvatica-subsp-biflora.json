It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
