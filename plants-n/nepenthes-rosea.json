    "intro": "Nepenthes rosea, commonly known as the pink pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its striking pink to red-colored pitchers, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, narrow stem and a basal rosette of waxy, spoon-shaped leaves. Nepenthes rosea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth. Its ornamental value has made it a popular species in horticulture, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
