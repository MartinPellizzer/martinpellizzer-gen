    "intro": "Nephrodium nigrescens, commonly known as the black kidney fern, is a rare and intriguing member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
