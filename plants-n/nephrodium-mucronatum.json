    "intro": "Nephrodium mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The leaves are simple, with a serrated margin and a narrow, lance-shaped appearance."
