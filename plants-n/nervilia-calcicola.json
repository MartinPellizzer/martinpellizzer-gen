    "intro": "Nervilia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a perennial plant native to calcareous soils in eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. Its rhizome system helps it anchor firmly in the soil, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules on the underside of its leaves. Nervilia calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to limestone substrates."
