It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
