    "intro": "Nephrodium securidiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium securidiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscaping."
