    "intro": "Nephrodium layardii, commonly known as the Layard's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Nephrodium layardii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
