    "intro": "Nervilia punctata, commonly known as the spotted nerveplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features delicate, grass-like foliage with a distinctive blue-green hue and produces small, pale pink to white flowers in late spring. The plant's leaves are often marked with dark purple or brown spots, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Nervilia punctata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
