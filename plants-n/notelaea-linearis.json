    "intro": "Notelaea linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Australia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant features a short, trunk-like stem with a crown of long, narrow, dark green leaves. Its cones are distinctive, with male cones producing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Notelaea linearis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to drought and heat."
