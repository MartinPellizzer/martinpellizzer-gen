    "intro": "Neogaya simplex, commonly known as the simple neogaya, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity. Its botanical features include simple, ovate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neogaya simplex is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
