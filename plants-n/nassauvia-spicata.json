    "intro": "Nassauvia spicata, commonly known as the redstem nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often reddish in color, which contributes to its common name. Nassauvia spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
