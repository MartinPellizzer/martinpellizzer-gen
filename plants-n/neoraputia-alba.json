    "intro": "Neoraputia alba, commonly known as the white raputia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking white flowers and rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Neoraputia alba thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
