    "intro": "Nicotiana floribunda, commonly known as the tropical tobacco plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often arranged in clusters. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which can release a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves contain nicotine, though the concentration is lower than in other Nicotiana species."
