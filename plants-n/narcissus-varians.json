    "intro": "Narcissus varians, commonly known as the variable daffodil, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to white, with a distinct perianth division. Its bulbs are perennial, and it blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display."
