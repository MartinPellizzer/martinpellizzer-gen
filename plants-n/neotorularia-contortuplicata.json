    "intro": "Neotorularia contortuplicata, commonly known as the twisted liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of fine hairs. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and play a key role in its life cycle. Neotorularia contortuplicata is notable for its ability to tolerate desiccation, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
