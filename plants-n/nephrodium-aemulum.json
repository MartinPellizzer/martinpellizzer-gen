    "intro": "Nephrodium aemulum, commonly known as the small nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically a deep green color. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
