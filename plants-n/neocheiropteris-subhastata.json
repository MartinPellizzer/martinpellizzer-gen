    "intro": "Neocheiropteris subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinct, narrow base that tapers toward the tip. This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
