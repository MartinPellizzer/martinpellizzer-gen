    "intro": "Nephelea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fern, is a rare vascular plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native range."
