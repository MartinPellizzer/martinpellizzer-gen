    "intro": "Najas marina subsp. aculeolata, commonly known as the spiked water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its presence can indicate good water quality, as it is sensitive to pollution."
