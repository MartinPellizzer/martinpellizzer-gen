    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. eualbidus, commonly known as the white-flowered narcissus, is a rare variant of the narcissus genus native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically blooms in early spring and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
