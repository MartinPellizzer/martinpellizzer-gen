    "intro": "Nepeta amethystina var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, fuzzy foliage that ranges from gray-green to silver-white. The plant produces clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for gardens. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular selection for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
