    "intro": "Nania operculata, commonly known as the operculum lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, laminar layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, rounded or operculate apothecium. It thrives in temperate and subtropical regions, often found on calcareous substrates. This lichen is known for its chemical composition, including the presence of usnic acid, which contributes to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
