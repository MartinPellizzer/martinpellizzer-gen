    "intro": "Neoregelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
