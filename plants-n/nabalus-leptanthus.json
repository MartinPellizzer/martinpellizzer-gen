    "intro": "Nabalus leptanthus, commonly known as the slender thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Nabalus leptanthus is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
