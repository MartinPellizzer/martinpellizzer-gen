    "intro": "Nasturtium nudiusculum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a popular herb in salads and garnishes. The species is often grown in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
