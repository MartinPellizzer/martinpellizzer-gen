    "intro": "Notelaea excelsa, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a large monocot native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Notelaea excelsa is often found in coastal or wetland areas, where it thrives in humid, saline environments."
