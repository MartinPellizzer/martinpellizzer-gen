    "intro": "Neurogramma pedata, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive morphology. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizome that is often covered in a dense mat of small, scale-like structures. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that are often curved and overlapping. Neurogramma pedata is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems."
