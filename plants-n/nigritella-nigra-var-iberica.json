    "intro": "Nigritella nigra var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
