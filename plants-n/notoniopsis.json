    "intro": "Notoniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils and its striking, showy flowers that often appear in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Notoniopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
