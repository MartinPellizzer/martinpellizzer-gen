    "intro": "Neolitsea melchioriana, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Neolitsea melchioriana thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm regions."
