    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils. It is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions with limestone substrates. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
