    "intro": "Nidularium innocentii var. lineatum, commonly known as the zigzag spiderwort, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, zigzagging leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. The varietal form 'lineatum' is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf patterns compared to the typical species."
