    "intro": "Nasonia myrtillus, commonly known as the European parasitic wasp, is a small, black wasp with a distinctive metallic sheen. It is a parasitoid insect that lays its eggs inside the bodies of other insects, primarily flies, as part of its life cycle. The plant-related aspect of Nasonia myrtillus is its association with specific host plants, such as those in the genus *Drosophila*, which serve as the primary food source for its larvae. The wasp's life cycle is closely tied to the availability of these host plants, making them ecologically significant in certain environments. Due to its role in natural pest control, Nasonia myrtillus is also studied in biological research and conservation efforts."
