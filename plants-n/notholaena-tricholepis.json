    "intro": "Notholaena tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. Notholaena tricholepis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
