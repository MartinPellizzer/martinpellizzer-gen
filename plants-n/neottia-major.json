    "intro": "Neottia major, commonly known as the greater twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungi for nutrients, making it an interesting example of symbiotic relationships in plant ecology. Neottia major typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heaths. Its unique biological traits make it a subject of study in both botany and mycology."
