    "intro": "Nothopegia sivagiriana, commonly known as the Sivagiri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to its limited distribution and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
