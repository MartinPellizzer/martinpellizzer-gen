    "intro": "Nesogordonia ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri ivorywood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
