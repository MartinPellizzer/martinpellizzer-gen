    "intro": "Nephrodium extensum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its fronds are usually shorter and narrower compared to the typical variety, with a distinct, segmented structure. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
