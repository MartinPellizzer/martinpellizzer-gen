    "intro": "Nonatelia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered nonatelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
