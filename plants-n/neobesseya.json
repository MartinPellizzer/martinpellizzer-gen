    "intro": "Neobesseya, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Neobesseya species produce small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. The genus includes several species, with Neobesseya sericea being the most economically important due to its valuable timber."
