    "intro": "Nardus stricta var. glabriculmis, commonly known as the glabrous mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
