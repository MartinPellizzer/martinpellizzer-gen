It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are berry-like, containing multiple seeds. Nothopanax bastardianus is often found in humid, lowland forest environments, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
