    "intro": "Navarretia grandiflora, commonly known as the Sierra Lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on slender stems. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Navarretia grandiflora is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often flowering after rainfall in early spring. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
