    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis f. spinosior, commonly known as the Islay spiny neoporteria, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Isle of Islay in Scotland. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is notable for its dense, spiny bracts that give it a unique appearance and provide protection to its small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and damp grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
