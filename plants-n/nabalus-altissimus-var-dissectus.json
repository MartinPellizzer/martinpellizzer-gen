    "intro": "Nabalus altissimus var. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected mountain heath, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed and finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
