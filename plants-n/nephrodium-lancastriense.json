    "intro": "Nephrodium lancastriense, commonly known as the Lancashire water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the UK. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, consisting of sporangia that release spores into the water. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
