It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often near water sources. Its fruits are small, drupe-like structures that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
