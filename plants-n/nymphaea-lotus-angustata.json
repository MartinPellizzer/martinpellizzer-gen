    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers typically open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
