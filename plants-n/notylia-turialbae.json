    "intro": "Notylia turialbae, commonly known as the Turi\u00e1lba's notylia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notylia turialbae is considered a species of conservation concern."
