    "intro": "Neoboutonia glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous pineapple plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which can hold water. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that resemble pineapples, hence its common name. Neoboutonia glabrescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
