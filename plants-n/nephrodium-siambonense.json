    "intro": "Nephrodium siambonense, commonly known as the Siamese kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
