It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with small, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Noccaea tenuis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments."
