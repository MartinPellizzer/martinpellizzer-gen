    "intro": "Nitrophila mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave nitrophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant thrives in arid environments, particularly in sandy soils along washes and dry creek beds. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
