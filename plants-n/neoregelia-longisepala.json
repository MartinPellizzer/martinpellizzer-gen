    "intro": "Neoregelia longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepal bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can display a range of colors, including green, red, and purple. Neoregelia longisepala thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
