    "intro": "Neomarica candida, commonly known as the white spider lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble spider-like blooms, hence its common name. The plant is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is often cultivated for its elegant appearance and long-lasting blooms. Neomarica candida prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for both garden beds and container gardening. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates, adding visual interest throughout the year."
