    "intro": "Notocactus neoarechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with white to pale blue spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
