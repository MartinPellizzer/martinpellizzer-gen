    "intro": "Neottia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces two small, greenish-white flowers on a single stem, which are pollinated by insects. Neottia biflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
