    "intro": "Neottia diuretica, commonly known as the Diuretic Twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, grass-like stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Neottia diuretica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its name reflects traditional uses in herbal medicine, where it has been employed for its purported diuretic properties."
