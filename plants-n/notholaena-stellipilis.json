    "intro": "Notholaena stellipilis, commonly known as the star-pilose shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear small, star-shaped scales along the veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena stellipilis is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is notable for its unique morphological features."
