    "intro": "Nymphaea lukei, commonly known as the Luke's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the substrate."
