    "intro": "Neotinea maculata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the spotted orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the Neotinea maculata species. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical greenish or brownish hues of the standard form. This plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a raceme and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The plant has a slender, upright stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair."
