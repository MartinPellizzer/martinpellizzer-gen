    "intro": "Nevroctola, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and water. It is classified as a lithophyte, growing on tree trunks or branches in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, the ghost orchid is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
