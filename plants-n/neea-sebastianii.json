    "intro": "Neea sebastianii, commonly known as the Sebastian's neea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its botanical features include thin, leathery leaves and pale pink or white blooms that appear in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neea sebastianii is considered a species of conservation concern."
