    "intro": "Nephrodium leucorhachis, commonly known as the white-stemmed nephroid, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
