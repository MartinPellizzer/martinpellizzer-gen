    "intro": "Nepenthes merrilliana, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Nepenthes merrilliana is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and fascinating adaptations."
