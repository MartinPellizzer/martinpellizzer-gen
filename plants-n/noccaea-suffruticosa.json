    "intro": "Noccaea suffruticosa, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or stone mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed or divided, with small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spherical, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Noccaea suffruticosa is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
