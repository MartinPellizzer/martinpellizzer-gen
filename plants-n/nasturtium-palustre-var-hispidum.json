    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its \"hairy\" descriptor. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
