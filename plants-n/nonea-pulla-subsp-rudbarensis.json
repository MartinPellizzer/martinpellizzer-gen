The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is adapted to arid environments, showcasing features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
