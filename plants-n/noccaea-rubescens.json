    "intro": "Noccaea rubescens, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Noccaea rubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
