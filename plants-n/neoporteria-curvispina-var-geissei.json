    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina var. geissei, commonly known as the Geisse's climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its climbing habit and finely divided, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat. The varietal form, geissei, is distinguished by subtle differences in frond structure compared to the typical variety."
