    "intro": "Notholaena profusa, commonly known as the clustered spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight, club-like structures. The plant produces sporophytes with microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Notholaena profusa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
