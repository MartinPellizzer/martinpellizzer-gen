    "intro": "Nymphaea pubescens, commonly known as the woolly water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Nymphaea pubescens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
