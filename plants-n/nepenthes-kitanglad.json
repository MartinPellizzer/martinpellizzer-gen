    "intro": "Nepenthes kitanglad, commonly known as the Kitanglad pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the montane forests of the Kitanglad Range. Its pitchers can vary in color, often displaying shades of green, red, or yellow, depending on light exposure. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils."
