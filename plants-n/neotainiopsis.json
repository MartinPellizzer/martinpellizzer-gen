    "intro": "Neotainiopsis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in the Congo and Gabon. The plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences, which are composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Neotainiopsis species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are noted for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
