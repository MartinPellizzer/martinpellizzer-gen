    "intro": "Narcissus patulus subsp. vergellensis, commonly known as the Vergellian daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and single, showy flowers with a yellow perianth. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is a perennial species that produces its flowers in spring, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
