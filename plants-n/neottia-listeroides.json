    "intro": "Neottia listeroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Neottia listeroides is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
