    "intro": "Nauclea appendiculata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in various medicinal practices. The species is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
