    "intro": "Nardus articulata, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in sandy or salt-laden soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It is adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Nardus articulata plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion."
