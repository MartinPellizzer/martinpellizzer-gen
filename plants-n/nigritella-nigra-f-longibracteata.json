    "intro": "Nigritella nigra f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract nigritella, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that envelop the floral structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences from the standard Nigritella nigra."
