It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink. The plant is known for its unique, velvety texture on its foliage, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The tree's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warmer climates."
