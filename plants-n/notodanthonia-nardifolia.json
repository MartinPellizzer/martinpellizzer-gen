    "intro": "Notodanthonia nardifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
