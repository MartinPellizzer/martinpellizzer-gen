    "intro": "Nardurus lachenalii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandalwood, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant features a dense, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
