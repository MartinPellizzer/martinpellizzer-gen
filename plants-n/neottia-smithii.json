    "intro": "Neottia smithii, commonly known as the Smith\u2019s twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with two opposite leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Neottia smithii is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships."
