    "intro": "Nepenthes gymnamphora var. haematamphora, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcher plant, is a variant of the Nepenthes gymnamphora species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and pitcher structures that range from green to reddish in color. The plant produces nectar-filled traps that attract insects, which are then digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. This variant is noted for its unique coloration and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations."
