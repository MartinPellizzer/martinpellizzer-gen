    "intro": "Norantea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile norantea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its botanical classification places it within the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Norantea sessilis is considered an endangered species."
