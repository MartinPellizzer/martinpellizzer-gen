    "intro": "Nerophila clandestina, commonly known as the hidden bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Nerophila clandestina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
