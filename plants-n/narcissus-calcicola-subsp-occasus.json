    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. occasus, commonly known as the Occasus narcissus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to calcareous soils. It is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions with limestone-rich habitats. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, often fragrant scent. It is a bulbous perennial that thrives in well-drained, alkaline conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
