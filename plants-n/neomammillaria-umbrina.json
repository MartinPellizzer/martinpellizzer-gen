    "intro": "Neomammillaria umbrina, commonly known as the umbra nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Neomammillaria umbrina is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
