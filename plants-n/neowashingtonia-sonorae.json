    "intro": "Neowashingtonia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its robust, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Neowashingtonia sonorae is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater."
