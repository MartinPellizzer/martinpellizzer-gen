    "intro": "Notocactus schumannianus var. ampliocostatus, commonly known as the Schumann's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, rib-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
