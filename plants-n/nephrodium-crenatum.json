    "intro": "Nephrodium crenatum, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Nephrodium crenatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
