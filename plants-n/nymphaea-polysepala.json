    "intro": "Nymphaea polysepala, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that provide shade on the water surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom above the water. Nymphaea polysepala thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves and flowers float on the water's surface."
