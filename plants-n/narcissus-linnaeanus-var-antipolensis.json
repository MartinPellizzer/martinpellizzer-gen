It produces striking yellow flowers with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky habitats. Its bulbs are relatively small and require careful cultivation to prevent overgrowth. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in maritime environments."
