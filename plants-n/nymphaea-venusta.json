    "intro": "Nymphaea venusta, commonly known as the sacred water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking white or pink flowers bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in various regions."
