    "intro": "Nasturtium pubescens var. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the fringed nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers with a spurred petal at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its edible flowers and leaves, which have a peppery taste."
