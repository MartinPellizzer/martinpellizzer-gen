    "intro": "Narcissus linnaeanus subsp. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy, trumpet-shaped flower with a yellow corona. The flower is typically 5\u20138 cm in diameter, with a bright yellow perianth that lacks the typical green stripe found in many daffodil species. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, cheerful blooms."
