    "intro": "Nepeta circinnata, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Nepeta circinnata is also known for its mild mint-like fragrance and its historical use in herbal remedies."
