    "intro": "Noccaea montana subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky and barren soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against extreme cold. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and supports local pollinators."
