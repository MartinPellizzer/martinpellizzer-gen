    "intro": "Neuracanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered neuracanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
