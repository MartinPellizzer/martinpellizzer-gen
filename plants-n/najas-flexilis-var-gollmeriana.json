    "intro": "Najas flexilis var. gollmeriana, commonly known as the flexible watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting aquatic ecosystems."
