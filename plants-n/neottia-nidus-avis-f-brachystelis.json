    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. brachystelis, commonly known as the dwarf bird's-nest orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that resemble a bird's nest. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on the trunks of trees or in rock crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence with numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
