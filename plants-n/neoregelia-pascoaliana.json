It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. It produces a tall flower spike with small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Neoregelia pascoaliana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
