    "intro": "Neomitranthes, commonly known as the African starwort, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either lobed or entire, and they produce small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a disc-like structure. Neomitranthes species are often found in grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
