    "intro": "Neurolepis weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's neurolepis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
