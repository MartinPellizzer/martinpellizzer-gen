    "intro": "Nephrodium polypodiforme, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an important subject in the study of fern biology."
