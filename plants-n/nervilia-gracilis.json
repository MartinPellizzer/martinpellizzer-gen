    "intro": "Nervilia gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its root system consists of a network of rhizomes, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Nervilia gracilis is noted for its ephemeral blooming period, making it a rare and delicate sight in the botanical world."
