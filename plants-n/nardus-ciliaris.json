    "intro": "Nardus ciliaris, commonly known as lesser moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and peat bogs. Nardus ciliaris plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
