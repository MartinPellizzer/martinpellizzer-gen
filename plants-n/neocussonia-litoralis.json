    "intro": "Neocussonia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal neocussonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Neocussonia litoralis is adapted to withstand salty air and periodic tidal inundation, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
