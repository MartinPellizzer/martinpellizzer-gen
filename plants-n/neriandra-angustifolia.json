    "intro": "Neriandra angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf neriandra, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. Neriandra angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
