    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 gloriosa, commonly known as the Giant Water Lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing in the afternoon. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Nymphaea \u00d7 gloriosa is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens."
