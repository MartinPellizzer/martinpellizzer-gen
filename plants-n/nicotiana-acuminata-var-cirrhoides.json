It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
