It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
