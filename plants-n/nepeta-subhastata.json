It features slender, aromatic stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
