    "intro": "Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, commonly known as the crown gall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its vibrant green to yellowish thallus, often with a distinctive central ridge or crest. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
