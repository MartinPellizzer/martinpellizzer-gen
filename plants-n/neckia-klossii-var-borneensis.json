It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often subtended by bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
