    "intro": "Nervilia parishiana, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a dense, mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Nervilia parishiana is often found in association with other orchids and is an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
