    "intro": "Niphobolus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Its two-colored appearance comes from the contrasting pigmentation of the algal cells and the fungal matrix. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
