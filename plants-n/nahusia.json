    "intro": "Nahusia, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming cereus,\" is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. Nahusia is often cultivated for its unique beauty and its ability to bloom under moonlight."
