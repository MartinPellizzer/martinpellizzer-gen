    "intro": "Navarretia nuttallii, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Navarretia nuttallii is an herbaceous perennial that relies on seasonal snowmelt for its water needs. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
