    "intro": "Nuphar lutea var. rivularis, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a variant of the yellow water lily native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a submerged root system and produces rhizomes that help it spread in still or slow-moving waters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in ponds."
