    "intro": "Nephrolepis tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and arching in growth habit. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Nephrolepis tenuissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
