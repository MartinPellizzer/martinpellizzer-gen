    "intro": "Nymphaea devoniensis, commonly known as the Devon water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Devon, England. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water with soft, acidic soils. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nymphaea devoniensis is considered a vulnerable species."
