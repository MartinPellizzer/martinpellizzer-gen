    "intro": "Neolloydia schmiedickeana var. macrochele, commonly known as the giant neolloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach several feet in length, with a distinctive, fern-like structure. The plant produces umbellate inflorescences, typical of the carrot family, featuring small white or pale yellow flowers. Its habitat is limited to specific high-altitude regions in Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
