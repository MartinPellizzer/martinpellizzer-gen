    "intro": "Neuwiedia elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Neuwiedia elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
