It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are palmately lobed and resemble those of maple trees, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, while the fruit is a small, fleshy drupe. Neobrittonia acerifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
