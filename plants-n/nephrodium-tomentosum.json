    "intro": "Nephrodium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces fiddlehead-like spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of hairs, which gives it its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
