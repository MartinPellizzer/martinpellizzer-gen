    "intro": "Nepeta decumbens, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, are responsible for its characteristic effect on cats and its use in herbal remedies."
