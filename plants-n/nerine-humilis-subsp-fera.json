    "intro": "Nerine humilis subsp. fera, commonly known as the dwarf nerine, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants. It is also valued for its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
