    "intro": "Nepeta glechoma, commonly known as catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Nepeta glechoma is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
