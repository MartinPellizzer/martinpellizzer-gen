    "intro": "Notholaena trichomanoides var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical variety. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
