    "intro": "Neophylum artense, commonly known as the Artense Sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stem and large, bright yellow composite flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, disc-like florets surrounded by a ring of ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Neophylum artense thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
