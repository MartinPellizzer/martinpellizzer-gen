    "intro": "Neohenrya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Neohenrya has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
