    "intro": "Nephrodium costulare, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a wavy margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
