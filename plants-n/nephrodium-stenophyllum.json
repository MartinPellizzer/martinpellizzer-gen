    "intro": "Nephrodium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroid, is a rare and specialized fern species. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
