    "intro": "Newzealochilus adversus, commonly known as the Southern Alps orchid, is a rare orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is typically found in the alpine regions of the South Island. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with a single, erect stem that bears several showy flowers. Its botanical classification places it within the Orchidaceae family, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
