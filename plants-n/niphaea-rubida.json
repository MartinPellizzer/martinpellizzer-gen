    "intro": "Niphaea rubida, commonly known as the crimson water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer and early autumn. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Niphaea rubida plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
