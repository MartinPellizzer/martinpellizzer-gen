    "intro": "Notocactus macrocanthus, commonly known as the giant candlestick cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features a distinctive rib structure with prominent areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the stems. Notocactus macrocanthus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
