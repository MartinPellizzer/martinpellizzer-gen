    "intro": "Narcissus alcobacensis, commonly known as the Alcobache daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white throat and a narrow, elongated perianth. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. It blooms in early spring, usually between March and April, and is known for its delicate, bell-shaped corona. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
