    "intro": "Neottia banksiana, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to eastern North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a pair of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Neottia banksiana is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungi for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis."
