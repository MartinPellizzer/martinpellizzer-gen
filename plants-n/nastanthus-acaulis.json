    "intro": "Nastanthus acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed nasturtium, is a unique plant species characterized by its lack of true stems. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a common trait in the Brassicaceae family. Nastanthus acaulis is known for its ability to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in challenging environments."
