    "intro": "Niphogeton dissecta var. aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, still or slowly moving waters, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in aquatic botany."
