    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana var. ambigua, commonly known as the Raffles' pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant produces striking red flowers with yellow throats, which attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its pitchers are often adorned with a white rim and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various habitats, including lowland and montane rainforests."
