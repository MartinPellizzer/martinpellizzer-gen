    "intro": "Nephrodium dryopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium dryopteris plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water-dwelling organisms."
