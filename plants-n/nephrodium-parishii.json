    "intro": "Nephrodium parishii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with upright, bipinnate fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Nephrodium parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
