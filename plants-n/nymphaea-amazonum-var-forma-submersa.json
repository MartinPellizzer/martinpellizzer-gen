    "intro": "Nymphaea amazonum var. forma-submersa, commonly known as the submerged water lily, is a variant of the Amazon water lily native to the wetlands of South America. This plant is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded compared to its floating relatives. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom underwater and are adapted for pollination by aquatic insects. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
