    "intro": "Narcissus jonquilla subsp. fernandesii, commonly known as the Fernandes' daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a narrow, funnel-shaped corona. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow petals and a central, elongated trumpet. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
