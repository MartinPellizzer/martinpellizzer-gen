    "intro": "Notoceras canariense, commonly known as the Canary Islands lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in the Canary Islands. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga. Notoceras canariense plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by contributing to soil formation and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
