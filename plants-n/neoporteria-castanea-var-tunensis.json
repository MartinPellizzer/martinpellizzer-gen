    "intro": "Neoporteria castanea var. tunensis, commonly known as the Tunisian boxwood, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded growth habit. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are leathery in texture and emit a subtle aromatic scent. It is well-suited for use as a hedging plant or in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate pruning. This variety is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
