It is native to Australia and is characterized by its striking, flame-like red or orange flowers that bloom in winter. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves. Neogymnantha species are valued for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays. The flowers are often followed by woody pods that contain seeds, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats."
