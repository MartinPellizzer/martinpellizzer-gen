    "intro": "Nymphaea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features rounded, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Nymphaea pumila is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
