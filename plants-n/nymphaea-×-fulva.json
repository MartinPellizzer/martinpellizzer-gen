    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 fulva, commonly known as the red lotus, is a hybrid water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, typically opening in the early morning. Its flowers are fully submerged in water, with petals that curl tightly around the reproductive structures. Nymphaea \u00d7 fulva thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
