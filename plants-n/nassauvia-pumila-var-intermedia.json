    "intro": "Nassauvia pumila var. intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
