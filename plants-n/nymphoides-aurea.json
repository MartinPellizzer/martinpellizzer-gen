    "intro": "Nymphoides aurea, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Nymphoides aurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to improve water quality in ponds."
