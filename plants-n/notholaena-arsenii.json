    "intro": "Notholaena arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Notholaena arsenii is considered a conservation concern."
