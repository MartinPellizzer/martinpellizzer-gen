It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with alternating leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single head and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Navia culcitaria is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
