    "intro": "Norysca chinensis var. salicifolia, commonly known as the Chinese willow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
