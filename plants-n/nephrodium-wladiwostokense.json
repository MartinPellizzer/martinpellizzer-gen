    "intro": "Nephrodium wladiwostokense, commonly known as the Vladivostok nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
