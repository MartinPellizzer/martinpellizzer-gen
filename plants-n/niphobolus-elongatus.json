    "intro": "Niphobolus elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, such as water fleas and protozoa. The plant's leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips. These bladders function by rapidly expelling water to create a vacuum, suctioning in prey. Niphobolus elongatus is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in controlling microfauna populations."
