It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
