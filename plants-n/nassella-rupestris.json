    "intro": "Nassella rupestris, commonly known as the cliff grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Nassella rupestris is drought-tolerant and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments."
