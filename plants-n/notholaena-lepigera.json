It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Notholaena lepigera is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
