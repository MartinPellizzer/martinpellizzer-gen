    "intro": "Neurolepis mollis, commonly known as the silky neurolepis, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, green fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
