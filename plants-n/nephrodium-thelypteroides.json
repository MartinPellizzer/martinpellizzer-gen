    "intro": "Nephrodium thelypteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and water features."
