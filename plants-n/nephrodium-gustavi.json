    "intro": "Nephrodium gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium gustavi is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
