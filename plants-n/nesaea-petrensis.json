    "intro": "Nesaea petrensis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nesaea petrensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
