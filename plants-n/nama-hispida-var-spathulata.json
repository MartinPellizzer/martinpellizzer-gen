    "intro": "Nama hispida var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
