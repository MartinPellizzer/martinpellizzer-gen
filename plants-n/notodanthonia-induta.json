    "intro": "Notodanthonia induta, commonly known as the narrow leaf grass, is a species of grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Notodanthonia induta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
