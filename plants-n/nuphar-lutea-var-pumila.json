It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often green with a yellowish underside. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. The species is characterized by its compact size compared to other Nuphar species, making it well-suited for smaller water gardens."
