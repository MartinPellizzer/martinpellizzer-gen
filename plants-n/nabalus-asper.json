    "intro": "Nabalus asper, commonly known as the rough hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Nabalus asper is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient species within its native habitat."
