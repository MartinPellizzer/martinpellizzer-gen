    "intro": "Neottia tortilis, commonly known as the twisted snake orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and its striking, snake-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose cluster. Neottia tortilis is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
