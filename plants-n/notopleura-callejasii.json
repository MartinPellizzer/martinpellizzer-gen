    "intro": "Notopleura callejasii, commonly known as the Callejas' notopleura, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or humid lowland areas. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
