    "intro": "Nephrodium hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
