It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Notholaena arequipensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
