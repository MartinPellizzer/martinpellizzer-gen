It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that display vibrant purple and white hues. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.
