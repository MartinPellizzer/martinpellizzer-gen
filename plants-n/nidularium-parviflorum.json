    "intro": "Nidularium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered nidularium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Nidularium parviflorum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
