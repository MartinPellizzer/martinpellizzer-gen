    "intro": "Notholaena nivea, commonly known as the white fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
