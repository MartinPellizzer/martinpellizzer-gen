    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. tuberosa, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a cultivar of the common sword fern. It is characterized by its elegant, arching fronds that are typically bright green and feathery in appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect light. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
