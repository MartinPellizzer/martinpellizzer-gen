    "intro": "Nemopanthus lucidus, commonly known as the shining ghostplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands, often forming dense mats near the forest floor. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are bell-shaped and range in color from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Nemopanthus lucidus is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
