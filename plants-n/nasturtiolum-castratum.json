    "intro": "Nasturtiolum castratum, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments and has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are often submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Nasturtiolum castratum is also valued as a food source for aquatic animals and can contribute to water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
