    "intro": "Nymphaea passiflora, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Americas, is a striking aquatic plant native to the warm regions of the Americas. It features large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with a prominent central crown of stamens. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots grow in the muddy substrate, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Nymphaea passiflora is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and cultural significance."
