    "intro": "Nephrostigma, commonly known as the kidney-shaped stigma, is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants. It is typically located at the base of the ovary and serves as the receptive site for pollen grains during fertilization. The structure is often covered in fine hairs that aid in the adhesion of pollen. Its shape and surface characteristics vary among species, influencing pollination efficiency. Nephrostigma plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of angiosperms."
