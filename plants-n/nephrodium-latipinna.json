    "intro": "Nephrodium latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leaf nephroid, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that float on the water's surface. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. The plant has a simple, branching structure with no true roots, relying on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically green and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Nephrodium latipinna plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
