    "intro": "Neurocarpum simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leafed neurocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
