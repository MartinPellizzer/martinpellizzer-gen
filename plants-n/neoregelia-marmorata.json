    "intro": "Neoregelia marmorata, commonly known as the marble plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, mottled foliage that ranges from green to silver and purple. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, which appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia marmorata is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and ease of care."
