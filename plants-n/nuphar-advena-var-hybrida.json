    "intro": "Nuphar advena var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are usually yellowish-green in color. The plant produces white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through water bodies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight."
