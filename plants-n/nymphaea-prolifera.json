    "intro": "Nymphaea prolifera, commonly known as the spreading water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems and leaves float on the surface. Nymphaea prolifera is known for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through runners, which allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
