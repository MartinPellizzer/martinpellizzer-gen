    "intro": "Neuracanthus tephrophyllus subsp. conifer, commonly known as the coniferous neuracanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique morphological adaptations. It exhibits a distinct conifer-like structure, with needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant is native to high-altitude regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its reproductive system involves small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common strategy in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
