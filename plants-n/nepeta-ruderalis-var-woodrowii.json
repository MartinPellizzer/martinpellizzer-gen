It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Woodrow's catnip is also noted for its mild nepetalactone content, which can have a stimulating effect on cats."
