    "intro": "Neolitsea sutchuanensis f. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-fruited Chinese laurustin, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is distinguished by its elongated, pedicellate fruits, which set it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
