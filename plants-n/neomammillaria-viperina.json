    "intro": "Neomammillaria viperina, commonly known as the viper's tail cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or yellowish spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Neomammillaria viperina is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
