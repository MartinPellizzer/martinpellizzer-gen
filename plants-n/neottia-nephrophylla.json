    "intro": "Neottia nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidney-leaf twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, kidney-shaped leaves and slender, unbranched stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Neottia nephrophylla is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its lack of showy petals, relying instead on its unique leaf structure for photosynthesis."
