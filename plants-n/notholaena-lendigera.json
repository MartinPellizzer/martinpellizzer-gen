    "intro": "Notholaena lendigera, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena lendigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
