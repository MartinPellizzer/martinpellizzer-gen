It is characterized by its unique, delicate leaves that often appear translucent or veined with a ghostly appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. Nemodaphne species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries."
