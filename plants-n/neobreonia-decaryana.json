    "intro": "Neobreonia decaryana, commonly known as the yellow lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Neobreonia decaryana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and foliage, which add visual interest throughout the growing season."
