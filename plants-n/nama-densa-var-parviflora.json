    "intro": "Nama densa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nama, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features dense, wiry stems and small, usually white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
