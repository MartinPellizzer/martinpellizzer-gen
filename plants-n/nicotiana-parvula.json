    "intro": "Nicotiana parvula, commonly known as the smallflower tobacco, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which can produce a sticky substance. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Nicotiana parvula is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its visual appeal."
