    "intro": "Nephrolepis acuminata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Nephrolepis acuminata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor cultivation."
