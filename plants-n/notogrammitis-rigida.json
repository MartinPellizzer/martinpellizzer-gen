    "intro": "Notogrammitis rigida, commonly known as rigid wall-rush, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are typically 20\u201350 cm in length. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinct midrib and small, ovate pinnae. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
