    "intro": "Nepenthes platychila, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a slender stem and elongated, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a prominent red rim that serves as an attractant for prey. Nepenthes platychila is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
