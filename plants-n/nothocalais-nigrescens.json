    "intro": "Nothocalais nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dark purple to black in color. Nothocalais nigrescens is native to southeastern Australia and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its parasitic nature allows it to obtain water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent."
