    "intro": "Nymphaea polystigma, commonly known as the African white lotus, is a water-living plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps it stay buoyant on water. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea polystigma plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
