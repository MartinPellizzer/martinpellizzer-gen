    "intro": "Niphobolus sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in the understory of dense forests, relying on specific host trees for support. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Niphobolus sarasinorum is considered a critically endangered species."
