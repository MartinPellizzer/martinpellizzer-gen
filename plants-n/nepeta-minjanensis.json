    "intro": "Nepeta minjanensis, commonly known as the Minjan mountain catmint, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Nepeta genus."
