    "intro": "Nymphaea semiaperta, commonly known as the semi-open water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the sediment, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
