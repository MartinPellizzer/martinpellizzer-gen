    "intro": "Nepenthes montrouzieri, commonly known as the Montrouzier's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a nutrient-rich liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which help attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
