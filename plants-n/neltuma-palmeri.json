    "intro": "Neltuma palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's neltuma, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neltuma palmeri is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
