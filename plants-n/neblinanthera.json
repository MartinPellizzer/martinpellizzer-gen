    "intro": "Neblinanthera, commonly known as the mist orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces nectar that attracts various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Neblinanthera is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
