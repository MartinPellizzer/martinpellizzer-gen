    "intro": "Nephrodium zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesi water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are subterranean, with sporocarps that release spores into the water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
