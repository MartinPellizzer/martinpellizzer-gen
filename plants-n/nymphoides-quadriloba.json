    "intro": "Nymphoides quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Nymphoides quadriloba thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
