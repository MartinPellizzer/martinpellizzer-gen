    "intro": "Nauplius, commonly known as the larval stage of crustaceans, is not a plant but a type of aquatic larva. It is characterized by a simple body structure with a single eye, a pair of antennae, and biramous appendages. Nauplii are typically found in marine and freshwater environments, where they feed on plankton. They undergo a series of metamorphosis stages before developing into adult crustaceans. This stage is crucial for the life cycle of many species within the phylum Arthropoda."
