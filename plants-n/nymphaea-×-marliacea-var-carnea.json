    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 marliacea var. carnea, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features showy, semi-herbaceous leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. The plant produces large, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
