    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. tingitana, commonly known as the Tingitana daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is native to southern Spain and northern Africa, where it thrives in limestone soils. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a single tepal, typical of the daffodil genus. Its botanical characteristics include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
