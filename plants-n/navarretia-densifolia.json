    "intro": "Navarretia densifolia, commonly known as the denseflower sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The species belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Navarretia densifolia blooms in early spring, producing bright pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
