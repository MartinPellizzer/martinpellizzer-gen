    "intro": "Nothocarpus, commonly known as the false cypress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cupressaceae. It consists of a single species, Nothocarpus helianthifolius, which is native to the Caribbean islands. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conifer-like appearance, with scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish color, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Despite its resemblance to cypress trees, Nothocarpus is not closely related to true cypresses."
