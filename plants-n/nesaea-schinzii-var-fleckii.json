    "intro": "Nesaea schinzii var. fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's nesaea, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowering period occurs during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
