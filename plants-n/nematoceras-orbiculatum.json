    "intro": "Nematoceras orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbiculate liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant has a flattened, leaf-like structure with a distinct central rib, and its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It is characterized by its ability to retain water and its resistance to desiccation, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Nematoceras orbiculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
