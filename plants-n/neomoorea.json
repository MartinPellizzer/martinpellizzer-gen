    "intro": "Neomoorea, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Neomoorea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
