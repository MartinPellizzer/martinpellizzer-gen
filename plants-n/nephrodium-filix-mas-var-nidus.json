    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. nidus, commonly known as the basket fern, is a variant of the common nephrolepis. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new plantlets at the nodes. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a textured surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
