It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Nolana diffusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, long-lasting blooms."
