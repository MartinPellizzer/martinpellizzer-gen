    "intro": "Napaea laevis, commonly known as the smooth napaea, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Napaea laevis is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
