    "intro": "Nymphaea wittiana, commonly known as the African white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea wittiana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
