    "intro": "Napeanthus robustus, commonly known as the African snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Napeanthus robustus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add early-season color to gardens."
