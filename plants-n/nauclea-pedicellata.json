It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Nauclea pedicellata is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in carpentry and as a source of essential oils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
