    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. cincta, commonly known as the white water lily with a white border, is a variant of the white water lily native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its large, rounded, white petals that are often edged with a lighter, almost translucent band. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and float on the water's surface, while its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
