    "intro": "Nervilia adolphi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Nervilia adolphi thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of forests."
