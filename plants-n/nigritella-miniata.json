    "intro": "Nigritella miniata, commonly known as the dwarf black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black flowers that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique coloration and compact size make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in its native range."
