    "intro": "Nauchea multiflora, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Nauchea multiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
