    "intro": "Notholaena trichomanoides var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur fern, is a variant of the native fern species found in New Zealand. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange fronds, which are particularly striking when they emerge in spring. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its fronds are lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. This variant is notable for its vivid coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
