    "intro": "Nepenthes macrovulgaris, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, used to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique structure includes a modified leaf that forms the pitcher, with a lid to prevent rainwater from diluting the digestive fluids. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in swampy or montane regions. Its striking appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
