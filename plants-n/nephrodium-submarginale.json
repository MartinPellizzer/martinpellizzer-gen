    "intro": "Nephrodium submarginale, commonly known as the narrow-margin fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive narrow margin that sets it apart from other fern species. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
