    "intro": "Neustruevia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a unique plant characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit. It produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by morning, adapting to low-light conditions. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. Neustruevia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract nocturnal pollinators."
