    "intro": "Neillia thibetica var. duclouxii, commonly known as the Tibetan Neillia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical features make it of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
