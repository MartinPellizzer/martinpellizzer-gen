    "intro": "Nanodes, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are herbaceous, often growing as annuals or perennials, with alternate leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. Nanodes species are characterized by their slender stems and hairy foliage, which help in identifying them in the field. They are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
