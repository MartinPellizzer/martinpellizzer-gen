    "intro": "Nierembergia, commonly known as the \"golden bell\" or \"cup flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials, often in rocky or arid environments. Their foliage is usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers are often clustered in terminal racemes. Nierembergia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
