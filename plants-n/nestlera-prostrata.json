    "intro": "Nestlera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate nestlera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
