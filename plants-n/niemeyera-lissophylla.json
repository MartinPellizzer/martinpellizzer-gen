    "intro": "Niemeyera lissophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Niemeyera lissophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
