    "intro": "Nania gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sap, which is thick and sticky, has been used by Indigenous communities for various traditional purposes. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils."
