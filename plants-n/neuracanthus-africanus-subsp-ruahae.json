    "intro": "Neuracanthus africanus subsp. ruahae, commonly known as the Ruahae Neuracanthus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat degradation, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
