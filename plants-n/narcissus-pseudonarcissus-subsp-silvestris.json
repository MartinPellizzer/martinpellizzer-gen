    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. silvestris, commonly known as the wild daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, upright stem bearing a large, showy yellow flower with a central corona. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in the bulbous flora. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more robust growth compared to other daffodil varieties."
