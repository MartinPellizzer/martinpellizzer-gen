    "intro": "Neuropeltis prevosteoides, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
