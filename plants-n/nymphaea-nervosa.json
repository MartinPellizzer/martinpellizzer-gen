    "intro": "Nymphaea nervosa, commonly known as the slender water lily, is a aquatic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water, and its stems are often covered in fine, delicate hairs. Nymphaea nervosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
