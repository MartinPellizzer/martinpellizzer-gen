    "intro": "Nervilia marmorata, commonly known as the marble fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that display a delicate pattern of light and dark green, resembling marble. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Nervilia marmorata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its natural habitat."
