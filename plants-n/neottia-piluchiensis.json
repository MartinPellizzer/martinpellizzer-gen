    "intro": "Neottia piluchiensis, commonly known as the Piluch\u00e9 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike bearing several small, greenish-white blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understorey of dense forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia piluchiensis is notable for its lack of a prominent pseudobulb, a feature common in many orchid species."
