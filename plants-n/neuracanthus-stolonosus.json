    "intro": "Neuracanthus stolonosus, commonly known as the creeping false heather, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
