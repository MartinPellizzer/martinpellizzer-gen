    "intro": "Nenuphar luteum, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland habitats. Nenuphar luteum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
