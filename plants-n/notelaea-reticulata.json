    "intro": "Notelaea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a red or purple throat. The leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
