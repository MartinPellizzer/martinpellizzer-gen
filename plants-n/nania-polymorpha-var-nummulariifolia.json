    "intro": "Nania polymorpha var. nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage. The leaves are small, round, and leathery, giving the plant a compact, mat-like appearance. It produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
