    "intro": "Nassella caespitosa, commonly known as blue grama, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, clump-like growths, typically reaching heights of 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with blue or purple hues, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, blue-gray in color, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is an important component of native grasslands."
