    "intro": "Navarretia aeroides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a delicate annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the flowering plant family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as coastal bluffs and dry slopes. Its unique appearance and ephemeral blooming period make it a striking yet short-lived component of its ecosystem. Navarretia aeroides is also notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
