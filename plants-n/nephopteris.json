    "intro": "Nephopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Nephopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. They have rhizomes that are usually short and produce a dense network of roots. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
