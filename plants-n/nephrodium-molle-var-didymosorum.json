    "intro": "Nephrodium molle var. didymosorum, commonly known as the soft nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically light green and covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
