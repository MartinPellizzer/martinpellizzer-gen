    "intro": "Nuttallia densa, commonly known as the dense nuttallia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Nuttallia densa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
