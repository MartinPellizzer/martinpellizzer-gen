    "intro": "Nogalia drepanophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Nogalia drepanophylla is often found in rocky outcrops and open grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
