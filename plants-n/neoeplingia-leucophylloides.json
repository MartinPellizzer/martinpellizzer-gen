    "intro": "Neoeplingia leucophylloides, commonly known as the white-leafed orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink, during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for terrariums and greenhouses. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
