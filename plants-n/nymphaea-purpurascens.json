    "intro": "Nymphaea purpurascens, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea purpurascens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in various regions."
