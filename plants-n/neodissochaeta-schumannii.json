    "intro": "Neodissochaeta schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Neodissochaeta schumannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
