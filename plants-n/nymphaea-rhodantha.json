    "intro": "Nymphaea rhodantha, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink petals and large, broad leaves that float on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The botanical features of Nymphaea rhodantha make it a popular ornamental plant in aquatic gardens and a symbol of purity in various cultures."
