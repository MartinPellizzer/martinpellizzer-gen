    "intro": "Notophaena, commonly known as the common sand thorn, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in small clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Notophaena species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in their native habitats."
