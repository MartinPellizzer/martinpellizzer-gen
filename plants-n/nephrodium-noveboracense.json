    "intro": "Nephrodium noveboracense, commonly known as the New York kidney fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, kidney-shaped sorus on the underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The New York kidney fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
