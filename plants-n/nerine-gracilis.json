    "intro": "Nerine gracilis, commonly known as the slender nerine, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, making it a striking addition to gardens during that season. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Nerine gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care."
