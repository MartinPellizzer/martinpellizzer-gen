    "intro": "Nycteranthus fragilis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short lifespan, with flowers blooming only for a few hours before closing and wilting. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nycteranthus fragilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
