    "intro": "Neotatea neblinae, commonly known as the misty neotropical palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Neotatea neblinae plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various endemic species."
