    "intro": "Newcastelia bracteosa, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense mat of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Newcastelia bracteosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
