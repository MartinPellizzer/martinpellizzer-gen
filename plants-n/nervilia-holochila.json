    "intro": "Nervilia holochila, commonly known as the slender lady's-tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Nervilia holochila is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing in late spring or early summer."
