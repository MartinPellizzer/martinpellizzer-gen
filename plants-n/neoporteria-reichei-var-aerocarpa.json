    "intro": "Neoporteria reichei var. aerocarpa, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
