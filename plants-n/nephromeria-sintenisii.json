    "intro": "Nephromeria sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephromeria sintenisii is considered a critically endangered plant."
