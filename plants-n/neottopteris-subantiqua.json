It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, shield-shaped frond that is typically divided into several segments. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Neottopteris subantiqua plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
