    "intro": "Neobakeria haemanthoides, commonly known as the red-stemmed candleplant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Neobakeria haemanthoides is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
