    "intro": "Nephrodium serratodentatum, commonly known as the serrated-toothed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive frond structure with deeply serrated margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The botanical study of Nephrodium serratodentatum contributes to the understanding of fern diversity and ecological adaptation in tropical environments."
