    "intro": "Narcissus portensis var. albidotepaloideus, commonly known as the white tepaloid daffodil, is a rare and ornamental variant of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which feature a distinctive lack of a prominent corona, giving it a more uniform appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often in clusters of 2\u20134, and are highly valued for their delicate beauty. This variety is native to the island of Porto Santo in the Azores and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique coloration and floral structure."
