It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae, which includes a variety of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically features broad, fleshy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for water environments. It is native to regions with warm, humid climates and thrives in shallow, still waters. Its botanical structure supports its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
