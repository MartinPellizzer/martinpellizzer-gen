    "intro": "Nolletia rarifolia, commonly known as the rare-leaf nolletia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Nolletia rarifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
