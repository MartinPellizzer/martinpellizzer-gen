    "intro": "Nymphaea radiata, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are large, showy, and usually white or pink in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Its flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea radiata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
