It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of sky-blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and evergreen, providing a basal rosette that supports the flowering stems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
