    "intro": "Nolina beldingii, commonly known as the Belding's nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, a feature typical of succulent plants. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on a tall, branched inflorescence during the spring or early summer. Nolina beldingii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
