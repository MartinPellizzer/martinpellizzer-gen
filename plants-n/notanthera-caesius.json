    "intro": "Notanthera caesius, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Notanthera caesius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
