It is characterized by its flexible, slender stems that exhibit a creeping growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other forms. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies of plant morphology and adaptation."
