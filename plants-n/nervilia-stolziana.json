    "intro": "Nervilia stolziana, commonly known as the Stolzian fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Nervilia stolziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
