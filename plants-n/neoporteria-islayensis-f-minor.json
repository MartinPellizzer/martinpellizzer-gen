    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis f. minor, commonly known as the Islay dwarf neoporteria, is a rare and diminutive variant of the neoporteria genus. It is native to the Scottish island of Islay, where it thrives in damp, acidic heathland environments. This fern-like plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its small size and unique morphology make it a distinctive member of the neoporteria family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
