    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis var. divaricatiflora, commonly known as the Islay bellflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Scottish island of Islay. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
