    "intro": "Naegelia multiflora, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Naegelia multiflora is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
