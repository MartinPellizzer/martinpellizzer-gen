    "intro": "Nasturtium flexicaule, commonly known as the creeping nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of orange and yellow, typically with four petals arranged in a cross shape. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Nasturtium flexicaule is known for its edible flowers and leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
