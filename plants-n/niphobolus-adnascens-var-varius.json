    "intro": "Niphobolus adnascens var. varius, commonly known as the variable climbing fern, is a variant of the climbing fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of aerial roots that help it attach to trees and other structures. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the fronds are usually bipinnate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
