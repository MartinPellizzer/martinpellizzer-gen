    "intro": "Nasturtium fluviatile, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has heart-shaped, peppery-tasting leaves that are often used in salads. It thrives in moist environments such as streams, ditches, and wet meadows. Nasturtium fluviatile is known for its ability to purify water and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
