    "intro": "Nigritella austriaca subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian nigritella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and exhibits seasonal flowering, usually in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
