    "intro": "Norysca coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved norysca, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and deep-rooted, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Norysca coriacea is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it demonstrates a high degree of drought tolerance."
