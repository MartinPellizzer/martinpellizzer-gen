    "intro": "Nepenthes burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's red or orange-colored pitchers are often adorned with a white or yellow rim, which attracts prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Its specialized adaptations make it an important species in the study of plant carnivory and ecological interactions."
