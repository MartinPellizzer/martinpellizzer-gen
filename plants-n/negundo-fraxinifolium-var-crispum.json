    "intro": "Negundo fraxinifolium var. crispum, commonly known as the curly-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its uniquely crinkled or curled leaves. The foliage is typically a vibrant green during the growing season, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ash species. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for urban landscapes and ornamental planting."
