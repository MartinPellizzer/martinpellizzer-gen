It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety texture and a deep green coloration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with yellow spadices and purple bracts, which are typical of its genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts specializing in tropical plants."
