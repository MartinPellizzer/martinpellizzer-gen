    "intro": "Notelaea monticola, commonly known as the mountain notelaea, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or exposed sites, reflecting its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Notelaea monticola is also noted for its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring."
