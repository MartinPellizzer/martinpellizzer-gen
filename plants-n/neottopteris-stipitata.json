    "intro": "Neottopteris stipitata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are clustered and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
