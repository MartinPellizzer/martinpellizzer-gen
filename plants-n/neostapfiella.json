    "intro": "Neostapfiella, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. Neostapfiella species are found primarily in China and are adapted to grow in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both parasitic and free-living stages. Due to its specialized nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite."
