    "intro": "Nidularium campos-portoi, commonly known as the Brazilian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellowish-orange spathe and a spadix that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the moist, nutrient-rich soils of its habitat. Nidularium campos-portoi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous animals."
