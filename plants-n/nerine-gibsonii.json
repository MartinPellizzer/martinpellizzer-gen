It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive red throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Nerine gibsonii is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
