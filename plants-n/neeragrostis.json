    "intro": "Neeragrostis, commonly known as silvergrass, is a genus of grasses native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Neeragrostis species are characterized by their fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences. They have narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib and often form dense, low-growing mats. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including erosion control and habitat provision for wildlife."
