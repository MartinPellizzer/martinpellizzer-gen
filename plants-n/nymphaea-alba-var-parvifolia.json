    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. parvifolia, commonly known as the white water lily with small leaves, is a variant of the white water lily native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It features broad, rounded, pale green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Nymphaea alba. The flowers are large, white, and showy, with a yellow center, blooming in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and lakes. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
