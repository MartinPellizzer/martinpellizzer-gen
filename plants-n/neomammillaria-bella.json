    "intro": "Neomammillaria bella, commonly known as the bell mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short stem and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Neomammillaria bella is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
