    "intro": "Nymphaea basniniana, commonly known as the Basnian water lily, is a species of water lily native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the day and closing at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea basniniana plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
