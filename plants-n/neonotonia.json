    "intro": "Neonotonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Neonotonia species are typically herbaceous, with upright stems and clustered foliage. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, such as Neonotonia wightii, which is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value."
