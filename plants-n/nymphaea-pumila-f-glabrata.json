    "intro": "Nymphaea pumila f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth water lily, is a compact aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct yellowish center, and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring shallow waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, glossy appearance."
