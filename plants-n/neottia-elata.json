    "intro": "Neottia elata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant is epiphytic in some habitats but often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia elata has a well-developed root system and produces a single, elongated flower spike. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other orchid species in similar habitats."
