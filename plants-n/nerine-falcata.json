    "intro": "Nerine falcata, commonly known as the sword lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant blooms in late summer to early autumn, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Nerine falcata is also noted for its ability to naturalize and spread through offsets, creating dense clusters over time."
