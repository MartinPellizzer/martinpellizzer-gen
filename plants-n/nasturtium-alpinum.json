    "intro": "Nasturtium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. The plant produces heart-shaped, edible leaves that have a peppery taste, similar to watercress. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nasturtium alpinum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
