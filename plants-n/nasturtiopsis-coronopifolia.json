    "intro": "Nasturtiopsis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf watercress, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are slender and often root in shallow water, allowing it to thrive in wetland environments. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and ecological contexts."
