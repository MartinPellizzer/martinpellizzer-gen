    "intro": "Nertera gracilis, commonly known as the baby's tears plant, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves that form a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Nertera gracilis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
