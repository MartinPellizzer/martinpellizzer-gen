It consists of several species native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which often have a pinnate or bipinnate structure. They produce small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Nothopanax species are often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and understory habitats."
