    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum nudum, commonly known as the naked cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, pale green fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Nephelaphyllum nudum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
