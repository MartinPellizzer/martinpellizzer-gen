    "intro": "Neoceis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. Neoceis is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it remains a subject of botanical study and fascination."
