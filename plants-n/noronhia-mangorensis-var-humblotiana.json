    "intro": "Noronhia mangorensis var. humblotiana, commonly known as the Humblot's noronhia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is a woody shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
