    "intro": "Neottianthe cucullata var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
