It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
