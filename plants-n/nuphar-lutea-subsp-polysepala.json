    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. polysepala, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, with a distinct, cup-shaped structure. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
