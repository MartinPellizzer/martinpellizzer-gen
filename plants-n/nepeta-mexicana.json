    "intro": "Nepeta mexicana, commonly known as Mexican catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta mexicana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
