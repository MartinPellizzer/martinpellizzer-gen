    "intro": "Nassella brachyglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Nassella brachyglumis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
