    "intro": "Notopora, commonly known as the \"cushion lichen,\" is a type of foliose lichen that forms dense, mat-like growths on rocks and soil. It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrient absorption. Notopora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
