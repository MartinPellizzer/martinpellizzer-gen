    "intro": "Neottia alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, alternate leaves and a single, slender flower spike. Neottia alternifolia is known for its mycorrhizal association, relying on fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant-fungi interactions and ecological adaptations."
