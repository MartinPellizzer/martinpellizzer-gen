It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it is often found growing along forest edges or in disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
