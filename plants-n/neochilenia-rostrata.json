    "intro": "Neochilenia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flattened layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture and distinct isidiate and rhizinate structures. It thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, often found in deserts or rocky outcrops. This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential role in soil stabilization in harsh environments."
