    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis var. curassavica, commonly known as the Guadalupine watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas. It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater stands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of N. guadalupensis."
