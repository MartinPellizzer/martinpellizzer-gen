    "intro": "Negretia pruriens, commonly known as the itching leaf or poison leaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine, irritating hair, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its sap contains toxic compounds, contributing to its reputation as a noxious plant. Negretia pruriens is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its harmful properties."
