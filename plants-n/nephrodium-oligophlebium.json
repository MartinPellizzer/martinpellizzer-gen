    "intro": "Nephrodium oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with closely spaced, narrow veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium oligophlebium is considered a vulnerable plant species."
