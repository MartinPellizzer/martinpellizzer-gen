    "intro": "Nigella sativa var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow cumin or citron nigella, is a variant of the black cumin species native to South and Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish seeds, which are smaller and more aromatic than those of the typical Nigella sativa. The plant produces small, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The botanical features of this variety make it a valuable crop for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
