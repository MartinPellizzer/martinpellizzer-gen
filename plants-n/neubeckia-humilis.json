    "intro": "Neubeckia humilis, commonly known as the lesser beggar's-ticks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for ground cover in moist, shaded areas. It is often found in woodland settings and is known for its ability to thrive in partially to fully shaded conditions. Neubeckia humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
