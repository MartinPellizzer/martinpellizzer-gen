    "intro": "Nissolia latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved nissolia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
