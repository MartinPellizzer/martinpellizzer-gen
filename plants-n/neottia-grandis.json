    "intro": "Neottia grandis, commonly known as the large broad-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its lack of above-ground leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its underground rhizomes and roots. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests. Neottia grandis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
