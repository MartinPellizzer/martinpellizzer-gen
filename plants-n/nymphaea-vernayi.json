    "intro": "Nymphaea vernayi, commonly known as the Congo water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of water bodies. Nymphaea vernayi plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland environments."
