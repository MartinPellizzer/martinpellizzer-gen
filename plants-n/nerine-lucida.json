    "intro": "Nerine lucida, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow the plant to survive dry periods and regrow each season. Nerine lucida is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
