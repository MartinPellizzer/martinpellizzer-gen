    "intro": "Notholaena leonina, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from its unique, fluffy seed heads that resemble a lion's tail, which persist through the winter. Notholaena leonina thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
