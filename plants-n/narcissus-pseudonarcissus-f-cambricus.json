It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers with a white throat and narrow, strap-like leaves. Native to the coastal regions of Wales, this cultivar thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is typically found in maritime climates, where it withstands salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in British horticulture."
