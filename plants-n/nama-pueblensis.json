    "intro": "Nama pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Nama pueblensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems."
