    "intro": "Neobaumannia hedyotoidea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Neobaumannia hedyotoidea plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
