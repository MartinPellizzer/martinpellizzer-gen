    "intro": "Nepeta elegantissima, commonly known as the Persian catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage that emits a minty aroma when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Nepeta elegantissima is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
