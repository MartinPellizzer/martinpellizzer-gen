    "intro": "Notholaena chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy texture and a distinctive, pale green coloration. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
