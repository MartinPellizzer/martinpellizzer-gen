    "intro": "Nymphoides hydrocharoides, commonly known as water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers that are often white or pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of the water body while its stems extend upward to support the leaves and flowers. Nymphoides hydrocharoides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
