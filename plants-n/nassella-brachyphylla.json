    "intro": "Nassella brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Nassella brachyphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
