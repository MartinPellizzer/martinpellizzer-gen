    "intro": "Nicotiana insecticida, commonly known as the insect-killing tobacco, is a species native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant contains nicotine and other alkaloids, which contribute to its insecticidal properties. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in pest control."
