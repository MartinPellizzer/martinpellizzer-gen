    "intro": "Nageia elongata, commonly known as the longleaf nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact foliage. The tree produces unique, elongated cones that hang from the branches, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of the cypress family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in old-growth forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia elongata is considered a vulnerable species."
