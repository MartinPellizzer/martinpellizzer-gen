It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. Navarretia divaricata is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
