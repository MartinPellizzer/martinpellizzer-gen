    "intro": "Nephrodium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded habitats. Nephrodium glabratum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
