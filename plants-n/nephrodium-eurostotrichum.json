It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
