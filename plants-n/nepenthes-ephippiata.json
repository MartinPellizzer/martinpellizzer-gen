    "intro": "Nepenthes ephippiata, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its habitat is typically in shaded, humid environments with nutrient-poor soil. Nepenthes ephippiata is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
