    "intro": "Nepenthes tupmanniana, commonly known as the Tupman's pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 2 liters of liquid. The plant produces striking red flowers with yellow markings, which attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, lowland habitat. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
