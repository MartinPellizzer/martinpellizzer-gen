    "intro": "Neottopteris vulgaris, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Neottopteris vulgaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
