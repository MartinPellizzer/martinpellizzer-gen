    "intro": "Neotinea tridentata subsp. commutata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in damp meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
