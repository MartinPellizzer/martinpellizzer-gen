    "intro": "Narcissus supramontanus, commonly known as the alpine daffodil, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers with a prominent central corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Narcissus supramontanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
