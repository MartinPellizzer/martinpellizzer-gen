    "intro": "Nymphoides tenuissima, commonly known as the slender water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies. Nymphoides tenuissima is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
