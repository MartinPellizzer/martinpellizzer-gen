    "intro": "Neurada, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is native to the wetlands of Asia, particularly India and China, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. Its leaves are broad and circular, often floating on the water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Neurada has been culturally and spiritually significant in various traditions for centuries."
