    "intro": "Neomammillaria sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
