    "intro": "Nephrodium polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leafed nephroid, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium polyphyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
