    "intro": "Nemopanthus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian silverweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery underside. Nemopanthus canadensis is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
