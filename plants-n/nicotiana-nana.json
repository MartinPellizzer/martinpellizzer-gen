    "intro": "Nicotiana nana, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it distinct from its larger relatives. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its glandular hairs on the foliage. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a garden plant."
