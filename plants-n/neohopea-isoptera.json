    "intro": "Neohopea isoptera, commonly known as the white-flowered ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. Neohopea isoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
