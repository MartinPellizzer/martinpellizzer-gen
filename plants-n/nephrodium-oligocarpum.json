    "intro": "Nephrodium oligocarpum, commonly known as the small-fruit nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephridiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, clustered sporangia that contribute to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
