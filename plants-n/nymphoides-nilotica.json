    "intro": "Nymphoides nilotica, commonly known as the African water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and its flowers are showy, typically white or pink, with a yellow center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it plays a role in water filtration and habitat provision for aquatic life."
