    "intro": "Nymphaea versicolor, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a aquatic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that can change color depending on environmental conditions. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its stems and leaves remain above the water surface. Nymphaea versicolor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
