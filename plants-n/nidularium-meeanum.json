    "intro": "Nidularium meeanum, commonly known as the Meean's basket plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces striking, showy flowers that are often red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
