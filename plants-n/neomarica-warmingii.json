    "intro": "Neomarica warmingii, commonly known as the Chinese flame lily, is a striking orchid native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neomarica warmingii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
