    "intro": "Nothorhipsalis lorentziana, commonly known as the Lorentziana string plant, is a hybrid epiphytic cactus native to South America. It features long, thin stems that hang in cascading clusters, giving it a unique, vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in hanging baskets or as a decorative foliage plant."
