It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs, which are similar to onions, are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. Nothoscordum cuyanum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
