    "intro": "Neonauclea kobbei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Neonauclea kobbei is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
