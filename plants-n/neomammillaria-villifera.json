    "intro": "Neomammillaria villifera, commonly known as the feathered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Neomammillaria villifera is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
