    "intro": "Noccaea procumbens proles tournefortii, commonly known as the creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments."
