    "intro": "Nephrodium trianae, commonly known as the Triana's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Nephrodium trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
