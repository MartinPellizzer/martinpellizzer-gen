    "intro": "Neltuma glandulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular neltuma, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may play a role in defense against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with woody stems that can persist for several years. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
