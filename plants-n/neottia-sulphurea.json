    "intro": "Neottia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, narrow, yellowish-green leaf. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, often with a faint sulfur-like odor, which is characteristic of the genus. Neottia sulphurea is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to biodiversity."
