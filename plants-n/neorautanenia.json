    "intro": "Neorautanenia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Comoros. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. Neorautanenia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their natural habitats. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
