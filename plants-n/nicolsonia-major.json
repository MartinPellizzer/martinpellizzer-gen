    "intro": "Nicolsonia major, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from yellow to orange. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Nicolsonia major is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and birds, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
