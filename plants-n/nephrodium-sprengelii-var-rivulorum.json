    "intro": "Nephrodium sprengelii var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river nephroid, is a rare aquatic fern found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant thrives in cool, oxygen-rich waters and is often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
