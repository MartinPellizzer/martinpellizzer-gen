    "intro": "Neomimosa russellii, commonly known as Russell's mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Neomimosa russellii is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, similar to the common mimosa pudica."
