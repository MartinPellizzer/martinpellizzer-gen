    "intro": "Nepenthes vieillardii var. deplanchei, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a species of tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that form the pitcher, with a lid-like structure to prevent rainwater from diluting the digestive enzymes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity for optimal growth. This variant is notable for its robust growth and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
