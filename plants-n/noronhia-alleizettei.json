    "intro": "Noronhia alleizettei, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, grey bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
