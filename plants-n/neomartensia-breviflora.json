    "intro": "Neomartensia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered neomartensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Neomartensia breviflora thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
