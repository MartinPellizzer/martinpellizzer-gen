    "intro": "Nymphaea victoria, commonly known as the Victoria water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon. The plant has broad, waxy green leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea victoria is known for its unique ability to trap small animals beneath its leaves, which are then digested by the plant."
