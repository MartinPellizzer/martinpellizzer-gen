    "intro": "Nassella trachyphylla, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Nassella trachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
