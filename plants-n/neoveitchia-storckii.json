    "intro": "Neoveitchia storckii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, featuring a thick, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of gymnosperms. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
