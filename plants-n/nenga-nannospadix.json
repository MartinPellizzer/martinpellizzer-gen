It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored inflorescence that resembles a ghostly shape, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its unusual reproductive structures, which include a spadix and a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and elusive nature, it is often difficult to study and cultivate."
