    "intro": "Neottia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neottia yunnanensis is considered a conservation concern."
