    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 leoni, commonly known as the hybrid southern beech, is a natural hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nothofagus fusca and Nothofagus truncata. It belongs to the family Nothofagaceae and is native to southern South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It typically grows in temperate rainforests and is adapted to moist, cool climates with high humidity. The hybrid exhibits morphological traits that are intermediate between its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
