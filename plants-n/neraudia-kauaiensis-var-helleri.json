    "intro": "Neraudia kauaiensis var. helleri, commonly known as the Kauai mountain mint, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
