    "intro": "Nephrodium crinibulbon, commonly known as the feathered bladder fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive feathery appearance due to the arrangement of its pinnae. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. It has a specialized root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced in clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
