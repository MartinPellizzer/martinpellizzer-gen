    "intro": "Nycteranthus rabiei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival due to habitat destruction and climate change."
