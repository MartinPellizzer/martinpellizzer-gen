    "intro": "Neuroloma speciosum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and clusters of delicate, fragrant white and purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for continued preservation."
