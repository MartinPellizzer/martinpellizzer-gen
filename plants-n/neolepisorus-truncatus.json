    "intro": "Neolepisorus truncatus, commonly known as the truncated rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and small, clustered fronds. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a truncate or rounded base, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family."
