    "intro": "Narcissus minor subsp. asturiensis, commonly known as the Asturian daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and scrub habitats. It is a low-growing perennial bulbous plant with a compact habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
