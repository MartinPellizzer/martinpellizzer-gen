    "intro": "Nymphaea formosa, commonly known as the white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its most notable characteristic is the large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun exposure. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
