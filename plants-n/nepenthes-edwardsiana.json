    "intro": "Nepenthes edwardsiana, commonly known as the \"Edwards' pitcher plant,\" is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the highland regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a sweet-smelling nectar to lure prey into its modified leaves, which are lined with downward-pointing hairs to prevent escape. Its pitchers can reach up to 30 centimeters in height and are typically green or reddish in color. Nepenthes edwardsiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
