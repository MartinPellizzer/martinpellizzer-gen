    "intro": "Nicotiana viscosocordata, commonly known as sticky heartleaf tobacco, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
