    "intro": "Nemophila menziesii subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which set it apart from other Nemophila species."
