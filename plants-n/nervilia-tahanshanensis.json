    "intro": "Nervilia tahanshanensis, commonly known as the Taihang mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Taihang Mountains of China. It belongs to the family Nerviliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
