    "intro": "Nidularium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed nest fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like margins on its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Nidularium denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
