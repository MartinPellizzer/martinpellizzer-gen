    "intro": "Nephrodium etchichuryi, commonly known as the Etchichuryi's kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium etchichuryi is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
