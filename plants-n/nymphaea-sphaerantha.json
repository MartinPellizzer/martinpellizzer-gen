It is characterized by its large, round, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a prominent yellow center. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still water.
