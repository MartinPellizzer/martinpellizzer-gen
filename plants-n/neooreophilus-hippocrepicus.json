    "intro": "Neooreophilus hippocrepicus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped leaves and small, fragrant blossoms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Neooreophilus hippocrepicus is considered endangered in its natural range."
