    "intro": "Nothopanax gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' nothopanax, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Nothopanax gunnii is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
