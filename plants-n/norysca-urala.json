    "intro": "Norysca urala, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, arctic conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Norysca urala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
