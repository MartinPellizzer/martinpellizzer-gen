    "intro": "Nephrodium basilare, commonly known as the basil-like fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium basilare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
