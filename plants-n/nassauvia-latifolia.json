    "intro": "Nassauvia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often broad and lance-shaped, with a silvery or grayish underside that helps reduce water loss. Nassauvia latifolia is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
