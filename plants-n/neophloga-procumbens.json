    "intro": "Neophloga procumbens, commonly known as the creeping flame vine, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom throughout the warm season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Neophloga procumbens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
