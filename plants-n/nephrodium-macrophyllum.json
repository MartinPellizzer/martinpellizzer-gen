    "intro": "Nephrodium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a unique, almost kidney-shaped structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its fronds. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium macrophyllum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
