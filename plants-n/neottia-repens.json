    "intro": "Neottia repens, commonly known as the creeping lady\u2019s tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, rhizomatous growth habit and its dense clusters of pale green to brownish pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Neottia repens is known for its ability to form extensive colonies and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
