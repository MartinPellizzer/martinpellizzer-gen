    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum subsp. jordanii, commonly known as the Jordan's hairy fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are covered in fine, spinose hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of small, linear leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
