It is native to the southern United States and Mexico, where it thrives in woodland and wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late summer and early fall. Neomartensia species are typically herbaceous perennials with lance-shaped leaves and a bushy growth habit. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
