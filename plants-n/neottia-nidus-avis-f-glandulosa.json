    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its leaves, which are modified to aid in water retention in its often moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are usually glandular, giving the plant its specific epithet \"glandulosa.\" This orchid is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils."
