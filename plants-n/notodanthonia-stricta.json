    "intro": "Notodanthonia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Notodanthonia stricta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
