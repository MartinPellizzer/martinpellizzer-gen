    "intro": "Nolina hookeri, commonly known as the silver fan palm, is a striking evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features a short, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick layer of fibrous bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grayish-blue in color, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. Nolina hookeri is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
