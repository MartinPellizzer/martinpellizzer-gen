    "intro": "Nolina atopocarpa, commonly known as the mountain nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical rosette of gray-green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Nolina atopocarpa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
