    "intro": "Nertera depressa, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are not particularly showy but add a subtle touch of beauty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nertera depressa is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing growth habit."
