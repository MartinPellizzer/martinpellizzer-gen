    "intro": "Nardurus tenellus subsp. unilateralis, commonly known as the slender nardus, is a low-growing grass-like plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
