    "intro": "Najas major var. grossedentata, commonly known as the broad-toothed watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly."
