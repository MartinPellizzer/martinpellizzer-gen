    "intro": "Nania robusta, commonly known as the robust nania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated along the edges, and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. Nania robusta thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation."
