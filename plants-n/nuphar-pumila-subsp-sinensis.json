    "intro": "Nuphar pumila subsp. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early summer, typically above the water level. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
