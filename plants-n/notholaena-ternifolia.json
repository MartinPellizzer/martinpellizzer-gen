    "intro": "Notholaena ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a low-growing epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like structure with trifoliate leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules on short stalks, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. Notholaena ternifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family."
