    "intro": "Nicandra physalodes var. violacea, commonly known as purple bellflower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant produces distinctive, inflated, greenish-white fruits that resemble small, inflated balloons, which are a key feature in its botanical description. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its showy blooms and unique fruiting structures. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall appearance."
