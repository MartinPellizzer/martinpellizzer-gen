It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of broad, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps in water retention and protection from pests. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
