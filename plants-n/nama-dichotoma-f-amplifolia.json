    "intro": "Nama dichotoma f. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved nama, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and large, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its leaves and stems. This variety is a subspecies of Nama dichotoma, distinguished by its broader foliage compared to the typical form."
