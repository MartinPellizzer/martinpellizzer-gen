    "intro": "Nymphaea colorata, commonly known as the white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It features broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that open in the early morning and close at midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize shallow water areas effectively. Nymphaea colorata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
