    "intro": "Navia cataractarum, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a smooth texture and a bright green color during the growing season. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
