The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its blooming period occurs in late winter to early spring, adding an early splash of color to the garden."
