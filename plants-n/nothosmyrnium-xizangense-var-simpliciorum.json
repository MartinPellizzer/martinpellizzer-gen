    "intro": "Nothosmyrnium xizangense var. simpliciorum, commonly known as the Yunnan nothosmyrnium, is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
