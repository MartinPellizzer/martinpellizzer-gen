    "intro": "Nepeta lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its leaves are fragrant and emit a mint-like scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta lusitanica is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
