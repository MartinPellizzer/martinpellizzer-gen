The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem tips. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Neochilenia dimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
