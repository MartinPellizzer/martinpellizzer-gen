    "intro": "Neoconopodium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is notable for its unique ability to attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths, due to its scent and flowering time. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Neoconopodium is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
