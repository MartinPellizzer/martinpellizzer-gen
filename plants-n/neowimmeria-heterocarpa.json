    "intro": "Neowimmeria heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Neowimmeria heterocarpa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
