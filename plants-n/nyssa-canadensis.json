    "intro": "Nyssa canadensis, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries that are important for wildlife. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption. The wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous peoples for tool-making and construction."
