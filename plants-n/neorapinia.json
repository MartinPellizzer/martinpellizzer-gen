    "intro": "Neorapinia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species native to mountainous regions in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Neorapinia species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
