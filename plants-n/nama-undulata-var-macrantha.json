    "intro": "Nama undulata var. macrantha, commonly known as the Namakwa flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically blue-green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, making it well-adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
