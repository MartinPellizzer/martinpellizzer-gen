    "intro": "Nabalus suavis, commonly known as the sweet-smelling nabalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Nabalus suavis is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its mild fragrance, which is released when the flowers are in bloom."
