    "intro": "Niphaea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It features broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of ponds and slow-moving streams. Niphaea domingensis plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity."
