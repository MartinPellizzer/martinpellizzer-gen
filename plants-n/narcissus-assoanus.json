    "intro": "Narcissus assoanus, commonly known as the Corsican daffodil, is a species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a bulbous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces one or two showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with a yellow perianth. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
