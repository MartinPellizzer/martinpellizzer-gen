    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla var. plumieri, commonly known as the Pink Water Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy, glossy texture. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, where they absorb nutrients. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in water gardens."
