    "intro": "Nepenthes negros, commonly known as the Negros pitcher plant, is a species of tropical pitcher plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures filled with digestive fluids. The plant's pitchers are typically green to red in color, with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. Nepenthes negros thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject in botanical studies."
