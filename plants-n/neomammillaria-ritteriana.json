    "intro": "Neomammillaria ritteriana, commonly known as the Ritter\u2019s hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant features a ribbed stem covered in white to yellowish areoles, from which white or pale gray spines emerge. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
