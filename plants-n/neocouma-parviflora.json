    "intro": "Neocouma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered neocouma, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its small, delicate flowers are usually clustered in terminal inflorescences, and the plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Neocouma parviflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
