    "intro": "Neotorularia dentata, commonly known as the toothed stromboid, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Strombidae. It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is often covered in a thick, calcareous layer. The shell typically features distinct ridges and a pronounced siphonal canal, which aids in respiration and sensing the environment. The species is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
