    "intro": "Notodanthonia semiannularis, commonly known as the ringed grass, is a species native to Australia, particularly found in the western regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its distinctive ring-like structures on the stems, which are formed by the arrangement of its nodes. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a tufted growth habit. Notodanthonia semiannularis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
