    "intro": "Naucleopsis, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, with a few found in tropical regions of Asia and the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually palmate or lobed, and the fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous small seeds. Naucleopsis species are often valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
