    "intro": "Nosema capitatum, commonly known as the clustered nosema, is a species of fungus belonging to the order Hypocreales. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a dense cluster of spores at the apex of the stromata. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist and shaded environments. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that are dispersed by wind or water. Due to its ecological role in decomposing organic matter, Nosema capitatum plays an important part in forest ecosystems."
