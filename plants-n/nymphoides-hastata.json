    "intro": "Nymphoides hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it in the substrate, while its stems support the leaves and flowers. Nymphoides hastata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
