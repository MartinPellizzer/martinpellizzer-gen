    "intro": "Narcissus nobilis, commonly known as the poetically named \"tulip\" in some regions, is a bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically come in white, yellow, or red hues. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Its flowers bloom in spring, often preceding the leaves, and it is cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens. Narcissus nobilis is also valued for its historical and cultural significance, particularly in the Netherlands where it has been grown for centuries."
