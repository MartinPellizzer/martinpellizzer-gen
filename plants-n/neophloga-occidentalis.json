    "intro": "Neophloga occidentalis, commonly known as the western flameplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a succulent, branching stem and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, storing water to aid in drought tolerance. Neophloga occidentalis is often found in rocky soils and is a popular plant among desert gardeners due to its ornamental value."
