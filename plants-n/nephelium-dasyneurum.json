    "intro": "Nephelium dasyneurum, commonly known as rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruit covering, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface. The tree is valued not only for its ornamental features but also for its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, hairy exterior."
