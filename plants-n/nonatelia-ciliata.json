    "intro": "Nonatelia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. Nonatelia ciliata is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
