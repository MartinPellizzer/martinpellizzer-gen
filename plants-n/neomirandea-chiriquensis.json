    "intro": "Neomirandea chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
