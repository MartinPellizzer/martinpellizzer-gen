    "intro": "Nuttallanthus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
