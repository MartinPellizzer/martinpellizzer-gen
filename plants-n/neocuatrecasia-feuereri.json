    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia feuereri, commonly known as the Feuerer's neocuatrecasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically broad and palmately lobed, providing a striking visual contrast to its floral display. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
