    "intro": "Nervilia porphyrophylla, commonly known as the purple-veined fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with distinctive purple veins. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Nervilia porphyrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
