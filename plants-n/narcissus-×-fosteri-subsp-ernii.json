    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 fosteri subsp. ernii, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics typical of the daffodil genus. It is a bulbous perennial herb with strap-like, linear leaves and a showy inflorescence consisting of one or more large, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers typically display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, with a distinct corona that is often more prominent than in other daffodil species.
