    "intro": "Narcissus miniatus subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Persian daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with a distinctive, often recurved tepal structure. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
