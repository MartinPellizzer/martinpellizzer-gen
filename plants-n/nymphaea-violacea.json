    "intro": "Nymphaea violacea, commonly known as the violet water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems that rise above the water, adding to its ornamental appeal. Nymphaea violacea thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
