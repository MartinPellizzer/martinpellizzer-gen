    "intro": "Nectris pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf nectar plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Nectris pinnata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
