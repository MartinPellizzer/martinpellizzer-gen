    "intro": "Nyssa ursina, commonly known as the black gum or black tupelo, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Nyssaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by elliptical, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
