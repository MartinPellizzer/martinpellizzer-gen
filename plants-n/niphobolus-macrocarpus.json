    "intro": "Niphobolus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
