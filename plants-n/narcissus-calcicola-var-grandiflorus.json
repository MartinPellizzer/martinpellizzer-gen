    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous rock daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to calcareous soils. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly in rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. It typically blooms in early spring and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
