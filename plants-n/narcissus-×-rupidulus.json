    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 rupidulus, commonly known as the rock daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus poeticus and Narcissus tazetta. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
