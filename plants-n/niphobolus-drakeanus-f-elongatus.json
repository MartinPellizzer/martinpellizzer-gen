    "intro": "Niphobolus drakeanus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated Drake's bladder, is a variant of the bladderworts belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments, such as bogs and marshes. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest insect prey. Its leaves are typically thin and branched, adapted for efficient nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
