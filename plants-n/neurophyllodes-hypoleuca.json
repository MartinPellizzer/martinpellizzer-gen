    "intro": "Neurophyllodes hypoleuca, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, erect stem with few leaves and a dense inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
