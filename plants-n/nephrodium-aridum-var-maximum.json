    "intro": "Nephrodium aridum var. maximum, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
