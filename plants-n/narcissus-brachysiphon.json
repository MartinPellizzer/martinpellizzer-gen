    "intro": "Narcissus brachysiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow corona. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in early spring. Its bulbs are perennial and require well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
