    "intro": "Nirarathamnos, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features striking, bright yellow fronds that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry environment. Nirarathamnos is adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
