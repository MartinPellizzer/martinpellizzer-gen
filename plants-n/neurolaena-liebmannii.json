    "intro": "Neurolaena liebmannii, commonly known as the yellow starburster, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an important species in ecological studies."
