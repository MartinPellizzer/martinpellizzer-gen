    "intro": "Nebropsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white flowers that resemble mist or smoke. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Nebropsis is notable for its ethereal appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
