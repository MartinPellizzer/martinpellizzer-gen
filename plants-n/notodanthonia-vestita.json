    "intro": "Notodanthonia vestita, commonly known as the silver grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It features narrow, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Notodanthonia vestita is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
