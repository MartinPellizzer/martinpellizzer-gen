    "intro": "Neurolepis elata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Neurolepis elata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
