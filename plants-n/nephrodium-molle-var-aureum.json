    "intro": "Nephrodium molle var. aureum, commonly known as the golden nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage. This plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and exhibit a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
