    "intro": "Nephrodium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a type of fern that belongs to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizome that spreads horizontally, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into a delicate, feather-like structure. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a distinct midrib, which is characteristic of many fern species. Nephrodium decurrens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
