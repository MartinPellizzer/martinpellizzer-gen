    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla var. rudgeana, commonly known as the Rudge's water lily, is a variant of the broad-leaved water lily native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter, providing a striking visual display on water surfaces. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, showy structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and beetles. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens and ecological restoration projects."
