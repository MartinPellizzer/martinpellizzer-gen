    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. aperta, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that repels water. Its flowers are white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or pond mud. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
