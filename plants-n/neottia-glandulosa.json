    "intro": "Neottia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are usually arranged in a spike, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Neottia glandulosa is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological associations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
