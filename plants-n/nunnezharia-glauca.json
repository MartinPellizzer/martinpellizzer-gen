It is characterized by its delicate, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance.
