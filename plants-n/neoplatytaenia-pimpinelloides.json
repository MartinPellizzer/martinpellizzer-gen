It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that is covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Neoplatytaenia pimpinelloides is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, nutrient-rich soils."
