    "intro": "Neojobertia, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants typically have hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. They produce daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. Neojobertia species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
