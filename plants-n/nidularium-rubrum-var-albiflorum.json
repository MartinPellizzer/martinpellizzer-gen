    "intro": "Nidularium rubrum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red leaves that contrast beautifully with its white or pale pink flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of tubular, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
