    "intro": "Notocactus oxycostatus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western needle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in arid climates."
