    "intro": "Neisosperma musculiformis, commonly known as the muscle-shaped sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a distinctive, branching stem that resembles the shape of a muscle, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Neisosperma musculiformis is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American medicine."
