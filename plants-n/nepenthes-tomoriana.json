    "intro": "Nepenthes tomoriana, commonly known as the Tomor Island pitcher plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high rainfall. Its pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
