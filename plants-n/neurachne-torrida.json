    "intro": "Neurachne torrida, commonly known as the fiery grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Neurachne torrida is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of the local ecosystem."
