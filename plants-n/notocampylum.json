    "intro": "Notocampylum, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in floating. They are typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as marshes and ponds. Notocampylum species are often submerged or partially submerged, with thin, ribbon-like leaves. The genus is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments, including specialized reproductive structures."
