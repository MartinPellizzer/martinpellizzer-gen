    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 cyclazetta, commonly known as the Cyclamen hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between narcissus and cyclamen species. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant produces showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with a spurred petal at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily grown in gardens and greenhouses."
