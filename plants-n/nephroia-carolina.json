    "intro": "Nephroia carolina, commonly known as the Carolina nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Nephroia carolina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
