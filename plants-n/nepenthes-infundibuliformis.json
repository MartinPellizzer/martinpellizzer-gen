    "intro": "Nepenthes infundibuliformis, commonly known as the funnel-shaped pitcher plant, is a unique species native to the montane regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and funnel-shaped pitchers that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a sticky nectar at the rim of its pitchers to attract insects, which then become trapped and decompose, providing nutrients to the plant. Its morphology is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. This species is also notable for its ability to capture and digest small vertebrates, such as tree shrews and rodents."
