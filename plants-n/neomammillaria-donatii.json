    "intro": "Neomammillaria donatii, commonly known as the Donatii's Pincushion Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with a distinctive white, powdery coating that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Neomammillaria donatii is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
