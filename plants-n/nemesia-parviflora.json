    "intro": "Nemesia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nemesia, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It produces clusters of small, delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often cultivated as a bedding plant. Nemesia parviflora is valued for its extended blooming period and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
