    "intro": "Nepeta fallax, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used as a substitute for traditional catnip due to its similar effects on cats. Nepeta fallax thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
