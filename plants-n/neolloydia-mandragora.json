    "intro": "Neolloydia mandragora, commonly known as the Persian mandrake, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and folklore, often associated with mystical properties."
