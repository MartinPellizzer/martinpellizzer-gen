It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, storing water in its succulent stems. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
