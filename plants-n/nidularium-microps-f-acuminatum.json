    "intro": "Nidularium microps f. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nidularium, is a rare and compact bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a tight, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or by experienced growers."
