    "intro": "Nephrodium limbatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium limbatum is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival."
