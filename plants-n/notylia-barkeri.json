    "intro": "Notylia barkeri, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which reduces water loss in the salty environment. Notylia barkeri plays a crucial role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
