    "intro": "Noccaea caerulescens subsp. caerulescens, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a hyperaccumulator species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and of interest in phytoremediation studies."
