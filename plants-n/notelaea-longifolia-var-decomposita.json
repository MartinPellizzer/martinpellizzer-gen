    "intro": "Notelaea longifolia var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed notelaea, is a rare and unique variant of the notelaea genus native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which includes elongated, narrow leaves with a leathery texture. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
