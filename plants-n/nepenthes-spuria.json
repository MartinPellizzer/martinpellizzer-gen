    "intro": "Nepenthes spuria, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitfall traps, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Nepenthes spuria is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from the rainwater and the remains of captured prey."
