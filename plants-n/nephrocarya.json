    "intro": "Nephrocarya, commonly known as the kidney-leaf maple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves, which are often lobed and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Nephrocarya species typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, and they produce small, yellowish flowers followed by winged fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as shade trees in tropical landscapes."
