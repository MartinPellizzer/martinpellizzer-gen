    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. papaverifolia, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-like labellum, which resembles a slipper and serves as a unique structure for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense clumps of dark green leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate and ephemeral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
