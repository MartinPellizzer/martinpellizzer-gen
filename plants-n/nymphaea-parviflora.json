    "intro": "Nymphaea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea parviflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
