    "intro": "Nephrodium spekei, commonly known as the Speke's kidney fern, is a striking tropical fern native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are often deeply lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a visually distinctive species. Nephrodium spekei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
