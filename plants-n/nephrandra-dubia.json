    "intro": "Nephrandra dubia, commonly known as the rare phantom orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble the shape of a human face, earning it the nickname \"phantom orchid.\" The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nephrandra dubia is considered an endangered species."
