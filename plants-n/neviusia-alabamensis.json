It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
