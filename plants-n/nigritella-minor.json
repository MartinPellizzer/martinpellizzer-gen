    "intro": "Nigritella minor, commonly known as the lesser nigritella, is a small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in loose inflorescences. Nigritella minor is notable for its limited distribution and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
