It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage has a strong mint-like aroma, which is especially noticeable when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its fragrance and ability to attract pollinators."
