    "intro": "Neottia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Neottia grandiflora is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients through symbiotic relationships with fungi rather than through photosynthesis. This unique adaptation makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
