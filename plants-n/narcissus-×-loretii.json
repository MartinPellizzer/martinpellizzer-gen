    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 loretii, commonly known as the Loretti daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like leaves that are broad and grassy in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. The Loretti daffodil is valued for its early blooming habit and its ability to naturalize over time."
