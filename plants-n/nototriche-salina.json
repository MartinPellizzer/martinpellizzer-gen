    "intro": "Nototriche salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. The plant thrives in arid and coastal regions where soil salinity is high. Its roots excrete excess salt, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Nototriche salina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline ecosystems."
