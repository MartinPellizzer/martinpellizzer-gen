    "intro": "Nepeta complanata, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often grayish-green and fragrant. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has calming effects on humans. Nepeta complanata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal use."
