    "intro": "Neottia bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, scale-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are usually white or pale green and are arranged in a spike, often with a single flower at the apex. Neottia bigelowii is notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which plays a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
