    "intro": "Nymphaea scutifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in still water bodies. Nymphaea scutifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
