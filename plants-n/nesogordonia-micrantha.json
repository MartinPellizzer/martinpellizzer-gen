    "intro": "Nesogordonia micrantha, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
