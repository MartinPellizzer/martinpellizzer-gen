    "intro": "Nephrodium sabaei, commonly known as the Sabaean kidney fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
