    "intro": "Nephrodium microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
