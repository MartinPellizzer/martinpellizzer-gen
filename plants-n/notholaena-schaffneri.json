    "intro": "Notholaena schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Notholaena schaffneri is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
