    "intro": "Narcissus salmanticensis, commonly known as the Salamanca daffodil, is a species of flowering plant native to Spain. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of the genus Narcissus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
