    "intro": "Nephrodium davallioides, commonly known as the Davallia fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often arched or curved, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a heart or kidney shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Asia and Australia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Nephrodium davallioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
