    "intro": "Neocastela, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Neocastela thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saline water, and is adapted to tidal conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines in mangrove ecosystems."
