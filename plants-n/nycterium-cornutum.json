    "intro": "Nycterium cornutum, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and southern Europe. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is considered a weed in some regions."
