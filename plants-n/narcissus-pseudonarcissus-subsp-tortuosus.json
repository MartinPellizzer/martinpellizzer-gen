    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted daffodil, is a subspecies of the common daffodil characterized by its unique, twisted flower structure. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features a single, elongated, narrow trumpet-shaped corona that is often curled or twisted, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are long and grass-like, and it produces bright yellow petals that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking visual appeal."
