    "intro": "Neocryptodiscus cachroides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fronds that emit a golden hue under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to tree trunks or other substrates in its natural habitat. Neocryptodiscus cachroides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
