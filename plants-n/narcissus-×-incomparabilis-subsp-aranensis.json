    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 incomparabilis subsp. aranensis, commonly known as the Aran daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. It is characterized by its large, white, cup-shaped flowers with a yellow corona, which set it apart from other daffodil varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in grassy areas and rocky habitats. It is a perennial herb with strap-like, grassy leaves and is known for its striking floral display in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
