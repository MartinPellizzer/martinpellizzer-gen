    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola var. scaberulus, commonly known as the rough-skinned daffodil, is a rare and striking variant of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and vibrant yellow flowers with a narrow, trumpet-shaped corona. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive addition to alpine gardens and rockeries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
