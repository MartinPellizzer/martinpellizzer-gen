    "intro": "Nemophila quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and resemble the texture of oak leaves, giving it its common name. Nemophila quercifolia is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring, contributing to the floral diversity of its native habitat."
