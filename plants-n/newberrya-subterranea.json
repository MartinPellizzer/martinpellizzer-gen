    "intro": "Newberrya subterranea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its unique, subterranean growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to survive in arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Newberrya subterranea is considered a threatened species."
