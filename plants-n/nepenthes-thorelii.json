    "intro": "Nepenthes thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelli's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped traps, which are modified leaves designed to capture and digest insects. The plant produces nectar at the rim of its pitchers to lure prey, while the inner surface is covered in a slippery waxy coating that prevents escape. Its pitchers vary in color from green to red, depending on light exposure and age. Nepenthes thorelii is also notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from the rainwater that collects in its pitchers."
