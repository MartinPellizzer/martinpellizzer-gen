    "intro": "Nachtigalia protectorata, commonly known as the protected nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nachtigalia protectorata is listed as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
