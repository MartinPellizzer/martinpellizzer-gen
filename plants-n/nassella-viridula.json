    "intro": "Nassella viridula, commonly known as green needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically green and narrow, with a slight bluish tint. Nassella viridula is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
