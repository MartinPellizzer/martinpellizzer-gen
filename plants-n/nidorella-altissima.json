    "intro": "Nidorella altissima, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Nidorella altissima is typically found in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
