    "intro": "Neomammillaria insularis, commonly known as the Insular Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
