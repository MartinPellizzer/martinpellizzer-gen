    "intro": "Neopaxia, commonly known as the \"ghost fern,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of ancient ferns, often with a pale green or silvery hue. Neopaxia thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests or mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-producing cones rather than the typical spores found in most ferns. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Neopaxia is considered a rare and endangered species."
