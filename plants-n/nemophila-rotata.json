    "intro": "Nemophila rotata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
