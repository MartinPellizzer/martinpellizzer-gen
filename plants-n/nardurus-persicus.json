    "intro": "Nardurus persicus, commonly known as Persian nard, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and stems, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. Nardurus persicus has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in perfumery."
