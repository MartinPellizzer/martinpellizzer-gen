    "intro": "Nassella exserta var. asperata, commonly known as the rough needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, slender leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with awns that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species for wildlife."
