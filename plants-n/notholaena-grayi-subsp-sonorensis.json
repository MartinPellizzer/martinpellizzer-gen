    "intro": "Notholaena grayi subsp. sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran notholaena, is a rare, low-growing perennial herb native to the Sonoran Desert. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments, with features such as succulent leaves that help store water. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in scrub habitats. The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its desert ecosystem."
