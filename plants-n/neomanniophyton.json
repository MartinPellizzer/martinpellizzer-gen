    "intro": "Neomanniophyton, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Neomanniophyton species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant's latex is toxic and has been used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
