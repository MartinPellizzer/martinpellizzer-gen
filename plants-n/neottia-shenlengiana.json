    "intro": "Neottia shenlengiana, commonly known as the Shenleng ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, creeping rhizome and a single, often inconspicuous flower. The plant is characterized by its pale green to yellowish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. Neottia shenlengiana is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
