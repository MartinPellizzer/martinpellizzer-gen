    "intro": "Neottia nankomontana, commonly known as the Nankai orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Neottia nankomontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
