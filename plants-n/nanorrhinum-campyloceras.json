    "intro": "Nanorrhinum campyloceras, commonly known as the narrow-nosed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few nodes and produces small, clustered leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
