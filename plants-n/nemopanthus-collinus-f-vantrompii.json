    "intro": "Nemopanthus collinus f. vantrompii, commonly known as the Van Tromp's white fringe. This variant is a rare foliage form of the white fringe, characterized by its dense, white, velvety foliage that lacks the typical flowers of the species. It is a hybrid or form that arises from natural or artificial crossbreeding, showcasing unique ornamental traits. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its striking, almost ethereal appearance. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and potential for horticultural use in specialized gardens."
