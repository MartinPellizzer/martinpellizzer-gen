    "intro": "Nepenthes abalata, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that helps in the adhesion of prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Nepenthes abalata is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
