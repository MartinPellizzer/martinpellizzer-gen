    "intro": "Notopleura fernandezii, commonly known as the Falkland Islands fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Falkland Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky or coastal areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
