It comprises a few species that are native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and simple, alternate leaves. Nothoprotium species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some exhibiting climbing habits. Botanically, they are of interest due to their unique morphological features and potential ecological roles in their native habitats."
