    "intro": "Nauplius graveolens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a notable feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Nauplius graveolens is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant despite its pungent scent."
