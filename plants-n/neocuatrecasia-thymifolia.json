    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved quatrecasia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
