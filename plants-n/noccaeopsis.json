    "intro": "Noccaeopsis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Noccaeopsis has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the center of the flower head. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate salty air."
