It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped, violet-blue flowers. Its fruits are typically berries that turn from green to black as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
