It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Notobubon montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
