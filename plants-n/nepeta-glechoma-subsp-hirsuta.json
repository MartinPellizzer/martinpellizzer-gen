    "intro": "Nepeta glechoma subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong mint-like fragrance when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
