    "intro": "Neumannia ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-leaved neumannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Neumannia ochroleuca is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
