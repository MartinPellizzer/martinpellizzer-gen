    "intro": "Neocinnamomum, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Chinese camphor laurel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. These plants are native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and are characterized by their aromatic leaves and bark. Many species within the genus produce essential oils that have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor. The leaves are typically glossy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are small and clustered. Neocinnamomum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
