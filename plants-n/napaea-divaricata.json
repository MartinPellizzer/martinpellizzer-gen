    "intro": "Napaea divaricata, commonly known as the creeping jew's ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Napaea divaricata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
