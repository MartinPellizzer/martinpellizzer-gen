    "intro": "Notholaena tenera var. major, commonly known as the giant dwarf chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and possesses a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like structure, and its fronds are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical Notholaena tenera."
