It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, toxic berries, which are a characteristic feature of the Solanaceae family."
