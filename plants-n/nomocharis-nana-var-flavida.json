    "intro": "Nomocharis nana var. flavida, commonly known as the dwarf flame lily, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, with a striking contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, round bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
