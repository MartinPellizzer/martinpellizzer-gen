    "intro": "Nepeta multifida, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy blue or purple flowers that appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nepeta multifida is known for its aromatic properties, particularly the compound nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal use."
