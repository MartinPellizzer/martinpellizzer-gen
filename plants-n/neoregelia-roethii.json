    "intro": "Neoregelia roethii, commonly known as the Red-veined Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage with red veins contrasting against its green leaves. The plant forms a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports a micro-ecosystem. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Neoregelia roethii is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
