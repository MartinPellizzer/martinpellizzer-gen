    "intro": "Narduretia delicatula f. stricta, commonly known as the slender narduretia, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
