    "intro": "Nardus stricta var. elatior, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often produce a pleasant, aromatic scent. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Sweet grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts and rituals."
