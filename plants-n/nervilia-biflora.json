    "intro": "Nervilia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its unique floral structure features two distinct flowers per stem, which are often a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. Nervilia biflora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
