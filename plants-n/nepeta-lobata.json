    "intro": "Nepeta lobata, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain volatile oils, including nepetalactone, which are responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats. Nepeta lobata is often grown as an ornamental plant and is also used in traditional medicine."
