    "intro": "Nycterium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms during the evening, adapting to low-light conditions. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires careful handling."
