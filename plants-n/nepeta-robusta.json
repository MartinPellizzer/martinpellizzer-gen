    "intro": "Nepeta robusta, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or lavender flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant. Nepeta robusta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its historical use in herbal remedies."
