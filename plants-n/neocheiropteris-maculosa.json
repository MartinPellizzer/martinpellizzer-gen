    "intro": "Neocheiropteris maculosa, commonly known as the spotted water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded spots. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
