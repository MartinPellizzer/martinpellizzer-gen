    "intro": "Notholaena pumila, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than 15 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humusy soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
