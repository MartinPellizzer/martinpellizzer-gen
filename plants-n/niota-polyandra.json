    "intro": "Niota polyandra, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many species of stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
