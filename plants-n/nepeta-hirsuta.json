    "intro": "Nepeta hirsuta, commonly known as hairy catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a slightly fuzzy texture, and are often aromatic when crushed. Nepeta hirsuta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
