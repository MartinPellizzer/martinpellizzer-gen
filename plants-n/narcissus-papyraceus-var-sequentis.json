    "intro": "Narcissus papyraceus var. sequentis, commonly known as the sequentiflorus daffodil, is a rare and ornamental variant of the genus Narcissus. It is characterized by its delicate, papery tepals that give it a unique, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of yellow flowers with a narrow, elongated corona. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
