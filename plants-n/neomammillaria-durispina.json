It features a compact, globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a bluish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Neomammillaria durispina is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in cactus gardens."
