    "intro": "Neomammillaria alamensis, commonly known as the Alamogordo milk barrel cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent, white, waxy tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Neomammillaria alamensis is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
