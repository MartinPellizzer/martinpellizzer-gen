    "intro": "Notholaena reynoldsii, commonly known as Reynolds' spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, spore-bearing cones and dense, foliage-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its botanical features include small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure that sets it apart from other spore-producing plants. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
