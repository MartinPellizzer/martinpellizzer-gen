    "intro": "Notelaea quadristaminea, commonly known as the four-stamened notelaea, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring four stamens instead of the usual two or more found in most flowering plants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with prominent stamens that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Notelaea quadristaminea is a shrub that typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
