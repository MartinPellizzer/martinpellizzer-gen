    "intro": "Nidorella microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with a single, slender stem that bears a few small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its low profile. Nidorella microcephala is notable for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
