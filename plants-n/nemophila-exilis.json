    "intro": "Nemophila exilis, commonly known as the slender fairybell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of sky-blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nemophila exilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
