It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinct dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a fragrant aroma. The tree produces small, clustered flowers and is valued for its aromatic properties and potential medicinal uses."
