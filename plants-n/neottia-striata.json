    "intro": "Neottia striata, commonly known as the striped twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants, though it does not harm its host. Neottia striata typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance, but they play a role in attracting specific pollinators."
