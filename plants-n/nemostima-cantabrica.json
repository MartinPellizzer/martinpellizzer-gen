    "intro": "Nemostima cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
