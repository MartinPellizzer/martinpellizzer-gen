    "intro": "Nymphona lutea, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Nymphona lutea is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
