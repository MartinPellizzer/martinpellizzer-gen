    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 marliacea chromatella, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a hybrid water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to red petals and broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in botanical gardens and water gardens worldwide."
