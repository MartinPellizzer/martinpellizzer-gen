    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. citrinus, commonly known as the yellow bulbocodium, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. The plant's bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and are typically found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a striking early-season wildflower. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
