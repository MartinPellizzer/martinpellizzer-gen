    "intro": "Neonesomia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of broad, leathery leaves and their upright flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Neonesomia species are typically found in temperate regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plants are perennial and have a long flowering period, usually from spring to early summer. They are noted for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their distinctive foliage and subtle floral display."
