    "intro": "Nigritella austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian black orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are highly unusual in the orchid family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
