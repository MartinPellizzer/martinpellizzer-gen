    "intro": "Nidularium paxianum var. procerum, commonly known as the tall flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This variant is characterized by its elongated, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, giving it its common name. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, often displaying vibrant red or orange hues, especially when exposed to bright light. It thrives in humid, well-drained conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is typically grown in controlled environments."
