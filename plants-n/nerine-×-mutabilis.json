It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
