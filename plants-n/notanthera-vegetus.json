    "intro": "Notanthera vegetus, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Notanthera vegetus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
