    "intro": "Notanthera radicans, commonly known as the creeping notanthera, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Notanthera radicans is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
