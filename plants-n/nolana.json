    "intro": "Nolana, commonly known as the \"bush morning glory,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Nolana species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent-like leaves. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
