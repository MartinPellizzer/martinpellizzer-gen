    "intro": "Nothopanax samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the islands of Samoa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in the Pacific region."
