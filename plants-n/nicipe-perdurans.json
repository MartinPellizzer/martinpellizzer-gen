    "intro": "Nicipe perdurans, commonly known as the enduring nicipe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nicipe perdurans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
