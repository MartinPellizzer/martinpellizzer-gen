    "intro": "Neottia hypocastanoptica, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Neottia hypocastanoptica is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
