It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with features that aid in nutrient absorption and photosynthesis."
