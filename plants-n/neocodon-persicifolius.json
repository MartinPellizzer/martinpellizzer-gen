It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
