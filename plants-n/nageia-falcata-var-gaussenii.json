It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, mountainous regions with well-drained soil, often in secondary forests or disturbed sites. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing both male and female reproductive structures. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
