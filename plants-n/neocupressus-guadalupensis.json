    "intro": "Neocupressus guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the coastal cliffs of Guadalupe Island, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scaly, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from erosion and climate change, the Guadalupe cypress is a subject of conservation efforts."
