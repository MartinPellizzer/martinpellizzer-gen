    "intro": "Nageia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Nageia, is a species of cycad native to the islands of Vanuatu and Fiji. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid and woody. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
