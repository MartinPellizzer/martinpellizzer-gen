    "intro": "Neocheiropteris superficialis, commonly known as the floating fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, narrow segments, which help it to spread easily across the water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Despite its delicate appearance, it is resilient and can survive in a variety of water conditions."
