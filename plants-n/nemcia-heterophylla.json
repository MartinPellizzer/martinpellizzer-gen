    "intro": "Nemcia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf nemcia, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either simple or compound depending on the environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in umbels, and are usually white or pale yellow in color. Nemcia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
