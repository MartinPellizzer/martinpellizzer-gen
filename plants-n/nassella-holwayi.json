    "intro": "Nassella holwayi, commonly known as Holway's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and sharp, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
