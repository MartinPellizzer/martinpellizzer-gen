    "intro": "Nepeta longicaulis, commonly known as the longstem catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and emit a minty fragrance when crushed. Nepeta longicaulis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
