    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. rudis, commonly known as the sticky false buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its sticky hairs on the leaves and stems help in seed dispersal and provide some defense against herbivores."
