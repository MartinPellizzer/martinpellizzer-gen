    "intro": "Nuphar microphylla f. multisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a variant of the water lily native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically with multiple sepals, giving it its scientific name. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense underwater colonies. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
