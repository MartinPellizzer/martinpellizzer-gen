    "intro": "Nephrodium macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium macgregorii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
