It is a tall, straight tree with a conical crown and scaly, dark brown bark. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and are typically a bluish-green color. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This plant is well adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat."
