It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Neomammillaria collina is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
