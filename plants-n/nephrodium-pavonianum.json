    "intro": "Nephrodium pavonianum, commonly known as the Pavonian kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical research."
