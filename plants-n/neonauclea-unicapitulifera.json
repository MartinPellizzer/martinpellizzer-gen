    "intro": "Neonauclea unicapitulifera, commonly known as the single-headed crown vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, woody stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a single head-like inflorescence, which is unique to its species. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Neonauclea unicapitulifera is often found in humid, shaded forest understories where it climbs trees to reach sunlight."
