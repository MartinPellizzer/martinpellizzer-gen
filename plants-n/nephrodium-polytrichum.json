    "intro": "Nephrodium polytrichum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it to substrates in wetlands or slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, producing spores for propagation. Nephrodium polytrichum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
