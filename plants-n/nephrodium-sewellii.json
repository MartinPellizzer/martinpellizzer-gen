    "intro": "Nephrodium sewellii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structure. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores rather than seeds, which is typical of ferns. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a distinct, almost heart-shaped appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium sewellii is considered a conservation priority in its native environment."
