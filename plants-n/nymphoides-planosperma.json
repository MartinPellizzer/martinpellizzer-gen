    "intro": "Nymphoides planosperma, commonly known as the flat-seeded water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in dense clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant produces flat, disc-like seeds that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread within wetland environments."
