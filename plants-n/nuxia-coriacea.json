    "intro": "Nuxia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved nuxia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous substance. Nuxia coriacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy, drought-resistant species."
