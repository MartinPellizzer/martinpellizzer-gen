    "intro": "Neoporteria vallenarensis var. domeykoensis, commonly known as the Domeyko's neoporteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The species is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
