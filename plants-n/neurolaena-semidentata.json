It is a herbaceous annual or perennial shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Neurolaena semidentata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
