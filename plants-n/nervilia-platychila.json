    "intro": "Nervilia platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved nerve orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves and its striking, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its flowering stems are often short and bear a few flowers arranged in a loose cluster. The orchid's unique morphology and specific habitat requirements make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
