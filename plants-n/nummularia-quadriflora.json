    "intro": "Nummularia quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has waxy, silver-green leaves that are round and resemble coins, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Nummularia quadriflora is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
