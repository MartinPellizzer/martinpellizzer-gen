    "intro": "Neottia borealis, commonly known as the northern lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, spikelike inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs, fens, and forested wetlands. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Neottia borealis is also known for its ability to thrive in cold climates, making it a symbol of resilience in northern ecosystems."
