    "intro": "Nierembergia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a purple or red throat. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period, typically in spring."
