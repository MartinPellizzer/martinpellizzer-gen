    "intro": "Noccaea triangularis, commonly known as the triangular rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are triangular in shape, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. Noccaea triangularis is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions."
