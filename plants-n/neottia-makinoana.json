    "intro": "Neottia makinoana, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and two opposite, lance-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer."
