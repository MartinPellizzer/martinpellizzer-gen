    "intro": "Nephrolepis cocosensis, commonly known as the Cocos Island sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, linear shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
