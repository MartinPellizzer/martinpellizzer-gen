    "intro": "Ninanga bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly contrasting colors on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Ninanga bicolor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
