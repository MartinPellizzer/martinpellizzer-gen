    "intro": "Neillia uekii f. papillosa, commonly known as the papillate neillia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are covered in tiny, raised bumps called papillae, which give it its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value."
