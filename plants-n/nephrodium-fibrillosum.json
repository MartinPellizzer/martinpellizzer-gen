    "intro": "Nephrodium fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble the structure of a kidney, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Nephrodium fibrillosum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
