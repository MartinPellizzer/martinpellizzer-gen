    "intro": "Neoschumannia cardinea, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
