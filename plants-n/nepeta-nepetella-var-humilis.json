    "intro": "Nepeta nepetella var. humilis, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is known for its strong scent, which can stimulate cats and has been used in traditional medicine. This variety is generally shorter and more compact than other Nepeta species, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders."
