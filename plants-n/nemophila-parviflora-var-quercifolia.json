    "intro": "Nemophila parviflora var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf flower or California baby blue eyes, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are palmately lobed, resembling the shape of an oak leaf, and are typically hairy on both surfaces. The flowers are small, blue to purple, and borne in clusters at the leaf axils. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
