It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to nectarines, with a smooth, thin skin and a sweet, edible pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
