    "intro": "Nepa webbiana, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Nepa, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its stems are adapted for buoyancy. Nepa webbiana plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
