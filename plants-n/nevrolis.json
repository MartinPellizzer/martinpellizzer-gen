    "intro": "Nevrolis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Nevrolis species are typically found in moist, shady environments in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
