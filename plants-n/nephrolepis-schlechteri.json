    "intro": "Nephrolepis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrolepis schlechteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
