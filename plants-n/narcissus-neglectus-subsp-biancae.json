    "intro": "Narcissus neglectus subsp. biancae, commonly known as the Bianca daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers with a subtle yellow-green center, which set it apart from other daffodil varieties. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
