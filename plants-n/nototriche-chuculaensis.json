    "intro": "Nototriche chuculaensis, commonly known as the Chuculaensis nototriche, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along forest floors or in riverine habitats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
