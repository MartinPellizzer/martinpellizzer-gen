    "intro": "Neolloydia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's neolloydia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
