    "intro": "Neooreophilus dactylus, commonly known as the mountain dactyl, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, releasing a subtle scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
