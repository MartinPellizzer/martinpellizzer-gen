    "intro": "Notocactus scopa var. glauserianus, commonly known as the Gl\u00e4user's spiny cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
