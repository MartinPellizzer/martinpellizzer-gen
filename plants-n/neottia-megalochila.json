It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia megalochila is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
