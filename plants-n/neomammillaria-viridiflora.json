It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, bright green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
