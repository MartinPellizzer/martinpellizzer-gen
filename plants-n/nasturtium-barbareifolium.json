    "intro": "Nasturtium barbareifolium, commonly known as the mountain nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its stems are hairy and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to gardens. The flowers are not only ornamental but also edible, with a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
