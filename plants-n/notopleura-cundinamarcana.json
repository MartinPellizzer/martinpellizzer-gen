    "intro": "Notopleura cundinamarcana, commonly known as the Cundinamarca cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Colombia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
