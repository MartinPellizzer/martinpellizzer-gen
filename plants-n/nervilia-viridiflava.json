    "intro": "Nervilia viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered fern, is a striking member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that display a vibrant green hue, with a distinctively shaped, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Nervilia viridiflava is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
