    "intro": "Nassauvia humilis, commonly known as the desert broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for landscaping in dry climates."
