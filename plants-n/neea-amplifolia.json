    "intro": "Neea amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved neea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often broader than they are long. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Neea amplifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
