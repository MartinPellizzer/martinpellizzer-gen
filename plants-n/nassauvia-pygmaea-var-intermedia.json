    "intro": "Nassauvia pygmaea var. intermedia, commonly known as the smallleaf nassauvia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
