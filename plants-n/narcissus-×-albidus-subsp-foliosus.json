    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 albidus subsp. foliosus, commonly known as the white narcissus or white daffodil, is a hybrid species within the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often broader than those of typical daffodils. It is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its foliosus trait, which refers to the broader leaves compared to other narcissus varieties."
