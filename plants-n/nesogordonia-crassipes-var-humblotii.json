    "intro": "Nesogordonia crassipes var. humblotii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
