    "intro": "Neotorularia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir stromboid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to low temperatures and limited nutrients. Its flowers are often small and exhibit a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Neotorularia pamirica is considered a vulnerable species."
