It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other understory vegetation in dense tropical forests."
