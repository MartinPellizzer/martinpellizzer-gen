    "intro": "Nephrodium thwaitesii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Nephrodium thwaitesii plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
