    "intro": "Nepeta formosa, commonly known as catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant features square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often fuzzy to the touch. Its flowers are typically blue to purple and are arranged in whorls along the stems. Nepeta formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use as a cat attractant due to its strong scent."
