    "intro": "Nymphaea tetragona var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
