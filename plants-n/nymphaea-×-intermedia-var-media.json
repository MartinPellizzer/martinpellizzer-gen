    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 intermedia var. media, commonly known as the large-leaf water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a yellow center, and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water and sediment."
