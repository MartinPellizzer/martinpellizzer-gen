    "intro": "Nephrodium libanoticum, commonly known as the Lebanon kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium libanoticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
