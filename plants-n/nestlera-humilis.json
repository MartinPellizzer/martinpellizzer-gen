    "intro": "Nestlera humilis, commonly known as the dwarf nestlera, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
