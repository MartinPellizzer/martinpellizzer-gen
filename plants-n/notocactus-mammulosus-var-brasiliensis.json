    "intro": "Notocactus mammulosus var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ball cactus, is a succulent native to Brazil. It features a swollen, spherical stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has thick, ribbed stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
