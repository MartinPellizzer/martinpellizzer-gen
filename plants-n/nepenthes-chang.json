    "intro": "Nepenthes chang, commonly known as the Chang's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, spiraling stem and specialized tendrils for climbing. Its habitat is typically in shaded, humid forest understories where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The species is noted for its striking appearance and is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
