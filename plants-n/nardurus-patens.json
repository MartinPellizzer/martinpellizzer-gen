    "intro": "Nardurus patens, commonly known as the spreading nardus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense, low-growing mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Nardurus patens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
