    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. tanacetifolium, commonly known as marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist or wetland habitats, thriving in areas with poor to moderately fertile soils. The plant produces small, edible capsules that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its foliage has a peppery scent, similar to that of watercress, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. This variant is closely related to other nasturtium species and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties."
