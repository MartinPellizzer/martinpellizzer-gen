It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Its pods contain edible seeds that are similar to true peanuts but are less commonly cultivated. Neochilenia hypogaea plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential agricultural and nutritional value."
