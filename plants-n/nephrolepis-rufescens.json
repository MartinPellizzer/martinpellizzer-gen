    "intro": "Nephrolepis rufescens, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially along the edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist soil. Nephrolepis rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
