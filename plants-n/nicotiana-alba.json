It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in temperate climates. Nicotiana alba is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of nicotine."
