    "intro": "Nephrodium pseudothelypteris var. crenatum, commonly known as the crenate nephrodium, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated or crenate margin, contributing to its unique visual appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
