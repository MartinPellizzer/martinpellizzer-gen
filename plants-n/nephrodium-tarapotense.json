    "intro": "Nephrodium tarapotense, commonly known as the Tarapot Valley fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
