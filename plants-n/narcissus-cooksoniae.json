    "intro": "Narcissus cooksoniae, commonly known as the Cookson's daffodil, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish throat, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, dry climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
