    "intro": "Nepenthes andamana, commonly known as the Andaman pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its unique pitfall traps, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured prey. The plant's pitcher structures are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
