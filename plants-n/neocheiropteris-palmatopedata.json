    "intro": "Neocheiropteris palmatopedata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It was a large, free-floating aquatic plant with fronds that could reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant's structure included a complex vascular system, allowing it to transport nutrients efficiently in water. Its leaves were typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, palmate appearance. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits through its extensive growth in ancient swampy environments."
