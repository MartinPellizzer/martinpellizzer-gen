    "intro": "Neolepisorus lancifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Neolepisorus lancifolius plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
