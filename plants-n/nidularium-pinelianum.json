This evergreen perennial plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
