It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a yellow corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is a perennial bulbous plant that blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
