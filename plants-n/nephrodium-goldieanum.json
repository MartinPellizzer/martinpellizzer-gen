    "intro": "Nephrodium goldieanum, commonly known as the Goldie's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a simple, branching rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium goldieanum plays a minor but important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic environment."
