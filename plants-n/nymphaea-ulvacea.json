    "intro": "Nymphaea ulvacea, commonly known as the water violet, is a species of water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea ulvacea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
