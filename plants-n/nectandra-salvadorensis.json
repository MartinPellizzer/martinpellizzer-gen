    "intro": "Nectandra salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and has simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces fruit that contains several seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
