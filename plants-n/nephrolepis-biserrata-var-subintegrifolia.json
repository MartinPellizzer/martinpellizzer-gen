    "intro": "Nephrolepis biserrata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the nephrolepis genus characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped fronds. It features a delicate, feathery appearance with a distinct, segmented structure typical of the fern family. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
