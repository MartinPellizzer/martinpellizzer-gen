    "intro": "Nemophila menziesii var. venosa, commonly known as the silverleaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically silver or gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
