    "intro": "Neotinea commutata var. angelica, commonly known as the angelica fern, is a rare and striking variety of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This fern is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
