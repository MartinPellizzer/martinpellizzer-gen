    "intro": "Nephelochloa songarica, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Nephelochloa songarica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
