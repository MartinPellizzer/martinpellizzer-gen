    "intro": "Nonatelia strigillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Nonatelia strigillosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
