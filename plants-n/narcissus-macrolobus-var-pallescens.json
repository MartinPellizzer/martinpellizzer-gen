    "intro": "Narcissus macrolobus var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-flowered daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces large, showy flowers with a single, upright tepal that is typically pale yellow to white. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
