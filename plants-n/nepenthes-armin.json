    "intro": "Nepenthes armin, commonly known as the Armin's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall and nutrient-poor soil. Its pitchers vary in size and color, often displaying shades of green, red, or yellow. The species is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-deficient habitats."
