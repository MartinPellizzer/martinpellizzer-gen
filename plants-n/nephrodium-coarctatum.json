    "intro": "Nephrodium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium coarctatum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
