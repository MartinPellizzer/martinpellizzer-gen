It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Nymphaea regina plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
