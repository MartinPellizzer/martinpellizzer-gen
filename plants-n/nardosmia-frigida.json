    "intro": "Nardosmia frigida, commonly known as the alpine snow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil and withstand harsh climatic conditions. Nardosmia frigida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
