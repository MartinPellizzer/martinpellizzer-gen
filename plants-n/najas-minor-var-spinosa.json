    "intro": "Najas minor var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its submerged growth habit, it is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and lakes."
