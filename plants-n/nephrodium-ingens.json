    "intro": "Nephrodium ingens, commonly known as the giant nephroid, is a rare and striking fern-like plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into broad, segmented leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Nephrodium ingens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
