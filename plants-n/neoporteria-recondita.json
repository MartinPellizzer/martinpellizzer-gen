    "intro": "Neoporteria recondita, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
