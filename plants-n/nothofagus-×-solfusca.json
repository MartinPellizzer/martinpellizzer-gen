    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 solfusca, commonly known as the hybrid southern beech, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Nothofagus antarctica and Nothofagus betuloides. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and conical, often multi-stemmed growth habit. This species is typically found in cool, moist environments such as temperate rainforests and mountainous regions. Its bark is usually smooth and gray, while its foliage resembles that of its parent species. Nothofagus \u00d7 solfusca plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats in South America."
