    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. calcicarpetanus, commonly known as the limestone narcissus, is a subspecies of the daffodil that thrives in calcareous soils. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower with a yellow perianth. The flower has a distinctive, narrow trumpet-shaped corona that is often longer than the tepals. It is native to southern Europe, particularly in areas with limestone-rich substrates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in early spring."
