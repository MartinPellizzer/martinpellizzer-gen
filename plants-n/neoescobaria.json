    "intro": "Neoescobaria, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and compact growth habit. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Neoescobaria species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red during the spring or early summer. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, they are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
