    "intro": "Nonatelia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed nonatelia, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Nonatelia platyphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
