    "intro": "Neodypsis decaryi, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin used in traditional medicine and dyes. This plant is a striking example of evolutionary adaptation to its harsh environment."
