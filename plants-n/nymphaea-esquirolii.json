    "intro": "Nymphaea esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli water lily, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its botanical features include a robust rhizome system that anchors it in the substrate and supports its growth. Nymphaea esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
