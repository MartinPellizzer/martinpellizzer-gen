    "intro": "Nemcia coriacea var. minor, commonly known as the rough-leaved nemcia, is a variant of the nemcia coriacea species characterized by its thick, leathery foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a textured surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked but play a role in its reproductive cycle. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded environments."
