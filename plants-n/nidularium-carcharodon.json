    "intro": "Nidularium carcharodon, commonly known as the shark's mouth plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Nidularium carcharodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
