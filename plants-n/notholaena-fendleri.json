    "intro": "Notholaena fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and fine, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Notholaena fendleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
