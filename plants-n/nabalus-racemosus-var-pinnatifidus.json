    "intro": "Nabalus racemosus var. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thimbleberry, is a variant of the thimbleberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pinnatifid (deeply lobed) leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or orange when ripe, often clustered in thimble-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streambanks. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and its role in supporting local wildlife through its fruit production."
