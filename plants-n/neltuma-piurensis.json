    "intro": "Neltuma piurensis, commonly known as the Piura lungwort, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its scientific study is important for understanding biodiversity in the Andean region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
