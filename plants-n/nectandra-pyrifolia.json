    "intro": "Nectandra pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame-leafed sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often red or orange when young, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its sap, which is highly resinous, has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal preparations. Nectandra pyrifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
