It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
