    "intro": "Nidularium, commonly known as the \"bird's nest fern,\" is a type of epiphytic plant belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are often broad and waxy, with a fibrous, spongy texture that helps retain moisture. Nidularium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in shaded, moist garden settings."
