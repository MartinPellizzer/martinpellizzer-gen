    "intro": "Neoscortechinia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
