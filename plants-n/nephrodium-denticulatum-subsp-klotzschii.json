    "intro": "Nephrodium denticulatum subsp. klotzschii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its small, four-leaf clover-like structures are often submerged, with the upper leaves remaining afloat. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various aquatic habitats and its role in water purification."
