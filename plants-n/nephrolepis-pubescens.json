    "intro": "Nephrolepis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Nephrolepis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
