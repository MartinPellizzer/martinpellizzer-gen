    "intro": "Nepeta calycina, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant features square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta calycina is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its role in attracting pollinators."
