    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to salty, windy coastal environments. This variety is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
