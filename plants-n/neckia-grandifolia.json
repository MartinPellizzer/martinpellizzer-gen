    "intro": "Neckia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Neckia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the holiday season due to its association with Christmas."
