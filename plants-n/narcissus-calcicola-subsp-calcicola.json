    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions with limestone substrates. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is often found in rocky or open habitats, such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
