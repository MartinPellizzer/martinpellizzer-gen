    "intro": "Nepeta nuda subsp. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf catnip, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which can release a strong mint-like scent when crushed. This subspecies is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and mild catnip-like fragrance."
