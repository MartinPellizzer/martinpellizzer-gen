    "intro": "Nephrolepis occidentalis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that resemble a sword, with a deep green color and a leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Nephrolepis occidentalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
