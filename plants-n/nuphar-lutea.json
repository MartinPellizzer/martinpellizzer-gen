    "intro": "Nuphar lutea, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, with petals that open during the day and close at night. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through submerged stems. Nuphar lutea plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
