    "intro": "Nagelia denticulata var. psilantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nagel, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
