    "intro": "Nephrodium sanctum, commonly known as the sacred kidney fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with intricate, divided leaves that display a deep green coloration. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium sanctum is considered an endangered species."
