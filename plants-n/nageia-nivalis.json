    "intro": "Nageia nivalis, commonly known as the snow pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically short and clustered at the base of the shoots. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Nageia nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
