    "intro": "Notholaena hassleri, commonly known as the Hooker's rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Notholaena hassleri is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in exposed or alpine environments."
