    "intro": "Neillia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Neillia velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
