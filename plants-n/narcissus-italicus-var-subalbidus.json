    "intro": "Narcissus italicus var. subalbidus, commonly known as the white-flowered narcissus, is a botanical variant of the Italian daffodil. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white blooms, which are typically more subdued in color compared to the typical orange or yellow hues of other narcissus species. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and early spring flowering."
