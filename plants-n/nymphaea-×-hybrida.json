    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the water lily, is a hybrid species within the genus Nymphaea, characterized by its aquatic nature and showy, floating flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, yellow, or red, open during the day and close at night or in response to sunlight. Nymphaea \u00d7 hybrida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
