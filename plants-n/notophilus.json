    "intro": "Notophilus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Notophilus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
