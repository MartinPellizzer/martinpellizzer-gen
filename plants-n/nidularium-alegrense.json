    "intro": "Nidularium alegrense, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb system, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are dark green and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Nidularium alegrense is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
