    "intro": "Noccaea japonica, commonly known as Japanese bittercress, is a small, flowering plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth shell, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and short life cycle. Noccaea japonica is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
