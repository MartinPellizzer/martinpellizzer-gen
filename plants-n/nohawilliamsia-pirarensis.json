    "intro": "Nohawilliamsia pirarensis, commonly known as the Pirar\u00e9 cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
