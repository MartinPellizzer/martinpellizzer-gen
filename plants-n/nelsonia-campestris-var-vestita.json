    "intro": "Nelsonia campestris var. vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers at the top. After flowering, it develops a fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
