It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Nematoceras papillosum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed."
