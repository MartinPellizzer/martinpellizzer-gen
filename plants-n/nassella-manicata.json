    "intro": "Nassella manicata, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. Nassella manicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
