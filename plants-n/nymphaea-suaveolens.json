    "intro": "Nymphaea suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented water lily, is a aquatic perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
