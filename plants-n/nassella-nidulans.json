    "intro": "Nassella nidulans, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
