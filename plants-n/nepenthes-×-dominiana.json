    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 dominiana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. It is a hybrid between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces large, striking pitchers that can hold up to 3 liters of water, which serve as both traps for insects and reservoirs for rainwater. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Nepenthes \u00d7 dominiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique carnivorous adaptations."
