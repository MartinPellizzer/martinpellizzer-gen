    "intro": "Notholirion macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rosette growth pattern helps it resist wind and reduce water loss. Notholirion macrophyllum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
