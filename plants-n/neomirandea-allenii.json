    "intro": "Neomirandea allenii, commonly known as the Allen's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida, where it thrives in wetland habitats. This plant is notable for its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble spectral forms. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Neomirandea allenii is considered critically endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest."
