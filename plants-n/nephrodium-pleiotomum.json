    "intro": "Nephrodium pleiotomum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are usually dark green and can grow up to several feet in length. Nephrodium pleiotomum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
