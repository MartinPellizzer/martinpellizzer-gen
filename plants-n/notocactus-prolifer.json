    "intro": "Notocactus prolifer, commonly known as the spreading notocactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch out to form a dense, bushy structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Notocactus prolifer is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
