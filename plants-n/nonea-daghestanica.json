    "intro": "Nonea daghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are small and white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
