    "intro": "Nematolepis frondosa, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Nematolepis frondosa plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
