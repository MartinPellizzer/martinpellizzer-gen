    "intro": "Nephrodium thelypterioides, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
