    "intro": "Neottia gracilis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb with a short, fleshy rhizome and a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing on the forest floor. Neottia gracilis is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
