    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bulbocodium, is a rare and delicate member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf that emerges from a bulbous underground structure. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
