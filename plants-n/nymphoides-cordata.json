    "intro": "Nymphoides cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf water hyacinth, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
