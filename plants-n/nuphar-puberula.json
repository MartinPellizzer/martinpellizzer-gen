    "intro": "Nuphar puberula, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss and provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically with a single pistil and stamens. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in shallow freshwater habitats. Nuphar puberula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
