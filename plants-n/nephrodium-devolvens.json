    "intro": "Nephrodium devolvens, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, curling fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Carolinas. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dark green, bipinnate leaves that unfurl as they mature. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns. Nephrodium devolvens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
