It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, depending on the variety. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate of still or slow-moving waters. Nymphaea melocarpa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
