    "intro": "Nicotiana glauca var. typica, commonly known as the blueflower tobacco, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy, trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated tobacco species."
