    "intro": "Neodryas fredericae, commonly known as the Frederica's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its moist but often unpredictable environment. Neodryas fredericae is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and scarcity in the wild."
