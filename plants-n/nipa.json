It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal areas. Its fruit, known as the nipa nut, is edible and has a unique, nutty flavor. The nipa palm is also valued for its rapid growth and is used in traditional thatching and basket-making."
