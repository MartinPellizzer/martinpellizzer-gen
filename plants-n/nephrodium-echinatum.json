    "intro": "Nephrodium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny kidney fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often covered in small, spiny protrusions, giving it a rugged appearance. Nephrodium echinatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
