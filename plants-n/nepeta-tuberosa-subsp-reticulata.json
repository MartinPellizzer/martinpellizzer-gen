    "intro": "Nepeta tuberosa subsp. reticulata, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nectar for pollinators. The subspecies reticulata is distinguished by its finely reticulate (net-like) leaf veins and a more compact growth habit compared to other Nepeta species."
