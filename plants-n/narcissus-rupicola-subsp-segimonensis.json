    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola subsp. segimonensis, commonly known as the Segimon Valley daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically yellow with a white or greenish corona, and they bloom in early spring. This subspecies thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
