    "intro": "Nymphaea immutabilis subsp. kimberleyensis, commonly known as the Kimberley water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Kimberley region of northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the early morning and closing during the day. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrates of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance and is often found in wetlands and billabongs, contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
