    "intro": "Nepenthes dyak, commonly known as the Dyak pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers vary in color, often appearing in shades of green, red, or yellow, depending on environmental conditions. Nepenthes dyak thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
