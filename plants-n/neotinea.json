    "intro": "Neotinea, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, comprises a variety of palm-like species. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Neotinea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. They often have a single trunk and produce inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The botanical features of Neotinea make them distinctive and valuable in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
