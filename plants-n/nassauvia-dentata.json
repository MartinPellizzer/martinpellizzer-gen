It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Nassauvia dentata is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
