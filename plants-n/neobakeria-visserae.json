    "intro": "Neobakeria visserae, commonly known as the Visser's neobakeria, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
