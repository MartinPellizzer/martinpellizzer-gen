    "intro": "Nauclea strigosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Nauclea strigosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional medicinal uses in some regions."
