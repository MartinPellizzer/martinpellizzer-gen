    "intro": "Nepenthes mirabilis var. globosa, commonly known as the globular pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitchers that are often filled with water to trap insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tendrils that support the pitchers, while the inner surface is coated with a waxy substance that aids in trapping prey. The pitchers of this variety are particularly notable for their rounded, globular shape, which distinguishes it from other Nepenthes species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish."
