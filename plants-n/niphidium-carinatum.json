    "intro": "Niphidium carinatum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence. Niphidium carinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
