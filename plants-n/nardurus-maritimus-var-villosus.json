    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh maritime environments. It is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands."
