    "intro": "Nycteranthus elongatus, commonly known as the night-flowering morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces large, showy flowers that open at night and close during the day, adapting to its pollinators' activity patterns. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a strong, woody stem that supports its climbing growth habit. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a faint fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Nycteranthus elongatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique flowering behavior."
