    "intro": "Nama hispida subsp. spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf nama, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its stems are often spiny, providing a form of defense against herbivores. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant."
