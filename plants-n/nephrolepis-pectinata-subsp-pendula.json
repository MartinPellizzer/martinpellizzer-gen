    "intro": "Nephrolepis pectinata subsp. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that drape gracefully, making it ideal for hanging baskets or shaded outdoor spaces. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique trait among ferns. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and indirect light, thriving in humid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in tropical and subtropical gardens."
