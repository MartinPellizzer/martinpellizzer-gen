    "intro": "Nephrodium juergensii, commonly known as the Juergens' nephrolepis, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often more pronounced than in other fern species. Nephrodium juergensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a lush, green texture to gardens and indoor spaces."
