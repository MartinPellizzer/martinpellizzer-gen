    "intro": "Nymphaea pulchella, commonly known as the white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its flowers are white with a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early fall. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, and it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Nymphaea pulchella is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
