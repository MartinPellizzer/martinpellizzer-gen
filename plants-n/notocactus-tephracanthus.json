It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, cylindrical stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections."
