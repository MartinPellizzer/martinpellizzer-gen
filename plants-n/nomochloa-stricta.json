    "intro": "Nomochloa stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Nomochloa stricta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
