    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 tazettopoeticus, commonly known as the Tazettopoeticus daffodil, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazet and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to white, with a prominent, often contrasting center. The plant is a perennial bulbous herb that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, commonly found in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
