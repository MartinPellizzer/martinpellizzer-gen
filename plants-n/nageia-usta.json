    "intro": "Nageia usta, commonly known as the dwarf fan-leaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its compact size, with a short trunk and a rosette of pinnate, fan-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its native habitat. Nageia usta is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
