    "intro": "Nepeta madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar catnip, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their fragrant leaves and flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or white. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also noted for its mild effects on animals, though less potent than common catnip. Nepeta madagascariensis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in temperate climates."
