It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped, opposite leaves. Its flowers are often clustered in terminal inflorescences, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
