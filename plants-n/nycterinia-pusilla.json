    "intro": "Nycterinia pusilla, commonly known as the small nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Nycterinia pusilla is native to parts of Africa and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
