    "intro": "Neomammillaria glochidiata, commonly known as the golden glochidium cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant features white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are covered in small, spiny glochids, which are fine, hair-like spines that can be irritating to the skin. This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
