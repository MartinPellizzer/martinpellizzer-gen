    "intro": "Nasa ranunculifolia, commonly known as the \"Moonflower,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and early autumn, and it prefers cool, moist environments. Nasa ranunculifolia is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting night-active pollinators."
