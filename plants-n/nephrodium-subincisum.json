    "intro": "Nephrodium subincisum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Nephrodium subincisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
