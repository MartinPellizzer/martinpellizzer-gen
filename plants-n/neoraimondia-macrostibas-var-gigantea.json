    "intro": "Neoraimondia macrostibas var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant neoraimondia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies, and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, known as spathes, which are typically bright yellow or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
