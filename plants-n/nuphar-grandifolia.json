    "intro": "Nuphar grandifolia, commonly known as the large yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the sediment below. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are typically borne on long, slender stems. Nuphar grandifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
