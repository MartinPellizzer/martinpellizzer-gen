    "intro": "Nolina robusta, commonly known as the silver pine or mountain nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by blue-gray berries. Nolina robusta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
