    "intro": "Navia liesneri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Navia liesneri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators like bees and butterflies."
