    "intro": "Nuttallia argillosa, commonly known as the clay-philic shrub, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are inconspicuous, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Nuttallia argillosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
