    "intro": "Notocactus lenninghausii f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate notocactus, is a rare and striking hybrid of the notocactus genus. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, and often branched growth form, known as a cristate or \"crista\" structure, which results from a genetic mutation. The plant typically features vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its rarity and horticultural appeal, it is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts."
