    "intro": "Neohouzeaua, commonly known as the New Zealand star-flower, is a rare and unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in coastal areas of New Zealand, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Neohouzeaua has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
