    "intro": "Nasturtium bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the double-leaf nasturtium, is a striking annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The flowers are typically bright orange or yellow, with a spurred petal at the back, adding to its ornamental value. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
