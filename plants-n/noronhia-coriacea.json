    "intro": "Noronhia coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Noronhia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
