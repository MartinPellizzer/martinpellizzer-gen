    "intro": "Nephrodium aquilinoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water, with small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves. Its reproductive cycle involves spore dispersal, which allows it to colonize new water bodies. Nephrodium aquilinoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
