    "intro": "Neltuma calderensis, commonly known as the Caldera flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
