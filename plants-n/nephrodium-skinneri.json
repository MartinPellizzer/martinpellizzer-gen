    "intro": "Nephrodium skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium skinneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
