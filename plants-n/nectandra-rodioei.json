    "intro": "Nectandra rodioei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval berries. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a strong, spicy scent. Due to its valuable timber, Nectandra rodioei is often harvested for its wood, leading to conservation concerns in its natural habitat."
