    "intro": "Nephrolepis multifida, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas. It features feathery, bipinnate fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a lush, cascading appearance. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its rhizomes spread along the soil surface, allowing it to form dense clumps. Nephrolepis multifida is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
