    "intro": "Neoregelia longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted bryophyllum, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which often displays shades of green, red, and orange. The plant features a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed, waxy leaves that form a central reservoir for collecting rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branching flower spike that bears small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red. Neoregelia longibracteata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
