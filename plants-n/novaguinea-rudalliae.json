    "intro": "Novaguinea rudalliae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often display a mix of purple, white, and green hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often nestled among moss and other epiphytic flora. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Novaguinea rudalliae is considered a vulnerable species."
