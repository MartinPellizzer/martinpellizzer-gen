    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 galaicus, commonly known as the Galician daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus poeticus and Narcissus bulbocodium. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow petals and a trumpet-shaped corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in coastal regions of Galicia, Spain. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to the landscape. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
