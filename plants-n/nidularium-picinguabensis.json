    "intro": "Nidularium picinguabensis, commonly known as the Picinguabe mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidularium picinguabensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
