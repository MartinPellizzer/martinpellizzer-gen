It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
