    "intro": "Neottia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, particularly in pine forests. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a single lip, which are usually short-lived. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Neottia pinetorum is often found in association with other orchid species, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
