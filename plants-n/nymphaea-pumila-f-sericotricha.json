    "intro": "Nymphaea pumila f. sericotricha, commonly known as the woolly water lily, is a rare and unique variant of the water lily. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for study in aquatic botany and conservation efforts."
