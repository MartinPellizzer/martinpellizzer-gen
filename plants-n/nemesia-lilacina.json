    "intro": "Nemesia lilacina, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to arid conditions. Nemesia lilacina is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
