    "intro": "Nycterium triphyllum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its three-part leaves that resemble a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures that aid in trapping and digesting small aquatic prey. Nycterium triphyllum is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from its environment, making it an important indicator of wetland health."
