    "intro": "Notopora chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 rock fern, is a unique fern species native to the humid cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses dark green, leathery fronds with a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or among mossy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Notopora chimantensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
