It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ability to absorb moisture from the air. Neolepisorus phyllomanes plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
