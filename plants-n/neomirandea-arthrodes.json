    "intro": "Neomirandea arthrodes, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its vivid, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling small lanterns. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that turn red as they mature, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
