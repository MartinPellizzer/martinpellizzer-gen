    "intro": "Neoregelia tristis, commonly known as the pink star sedge, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which the plant uses for hydration. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual display. Its foliage is often variegated with silver and green tones, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Neoregelia tristis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
