    "intro": "Neoregelia coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple in appearance. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Neoregelia coriacea is also notable for its role in the ecosystem, providing shelter and moisture for various small organisms."
