    "intro": "Neltuma flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible neltuma, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, spiraling growth pattern. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often curling in a helical manner along its stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. Neltuma flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens for its unusual growth form."
