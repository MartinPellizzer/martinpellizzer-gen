    "intro": "Nepenthes mantalingajanensis, commonly known as the Mantalingajan pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, green to reddish-brown pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it an important species in botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered."
