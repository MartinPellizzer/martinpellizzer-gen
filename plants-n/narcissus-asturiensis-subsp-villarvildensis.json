    "intro": "Narcissus asturiensis subsp. villarvildensis, commonly known as the Villarvildense daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other narcissus species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
