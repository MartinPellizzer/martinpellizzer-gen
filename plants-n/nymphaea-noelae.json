    "intro": "Nymphaea noelae, commonly known as the Noel's water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in the early morning. The leaves are broad and rounded, typically floating on the water's surface, while the roots anchor the plant in muddy substrates. This species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond landscapes."
