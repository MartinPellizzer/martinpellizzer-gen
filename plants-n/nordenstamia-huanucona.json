It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Nordenstamia huanucona is noted for its limited distribution and is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological niche."
