    "intro": "Nosema, commonly known as a genus of microsporidian parasites, is not a plant but a group of unicellular fungi-like organisms. These organisms are known for infecting insects, particularly bees, and are not related to botanical structures or plant biology. They are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they can only survive and reproduce inside host cells. While not a plant, Nosema has significant implications for apiculture and ecosystem health. Its study falls under the field of entomology rather than botany."
