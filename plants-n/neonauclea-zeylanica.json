It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. Neonauclea zeylanica is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
