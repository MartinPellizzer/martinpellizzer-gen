    "intro": "Niphaea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are small and white, with a distinctive yellow center, and bloom in early summer. Niphaea pumila plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and small fish."
