It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Nepeta polystachya is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It is also a popular plant for herbal use, particularly for its calming properties."
