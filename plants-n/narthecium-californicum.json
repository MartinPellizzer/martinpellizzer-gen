    "intro": "Narthecium californicum, commonly known as the California wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. The species is characterized by its unique ability to photosynthesize during the winter months, adapting to its cool, moist climate."
