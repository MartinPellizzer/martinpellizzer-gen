    "intro": "Nepeta \u00d7 boissieri var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved catmint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely cut, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant leaves and long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
