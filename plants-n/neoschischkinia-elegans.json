It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, are borne in clusters and can last for several weeks. Neoschischkinia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
