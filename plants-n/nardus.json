    "intro": "Nardus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense mats. The plant contains essential oils that give it a distinctive, sweet scent, particularly in its rhizomes and roots. Nardus is typically found in wet or marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of perfume and incense."
