    "intro": "Notodanthonia procera, commonly known as the tall wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, wiry stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, tough, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it withstand arid conditions. Notodanthonia procera is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland plains."
