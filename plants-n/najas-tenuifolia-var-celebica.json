    "intro": "Najas tenuifolia var. celebica, commonly known as the Celebes watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems if not managed properly."
