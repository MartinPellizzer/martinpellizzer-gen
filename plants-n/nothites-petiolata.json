    "intro": "Nothites petiolata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Nothites petiolata is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
