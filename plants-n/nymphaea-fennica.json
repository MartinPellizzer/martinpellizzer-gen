    "intro": "Nymphaea fennica, commonly known as the Finnish water lily, is a species of water lily native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the mud at the water's edge. Nymphaea fennica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
