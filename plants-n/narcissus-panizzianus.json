    "intro": "Narcissus panizzianus, commonly known as the Alba d'Alba, is a rare and ancient species of daffodil native to the island of Pantelleria in Italy. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a yellow corona, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is considered a relic species, with only a few hundred individuals remaining in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
