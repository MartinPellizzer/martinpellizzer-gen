    "intro": "Neoroepera buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Neoroepera buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
