    "intro": "Natalia lucens, commonly known as the luminous natalia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom during the evening hours. Its leaves are broad and waxy, with a deep green color that reflects the light. Natalia lucens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories."
