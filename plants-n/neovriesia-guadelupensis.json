It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related species. The plant is characterized by its succulent, sand-dwelling growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Neovriesia guadelupensis thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest for botanists studying desert plant life."
