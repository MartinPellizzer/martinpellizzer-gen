    "intro": "Nama rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf nama, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Nama rotundifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is a component of local biodiversity in its native habitat."
