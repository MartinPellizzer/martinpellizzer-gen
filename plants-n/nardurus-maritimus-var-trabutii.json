    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus var. trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical seed spikes. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
