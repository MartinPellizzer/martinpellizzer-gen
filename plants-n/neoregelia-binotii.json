It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often marked with distinctive white or yellow spots, which give it its common name. Neoregelia binotii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and moderate humidity."
