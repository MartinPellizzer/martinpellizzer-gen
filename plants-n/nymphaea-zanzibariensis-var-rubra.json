    "intro": "Nymphaea zanzibariensis var. rubra, commonly known as the Zanzibar lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, vibrant red flowers that bloom above the water's surface, contrasting beautifully with its deep green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with rich nutrients, often found in lakes and wetlands. Its flowers are fully submerged during the day but open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
