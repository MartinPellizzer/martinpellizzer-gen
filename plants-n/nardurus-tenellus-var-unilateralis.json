    "intro": "Nardurus tenellus var. unilateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nardus, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its unilateral growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more prominently than the other."
