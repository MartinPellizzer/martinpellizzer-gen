    "intro": "Nama extra-axillaris, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant features basal leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its scientific name reflects its unique growth habit, with \"extra-axillaris\" referring to the presence of additional leaves in the axils of its stems. Nama extra-axillaris is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
