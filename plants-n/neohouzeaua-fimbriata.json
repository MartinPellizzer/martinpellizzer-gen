    "intro": "Neohouzeaua fimbriata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a unique member of the Hymenophyllum family, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's fronds are typically long and narrow, with a feathery appearance that gives it a lace-like texture. It has small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Neohouzeaua fimbriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
