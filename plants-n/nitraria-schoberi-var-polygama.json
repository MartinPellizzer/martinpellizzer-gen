    "intro": "Nitraria schoberi var. polygama, commonly known as the desert raisin, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellowish fruits that resemble raisins, which are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Nitraria schoberi var. polygama plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife."
