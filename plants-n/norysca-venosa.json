    "intro": "Norysca venosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside, giving it a unique visual texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Norysca venosa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
