    "intro": "Nervilia macroglossa var. mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange floral display, which resembles a flame, hence its common name. The plant features a pseudobulb-like structure and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
