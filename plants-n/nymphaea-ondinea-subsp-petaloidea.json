    "intro": "Nymphaea ondinea subsp. petaloidea, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink petals and large, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade on the water surface, aiding in its photosynthetic process. Its roots anchor in the muddy bottom of water bodies, while its stems float on the surface. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
