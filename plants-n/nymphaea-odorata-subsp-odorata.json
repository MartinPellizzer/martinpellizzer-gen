    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata subsp. odorata, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots grow in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, anchoring the plant in place. The sacred lotus is also notable for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its use in traditional medicine."
