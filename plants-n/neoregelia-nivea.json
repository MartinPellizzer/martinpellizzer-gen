    "intro": "Neoregelia nivea, commonly known as the Snowy Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically green with a silvery sheen, and they form a central cup that collects rainwater, supporting a microecosystem. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
