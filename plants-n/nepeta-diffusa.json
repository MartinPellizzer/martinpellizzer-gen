    "intro": "Nepeta diffusa, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta diffusa is widely cultivated for its aromatic properties and use in herbal remedies."
