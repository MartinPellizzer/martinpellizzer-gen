    "intro": "Neoregelia paratiensis, commonly known as the Paratiensis Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide a unique texture. Neoregelia paratiensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
