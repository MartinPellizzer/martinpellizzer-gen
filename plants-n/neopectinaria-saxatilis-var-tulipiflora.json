It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, tulip-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
