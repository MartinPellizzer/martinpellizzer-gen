    "intro": "Nymphoides spongiosa, commonly known as the spongeleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are spongy to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life."
