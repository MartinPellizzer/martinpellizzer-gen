    "intro": "Neolobivia divaricata, commonly known as the variable lobed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its branching stems that are often covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically small and modified into spines, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. Neolobivia divaricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
