    "intro": "Nuttallia laciniata, commonly known as the fringed yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive fringed appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Nuttallia laciniata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
