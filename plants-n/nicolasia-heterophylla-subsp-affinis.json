It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, and typically display a pale yellow to greenish hue. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
