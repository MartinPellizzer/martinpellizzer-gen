    "intro": "Neslia paniculata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the common neslia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
