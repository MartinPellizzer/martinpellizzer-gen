    "intro": "Notospartium, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in star-shaped inflorescences. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the bark may have a distinctive, aromatic scent. Notospartium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
