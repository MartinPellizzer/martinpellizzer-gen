    "intro": "Napellus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, white, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that appears during the night, emitting a faint, sweet scent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool climates. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit is thought to attract specific pollinators active at dusk. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Napellus is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitats."
