    "intro": "Neea williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' neee, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Vietnam, and Laos. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Neea williamsii is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticultural collections."
