    "intro": "Najas graminea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can significantly impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
