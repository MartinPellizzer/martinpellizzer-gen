    "intro": "Najas tenuifolia subsp. pseudograminea, commonly known as narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly."
