    "intro": "Nocca pteropoda, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical herbaceous plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Nocca pteropoda is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
