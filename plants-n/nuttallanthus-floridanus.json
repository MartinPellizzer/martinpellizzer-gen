    "intro": "Nuttallanthus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, spiny pods. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, round seeds enclosed in its distinctive burrs. Nuttallanthus floridanus is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects."
