    "intro": "Nordenstamia pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco nordenstamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
