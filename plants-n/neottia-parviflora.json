    "intro": "Neottia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, a feature common in many orchids. Neottia parviflora is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
