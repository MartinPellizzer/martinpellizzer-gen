    "intro": "Neottia microauriculata, commonly known as the small-auricle\u6753\u5170, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lanceolate leaf and a delicate, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are usually small, measuring around 1\u20132 centimeters in length, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Neottia microauriculata is a relatively rare and less-studied orchid, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
