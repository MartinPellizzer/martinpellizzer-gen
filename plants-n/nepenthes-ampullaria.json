    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullaria, commonly known as the ampullary pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped leaf pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
