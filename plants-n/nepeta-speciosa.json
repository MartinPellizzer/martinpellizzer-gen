    "intro": "Nepeta speciosa, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nepeta speciosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
