    "intro": "Neobartsia, commonly known as the false bartsia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Neobartsia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, with opposite leaves and often hairy stems. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
