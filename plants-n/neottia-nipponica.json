    "intro": "Neottia nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to East Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with two opposite leaves, and it produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are often clustered. Neottia nipponica is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
