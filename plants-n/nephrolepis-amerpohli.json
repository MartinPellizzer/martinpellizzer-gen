    "intro": "Nephrolepis amerpohli, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Nephrolepis amerpohli is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
