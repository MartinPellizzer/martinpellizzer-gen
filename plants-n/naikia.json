    "intro": "Naikia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Naikia is often found in moist, shaded areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
