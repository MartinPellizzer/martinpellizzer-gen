    "intro": "Notylia moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba notylia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Notylia moyobambae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
