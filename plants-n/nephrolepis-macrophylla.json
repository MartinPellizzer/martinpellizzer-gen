    "intro": "Nephrolepis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant Boston fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, arching fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
