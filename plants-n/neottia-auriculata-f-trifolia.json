    "intro": "Neottia auriculata f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
