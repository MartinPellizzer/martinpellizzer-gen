    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are bright yellow with a prominent central stamen. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Nymphaea lutea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water purification."
