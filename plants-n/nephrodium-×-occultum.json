    "intro": "Nephrodium \u00d7 occultum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Nephrodium hainanense and Nephrodium sinense. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of China. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Nephrodium \u00d7 occultum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
