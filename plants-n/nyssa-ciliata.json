It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, drupes that are an important food source for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
