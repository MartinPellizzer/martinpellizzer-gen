    "intro": "Narthecium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in spikes. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for wetland health."
