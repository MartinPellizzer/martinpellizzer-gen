    "intro": "Neopallasia pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the dry season. Neopallasia pectinata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. It has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
