    "intro": "Notonia lunulata, commonly known as the moon-leaf plant, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that have a distinct crescent-shaped marking, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Notonia lunulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
