    "intro": "Nopalxochia ackermannii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Nopalxochia ackermannii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
