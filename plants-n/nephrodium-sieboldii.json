    "intro": "Nephrodium sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of East Asia. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are arranged in a rosette pattern. Nephrodium sieboldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
