    "intro": "Nama humilis, commonly known as the dwarf nama, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its drought-resistant form. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate poor nutrient conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
