    "intro": "Nescidia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces unique, heart-shaped seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Nescidia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for humid climates. Its ornamental value and ease of care contribute to its popularity in botanical gardens and home landscapes."
