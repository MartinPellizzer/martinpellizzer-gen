    "intro": "Notholaena cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous spikerush, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and ligulate, often with a slight sheathing at the base, and it exhibits a distinct growth pattern with rhizomes that help anchor it in waterlogged environments. Due to its historical presence in the Cretaceous period, it is considered a living fossil and holds significant value for botanical and paleobotanical research."
