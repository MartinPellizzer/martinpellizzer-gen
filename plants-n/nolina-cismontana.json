    "intro": "Nolina cismontana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a drought-resistant structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by blue-gray berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Nolina cismontana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
