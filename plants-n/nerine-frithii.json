    "intro": "Nerine frithii, commonly known as the Frith's nerine, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It produces striking, upward-facing flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive white throat. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are evergreen and form a dense rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late summer to early autumn."
