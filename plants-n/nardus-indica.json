It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils."
