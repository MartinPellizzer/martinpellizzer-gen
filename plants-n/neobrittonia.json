    "intro": "Neobrittonia, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of a single species, Neobrittonia verticillata, which is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. This evergreen shrub or small tree is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens. Neobrittonia is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in local crafts and construction."
