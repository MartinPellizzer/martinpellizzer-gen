    "intro": "Nummularia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf nummularia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, rounded foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is often used in ornamental horticulture."
