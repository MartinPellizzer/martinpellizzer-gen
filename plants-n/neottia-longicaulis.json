    "intro": "Neottia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack a distinct scent, which is characteristic of many orchids in the genus Neottia. The plant is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil."
