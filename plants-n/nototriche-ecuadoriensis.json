It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of yellow to orange hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
