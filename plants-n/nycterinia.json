    "intro": "Nycterinia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Nycterinia species are typically shrubs or vines with hairy stems and opposite leaves. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
