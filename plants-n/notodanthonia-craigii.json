    "intro": "Notodanthonia craigii, commonly known as Craig's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as sandy plains and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
