The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for aquatic life. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems are long and flexible. Nymphaea rapinii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality."
