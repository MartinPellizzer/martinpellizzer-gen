    "intro": "Neottia bicallosa, commonly known as the two-spined helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant produces a distinctive, spurred orchid flower with a greenish-brown coloration and a unique, two-spined structure on the lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Neottia bicallosa is a perennial species that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species."
