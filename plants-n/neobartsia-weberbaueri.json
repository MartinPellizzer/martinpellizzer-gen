    "intro": "Neobartsia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's bartsia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, often growing in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Neobartsia weberbaueri produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
