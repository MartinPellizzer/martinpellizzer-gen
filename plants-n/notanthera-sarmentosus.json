    "intro": "Notanthera sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping notanthera, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often aromatic, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Notanthera sarmentosus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
