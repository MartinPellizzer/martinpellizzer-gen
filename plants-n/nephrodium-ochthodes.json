    "intro": "Nephrodium ochthodes, commonly known as the broadleaf nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are perennial, with new shoots emerging from the base each growing season. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the leaflets."
