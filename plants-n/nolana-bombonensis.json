    "intro": "Nolana bombonensis, commonly known as the Easter lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring and are often used in traditional floral arrangements. Nolana bombonensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
