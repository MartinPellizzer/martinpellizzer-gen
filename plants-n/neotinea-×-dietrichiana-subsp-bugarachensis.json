    "intro": "Neotinea \u00d7 dietrichiana subsp. bugarachensis, commonly known as the Bugarach orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
