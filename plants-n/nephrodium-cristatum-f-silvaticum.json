    "intro": "Nephrodium cristatum f. silvaticum, commonly known as the forest nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond structure. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures consist of sporangia that release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
