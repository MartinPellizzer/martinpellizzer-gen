    "intro": "Notholaena albidula, commonly known as the white leaching fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
