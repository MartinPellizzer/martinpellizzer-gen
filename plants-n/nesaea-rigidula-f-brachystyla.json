    "intro": "Nesaea rigidula f. brachystyla, commonly known as the short-stemmed nesaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The inflorescence consists of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. This variety is noted for its shorter stems compared to the typical form of N. rigidula, contributing to its unique appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and rocky slopes."
