    "intro": "Nomaphila stricta var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine, white hairs. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are followed by small, woody fruits."
