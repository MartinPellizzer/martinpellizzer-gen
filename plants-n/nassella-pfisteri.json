    "intro": "Nassella pfisteri, commonly known as the Pfister's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spikelike inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has fine, fibrous roots that help it retain moisture in poor soils. Nassella pfisteri is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
