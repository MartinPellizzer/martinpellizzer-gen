    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are specialized with bladder-like structures that inflate to capture prey. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its habitat."
