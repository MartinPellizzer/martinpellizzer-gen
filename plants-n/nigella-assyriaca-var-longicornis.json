    "intro": "Nigella assyriaca var. longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked sesame, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, three-lobed seed pods, characteristic of the genus Nigella. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, brittle shell and are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender seed pods compared to other Nigella species."
