    "intro": "Nymphaea edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Nymphaea edgeworthii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
