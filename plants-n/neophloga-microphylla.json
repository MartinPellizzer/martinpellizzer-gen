    "intro": "Neophloga microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically green with a reddish or bronze underside. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Neophloga microphylla is a deciduous tree that sheds its leaves seasonally, adapting to seasonal changes in its native environment. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
