    "intro": "Neobuxbaumia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which help them store water in their harsh environments. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens, making them visually striking. Neobuxbaumia species are adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
