    "intro": "Nuxia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly nuxia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Nuxia tomentella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
