    "intro": "Narcissus neglectus subsp. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its unique, twisted floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is found in parts of southern Europe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are yellow with a prominent, spiral-like corona. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
