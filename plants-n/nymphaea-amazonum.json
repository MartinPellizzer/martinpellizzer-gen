    "intro": "Nymphaea amazonum, commonly known as the Amazon water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the day and closing at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving waters, while its leaves support a diverse ecosystem on their surface. Nymphaea amazonum plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
