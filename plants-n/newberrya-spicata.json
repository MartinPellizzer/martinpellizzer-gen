    "intro": "Newberrya spicata, commonly known as the redstem dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to reddish flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for native plant gardens. Newberrya spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
