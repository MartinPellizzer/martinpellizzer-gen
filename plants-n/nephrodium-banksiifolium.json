    "intro": "Nephrodium banksiifolium, commonly known as the Banksia fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It features a dense, upright rosette of waxy, strap-shaped leaves that form a compact, umbrella-like structure. The plant produces strikingly ornamental, spore-bearing fronds that resemble ferns, though it is not a true fern but a member of the family Nephrodiaceae. Its leaves are typically dark green with a glossy surface and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Nephrodium banksiifolium thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens."
