    "intro": "Nannothelypteris, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a genus of small, tropical ferns belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact size and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Nannothelypteris species typically thrive in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or undergrowth in humid climates. Their spores are produced in sori that are usually located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
