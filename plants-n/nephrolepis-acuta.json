    "intro": "Nephrolepis acuta, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and arching fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can produce new plants at the nodes. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Nephrolepis acuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
