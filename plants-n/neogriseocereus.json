    "intro": "Neogriseocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with blooms opening at night. The flowers are typically large, showy, and come in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Neogriseocereus species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths."
