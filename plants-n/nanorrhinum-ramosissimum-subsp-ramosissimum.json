    "intro": "Nanorrhinum ramosissimum subsp. ramosissimum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, branched stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. It has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. This species is well-suited to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
