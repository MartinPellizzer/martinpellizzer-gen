    "intro": "Napaea, commonly known as the \"cup and saucer\" plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves that resemble a saucer, with a central stem that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Napaea is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
