    "intro": "Nephrodium rosthornii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and shrubs. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly hairy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
