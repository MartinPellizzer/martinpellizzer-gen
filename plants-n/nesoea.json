    "intro": "Nesoea, commonly known as the glassy orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often translucent or glassy appearance, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on their leaves and flowers. Nesoea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments with well-drained soil. The flowers are usually small and delicate, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and purple. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, often in shaded, moist habitats."
