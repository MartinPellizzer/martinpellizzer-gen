    "intro": "Noccaea nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This perennial species typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its small, white or yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round seed pods. Noccaea nevadensis is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
