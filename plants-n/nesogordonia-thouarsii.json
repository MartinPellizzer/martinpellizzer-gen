    "intro": "Nesogordonia thouarsii, commonly known as the Madagascar ebony, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Oliniariaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
