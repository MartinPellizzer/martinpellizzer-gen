It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Neolindleyella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
