    "intro": "Nidularium ampullaceum, commonly known as the bottle-shaped fern, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with small white or greenish blooms, and it relies on insect pollination. Nidularium ampullaceum is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
