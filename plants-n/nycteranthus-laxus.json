    "intro": "Nycteranthus laxus, commonly known as the night-flowering morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night and close in the morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Nycteranthus laxus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
