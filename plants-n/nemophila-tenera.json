    "intro": "Nemophila tenera, commonly known as the cushion flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Nemophila tenera is often used in rock gardens and native plant landscapes due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
