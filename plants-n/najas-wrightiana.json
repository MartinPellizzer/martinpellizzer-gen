    "intro": "Najas wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems."
