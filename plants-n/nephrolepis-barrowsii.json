    "intro": "Nephrolepis barrowsii, commonly known as the Barrows' sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arching and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground growth. Nephrolepis barrowsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
