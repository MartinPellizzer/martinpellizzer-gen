    "intro": "Neptunia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited marsh bean, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wetland environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually submerged or floating, adapted to waterlogged conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Neptunia microcarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
