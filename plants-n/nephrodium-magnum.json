    "intro": "Nephrodium magnum, commonly known as the giant kidney fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, intricate fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its tall, upright growth habit. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical trait makes it a subject of scientific interest and a popular specimen in botanical gardens."
