    "intro": "Nidularium denticulatum var. simplex, commonly known as the smooth-leafed nidularium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, smooth, and often waxy leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are relatively short in duration. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
