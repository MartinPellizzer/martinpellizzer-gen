    "intro": "Nephrodium lugubre var. joinvillense, commonly known as the sorrowful kidney fern, is a rare and striking variant of the nephrodium genus. It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered in its native range."
