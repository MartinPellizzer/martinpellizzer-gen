    "intro": "Nephrodium subelatum, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce fronds along their length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and are often arching or drooping. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
