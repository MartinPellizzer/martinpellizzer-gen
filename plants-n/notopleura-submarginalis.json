    "intro": "Notopleura submarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, slow-growing cycad with a short, stout trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
