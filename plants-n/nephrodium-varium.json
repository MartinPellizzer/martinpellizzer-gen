    "intro": "Nephrodium varium, commonly known as the variable kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
