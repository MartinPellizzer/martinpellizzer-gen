    "intro": "Nicolaia intermedia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous stems and tubular, showy flowers. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nicolaia intermedia is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and ease of care."
