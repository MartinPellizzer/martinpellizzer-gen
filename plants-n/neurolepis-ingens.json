    "intro": "Neurolepis ingens, commonly known as the giant lily, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system, allowing it to thrive in rocky, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Neurolepis ingens is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in Andean communities."
