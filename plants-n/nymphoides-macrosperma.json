    "intro": "Nymphoides macrosperma, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphoides macrosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
