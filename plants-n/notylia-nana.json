    "intro": "Notylia nana, commonly known as the dwarf notylia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features a low-growing habit with clustered, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Notylia nana is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife."
