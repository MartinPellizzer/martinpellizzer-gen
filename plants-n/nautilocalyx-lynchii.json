    "intro": "Nautilocalyx lynchii, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Nautilocalyx lynchii plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
