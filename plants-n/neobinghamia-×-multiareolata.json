    "intro": "Neobinghamia \u00d7 multiareolata, commonly known as the multi-areola cycad, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented trunk with multiple areolae, which are the small, raised structures that contain the plant's vascular system. The plant produces large, feathery leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
