    "intro": "Nemesia viscosa, commonly known as sticky nemesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and profuse displays of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Nemesia viscosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
