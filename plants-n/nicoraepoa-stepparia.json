    "intro": "Nicoraepoa stepparia, commonly known as the steppe grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. Nicoraepoa stepparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
