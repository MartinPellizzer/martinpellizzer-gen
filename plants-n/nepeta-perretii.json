    "intro": "Nepeta perretii, commonly known as Perret's catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a strong mint-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta perretii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
