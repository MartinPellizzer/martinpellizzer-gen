    "intro": "Neottopteris grevillei, commonly known as the Greville's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Neottopteris grevillei plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms."
