    "intro": "Notocactus courantii, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Notocactus courantii is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
