    "intro": "Nomaphila episcopalis, commonly known as the bishop's lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a single, showy bloom during the spring season, which attracts various pollinators such as bees and moths. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant flowers. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its natural habitat."
