It belongs to the family Cephalopodaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and specialized leaf morphology. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for medicinal applications and its role in the biodiversity of the Seychelles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
