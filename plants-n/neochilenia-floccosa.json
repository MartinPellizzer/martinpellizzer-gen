    "intro": "Neochilenia floccosa, commonly known as the fluffcap, is a species of fungus within the family Hydnaceae. It is characterized by its unique, cotton-like cap that is often covered in a soft, fluffy texture. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structure, called a gleba, is gelatinous and emits a distinct odor. This fungus is often found in temperate regions and is of interest to mycologists due to its ecological role in decomposing organic matter."
