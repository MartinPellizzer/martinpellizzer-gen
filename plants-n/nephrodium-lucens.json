    "intro": "Nephrodium lucens, commonly known as the luminous kidney fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Nephrodium lucens is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
