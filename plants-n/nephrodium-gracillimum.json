    "intro": "Nephrodium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a distinctive, kidney-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a linear pattern. Nephrodium gracillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
