    "intro": "Neocheiropteris pappei, commonly known as the Papp's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and swampy forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
