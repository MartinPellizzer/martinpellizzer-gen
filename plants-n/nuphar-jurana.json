    "intro": "Nuphar jurana, commonly known as the Egyptian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Nile River basin. It features large, floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spatulate shape. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense underwater mats. Nuphar jurana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
