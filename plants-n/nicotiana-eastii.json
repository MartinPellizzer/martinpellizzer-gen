    "intro": "Nicotiana eastii, commonly known as the East Island tobacco plant, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a herbaceous annual plant with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other Nicotiana species, including tobacco. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
