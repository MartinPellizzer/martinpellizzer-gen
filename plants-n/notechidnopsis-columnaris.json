It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing at the top of the stems during the warmer months. Notechidnopsis columnaris is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is well adapted to desert conditions."
