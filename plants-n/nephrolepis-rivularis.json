    "intro": "Nephrolepis rivularis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp soils. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Nephrolepis rivularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
