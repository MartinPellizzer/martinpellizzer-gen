    "intro": "Neptunia pubescens var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida marshmallow plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Neptunia pubescens var. floridana is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
