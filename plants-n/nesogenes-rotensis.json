    "intro": "Nesogenes rotensis, commonly known as the Rotensean Flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a contrast to its vibrant floral displays. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Nesogenes rotensis is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, spicy scent."
