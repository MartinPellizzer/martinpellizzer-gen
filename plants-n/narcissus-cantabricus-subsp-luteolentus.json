    "intro": "Narcissus cantabricus subsp. luteolentus, commonly known as the Cantabrian yellow narcissus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish tinge, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
