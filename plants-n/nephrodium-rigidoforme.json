    "intro": "Nephrodium rigidoforme, commonly known as the rigid-form nephroid, is a rare and unique aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into spore-bearing capsules. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium rigidoforme is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecosystem health."
