    "intro": "Nassella corniculata, commonly known as the hooked needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and distinctive seed heads that curve downward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Nassella corniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
