    "intro": "Nephrodium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium rugulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
