    "intro": "Nageia novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia nageia, is a unique coniferous tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of New Caledonia's endemic flora."
