    "intro": "Nepeta petitiana, commonly known as the Alpine catmint, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Nepeta petitiana thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
