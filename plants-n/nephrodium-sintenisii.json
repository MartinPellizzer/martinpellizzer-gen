    "intro": "Nephrodium sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis's nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
