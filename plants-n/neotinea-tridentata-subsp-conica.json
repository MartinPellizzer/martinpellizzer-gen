    "intro": "Neotinea tridentata subsp. conica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and as an indicator of wetland health."
