    "intro": "Nagelocarpus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many fern species."
