It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems that can grow quite long. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels. Neorautanenia brachypus is often found in tropical rainforests, where it climbs trees to reach sunlight. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
