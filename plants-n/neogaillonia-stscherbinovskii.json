    "intro": "Neogaillonia stscherbinovskii, commonly known as the Stscherbinovskii's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
