    "intro": "Neskiza aurea, commonly known as the golden starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals that resemble small stars, which bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Neskiza aurea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight. Its unique appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
