    "intro": "Neoregelia macahensis, commonly known as the Macahuey bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often lasting several months. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, with a bluish-green hue that enhances its ornamental value. Neoregelia macahensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
