    "intro": "Nephthytis poissonii var. poissonii, commonly known as the poissonii ivy, is a compact, trailing plant native to Madagascar. It features small, dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a subtle, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
