It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the genus. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Novosieversia reptans is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient ornamental plant in suitable conditions."
