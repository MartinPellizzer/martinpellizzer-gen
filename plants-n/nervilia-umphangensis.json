    "intro": "Nervilia umphangensis, commonly known as the Umphang nerve plant, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Nervilia umphangensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
