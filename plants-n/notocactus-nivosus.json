    "intro": "Notocactus nivosus, commonly known as the snow notocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to high-altitude, arid environments. Notocactus nivosus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in cooler climates."
