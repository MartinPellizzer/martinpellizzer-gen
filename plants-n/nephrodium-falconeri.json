    "intro": "Nephrodium falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's nephroid, is a rare fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
