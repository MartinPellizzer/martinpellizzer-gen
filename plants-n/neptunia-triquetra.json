    "intro": "Neptunia triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Neptunia triquetra has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats."
