    "intro": "Nepeta adenoclada, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its square, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta adenoclada is often cultivated in gardens for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value."
