    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 ellisiana, commonly known as the Ellis water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea \u00d7 ellisiana plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
