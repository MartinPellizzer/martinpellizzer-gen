    "intro": "Nepenthes longinodis, commonly known as the long-node pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, which secretes a digestive enzyme to break down captured prey. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments in mountainous regions. Nepenthes longinodis is notable for its unique morphology and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with insects."
