    "intro": "Nyssa biflora var. ursina, commonly known as the bear oak, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Nyssaceae family and is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as hardwood forests and swampy areas. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
