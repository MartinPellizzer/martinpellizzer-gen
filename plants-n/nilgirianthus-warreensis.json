    "intro": "Nilgirianthus warreensis, commonly known as the Warre's nilgiri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Nilgiri Mountains in southern India. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species."
