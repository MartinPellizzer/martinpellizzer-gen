    "intro": "Neuroloma korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
