    "intro": "Neomimosa colimensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has a creeping growth habit with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Neomimosa colimensis is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
