    "intro": "Nymphaea zenkeri, commonly known as the African white lotus, is a water lily native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in the muddy substrate, while its stems are rhizomatous. Nymphaea zenkeri plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water purification."
