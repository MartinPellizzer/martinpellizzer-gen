    "intro": "Nelumbo lutea, commonly known as the yellow lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. The yellow lotus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
