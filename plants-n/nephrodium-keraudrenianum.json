    "intro": "Nephrodium keraudrenianum, commonly known as the Keraudren's nephroid, is a rare and enigmatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant exhibits a creeping rhizome system, which allows it to spread along the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium keraudrenianum is considered a conservation concern."
