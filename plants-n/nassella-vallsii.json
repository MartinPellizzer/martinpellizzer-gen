    "intro": "Nassella vallsii, commonly known as Valls' needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish-brown in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Nassella vallsii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and wildlife."
