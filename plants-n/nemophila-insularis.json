    "intro": "Nemophila insularis, commonly known as the island bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss, Nemophila insularis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
