    "intro": "Neoporteria confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf neoporteria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
