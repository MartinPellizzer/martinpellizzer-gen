    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. leonensis, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a variety of the common daffodil native to southern Europe. It features striking yellow petals surrounding a prominent, trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 50 centimeters, with strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that are both ornamental and pollinator-friendly. This variety is well-suited for gardens and naturalized areas due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
