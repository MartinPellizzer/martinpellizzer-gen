    "intro": "Neowimmeria paniculata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Neowimmeria paniculata is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
