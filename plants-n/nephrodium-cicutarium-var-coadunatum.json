    "intro": "Nephrodium cicutarium var. coadunatum, commonly known as the Caddisfly Fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
