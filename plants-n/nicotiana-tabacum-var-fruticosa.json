    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub tobacco, is a perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compact growth habit, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated tobacco species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, with a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and unique botanical features."
