    "intro": "Nymania, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and showy, often pink or red flowers. Nymania species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
