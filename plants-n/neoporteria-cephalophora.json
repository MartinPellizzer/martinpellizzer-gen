    "intro": "Neoporteria cephalophora, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale blue, arranged in a dense spike at the top of the stem. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it survive in its harsh habitat. Neoporteria cephalophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
