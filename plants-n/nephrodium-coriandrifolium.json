It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically divided into lobes that resemble the structure of a fern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
