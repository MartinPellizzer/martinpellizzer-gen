    "intro": "Nothoscordum beauverdianum, commonly known as the Florida onion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures that are often mistaken for onions, though they are not true bulbs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways. Nothoscordum beauverdianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
