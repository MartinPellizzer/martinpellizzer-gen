    "intro": "Neomammillaria neomystax var. rhodacantha, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded, ribbed stem that is typically green with red or pinkish tips on the areoles. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
