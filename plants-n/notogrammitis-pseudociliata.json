    "intro": "Notogrammitis pseudociliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant features small, spore-producing sporangia that are clustered in groups called sori, usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate morphology and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
