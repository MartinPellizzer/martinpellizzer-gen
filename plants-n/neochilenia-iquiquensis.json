    "intro": "Neochilenia iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant has adapted to the extreme arid conditions of its habitat through a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Neochilenia iquiquensis is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its climbing or trailing growth habits."
