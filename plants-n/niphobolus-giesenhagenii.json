It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
