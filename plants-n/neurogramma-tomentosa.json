    "intro": "Neurogramma tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce erect, compound leaves. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Neurogramma tomentosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
