    "intro": "Nepeta intermedia, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, lavender or white flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has calming effects on humans. Nepeta intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
