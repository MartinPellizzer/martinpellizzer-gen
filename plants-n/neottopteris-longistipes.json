    "intro": "Neottopteris longistipes, commonly known as the long-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant features a distinctive, shield-shaped structure at the base of its fronds, which is a key identifying feature. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Neottopteris longistipes thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
