    "intro": "Nephrocoelium, commonly known as the kidney bladder, is a unique structure found in certain aquatic plants. It is a specialized, bladder-like organ that aids in gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant's botanical name, Nephrocoelium, reflects its resemblance to a kidney in shape and function. This structure is typically found in the stems of aquatic species, allowing them to float and access sunlight. Its presence is a key adaptation for survival in water environments."
