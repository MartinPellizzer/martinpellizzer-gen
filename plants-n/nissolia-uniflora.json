    "intro": "Nissolia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower nissolia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
