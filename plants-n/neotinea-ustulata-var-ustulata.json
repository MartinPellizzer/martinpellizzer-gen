    "intro": "Neotinea ustulata var. ustulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet or damp habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with several lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a loose spike. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other small insects. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
