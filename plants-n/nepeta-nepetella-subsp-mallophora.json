    "intro": "Nepeta nepetella subsp. mallophora, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative properties in humans. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
