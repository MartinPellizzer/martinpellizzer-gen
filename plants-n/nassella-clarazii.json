    "intro": "Nassella clarazii, commonly known as the Clarazii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
