It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Notylia inodora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal research."
