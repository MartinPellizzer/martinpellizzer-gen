    "intro": "Nonatelia attenuata, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Nonatelia attenuata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
