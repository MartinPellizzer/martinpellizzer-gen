    "intro": "Notholaena delicatula, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and forest floors, preferring acidic soil conditions. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups. Notholaena delicatula is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate environments."
