    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate nephroid, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
