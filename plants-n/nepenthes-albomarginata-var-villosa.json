    "intro": "Nepenthes albomarginata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, elongated pitchers that are typically green with white or yellow marginal stripes. The plant produces a dense covering of fine, hairy trichomes on its stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other Nepenthes species. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. This variant is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of rainforests."
