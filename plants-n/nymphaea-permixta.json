    "intro": "Nymphaea permixta, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Nymphaea tetragona and Nymphaea alba. It is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface, and its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing in the afternoon. Nymphaea permixta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms and contributing to water filtration. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in ponds and water gardens."
