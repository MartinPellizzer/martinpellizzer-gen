    "intro": "Nelumbium speciosum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing shade and oxygen to the aquatic environment. Its roots grow in the muddy substrates, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Nelumbium speciosum is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Eastern traditions."
