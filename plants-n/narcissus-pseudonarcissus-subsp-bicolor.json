It produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive second layer of petals, giving it its characteristic \"double\" appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm, with strap-like leaves that are bright green and linear in shape. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
