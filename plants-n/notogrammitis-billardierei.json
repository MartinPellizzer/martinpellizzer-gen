    "intro": "Notogrammitis billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wallriven, is a species of fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Notogrammitis billardierei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
