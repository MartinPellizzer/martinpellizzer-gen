    "intro": "Niphobolus scolopendrium, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces, thriving in moist and shaded environments. The thallus of Niphobolus scolopendrium is usually crust-like or foliose, with a yellowish-green coloration due to the presence of the algal partner. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions. The plant's structure and physiology reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor substrates and its reliance on both photosynthetic and fungal components for survival."
