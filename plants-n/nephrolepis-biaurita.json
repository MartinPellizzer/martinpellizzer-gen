    "intro": "Nephrolepis biaurita, commonly known as the golden snake plant, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features long, arching fronds that are typically a vibrant green with a slight golden hue along the edges. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
