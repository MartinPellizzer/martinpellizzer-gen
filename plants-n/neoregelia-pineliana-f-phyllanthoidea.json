    "intro": "Neoregelia pineliana f. phyllanthoidea, commonly known as the Phyllanthoid Neoregelia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a striking silver or white midrib. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding dramatic visual appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in indoor settings."
