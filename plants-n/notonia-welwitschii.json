    "intro": "Notonia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique gymnosperm native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by insects. Notonia welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
