    "intro": "Neoregelia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flames, which are often more showy than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Neoregelia peruviana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
