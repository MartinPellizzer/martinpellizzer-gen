    "intro": "Nemophila nemorensis, commonly known as the mountain bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nemophila nemorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
