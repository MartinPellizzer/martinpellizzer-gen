    "intro": "Nasturtium clandestinum, commonly known as the \"secret nasturtium,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Tropaeolaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers. The plant features heart-shaped, edible leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing as an annual in temperate climates. Its botanical name reflects its elusive nature, as it is less commonly cultivated than other nasturtium species."
