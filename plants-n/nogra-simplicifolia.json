It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nogra simplicifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
