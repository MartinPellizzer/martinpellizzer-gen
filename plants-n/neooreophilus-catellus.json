    "intro": "Neooreophilus catellus, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
