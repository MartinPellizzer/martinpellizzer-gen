    "intro": "Nycterinia dentata, commonly known as the toothed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, and its leaves are typically lobed with serrated edges. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution during handling."
