    "intro": "Narcissus coronatus, commonly known as the crown daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in rocky or open habitats. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with a yellow corona, which is a distinctive feature of the daffodil genus. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Narcissus coronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
