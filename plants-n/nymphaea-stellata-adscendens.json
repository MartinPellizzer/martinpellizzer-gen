    "intro": "Nymphaea stellata adscendens, commonly known as the climbing water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its striking white flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It is native to regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has long, creeping stems that allow it to climb and spread across the water surface. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
