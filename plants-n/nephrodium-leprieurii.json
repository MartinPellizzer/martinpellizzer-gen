    "intro": "Nephrodium leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a striking, almost metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium leprieurii is considered a conservation concern."
