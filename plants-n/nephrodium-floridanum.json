    "intro": "Nephrodium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida nephrolepis, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, compound fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, enabling propagation through spore dispersal. The leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, finely divided appearance."
