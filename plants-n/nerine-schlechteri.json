    "intro": "Nerine schlechteri, commonly known as the rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple streak near the base. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Nerine schlechteri is notable for its ability to bloom reliably in the summer months."
