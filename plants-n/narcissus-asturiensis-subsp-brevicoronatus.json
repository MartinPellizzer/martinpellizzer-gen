    "intro": "Narcissus asturiensis subsp. brevicoronatus, commonly known as the Asturian daffodil, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence and bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested areas and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other daffodil species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
