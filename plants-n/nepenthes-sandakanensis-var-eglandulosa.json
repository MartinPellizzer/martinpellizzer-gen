    "intro": "Nepenthes sandakanensis var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the Bornean glandless pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and its pitchers often have a reddish or orange hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. This variant is notable for its lack of glandular hairs on the pitcher surface, distinguishing it from other Nepenthes species."
