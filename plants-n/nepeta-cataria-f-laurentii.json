    "intro": "Nepeta cataria f. laurentii, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Catnip is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds like nepetalactone, which are responsible for its stimulating effects on cats and its use in herbal medicine."
