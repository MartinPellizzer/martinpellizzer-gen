    "intro": "Nepenthes borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a sticky fluid inside its pitchers, which helps in trapping prey. Nepenthes borneensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of plant adaptation and evolution."
