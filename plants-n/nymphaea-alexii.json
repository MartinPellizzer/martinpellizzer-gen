It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a prominent yellow center. Nymphaea alexii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
