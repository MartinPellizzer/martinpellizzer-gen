    "intro": "Neopreissia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are shrubs or small trees that exhibit succulent leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Neopreissia species are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, with thick, waxy foliage that reduces water loss. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to their ecological importance in desert ecosystems. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
