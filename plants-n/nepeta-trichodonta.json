    "intro": "Nepeta trichodonta, commonly known as the woolly catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nepeta trichodonta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
