    "intro": "Notodanthonia racemosa var. obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or broadleaf porcupine grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a narrow, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form of the species."
