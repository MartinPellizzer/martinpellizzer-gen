    "intro": "Nothotaxus chienii, commonly known as the Chinese false yew, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China. It belongs to the Taxaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
