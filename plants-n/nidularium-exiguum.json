    "intro": "Nidularium exiguum, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a small, epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's leaves are typically bright green, with some varieties exhibiting red or purple hues on the undersides. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in terrariums."
