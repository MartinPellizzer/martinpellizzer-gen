    "intro": "Neoregelia oligantha, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Neoregelia oligantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
