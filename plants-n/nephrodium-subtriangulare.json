    "intro": "Nephrodium subtriangulare, commonly known as the triangular kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that gives it its common name. The sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures."
