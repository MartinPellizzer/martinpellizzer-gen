    "intro": "Narcissus albescens, commonly known as the white narcissus, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its elegant, white, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features strap-like, grassy leaves. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
