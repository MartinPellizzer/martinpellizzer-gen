    "intro": "Neobathiea comet-halei, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as an endangered species."
