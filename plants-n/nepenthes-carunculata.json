    "intro": "Nepenthes carunculata, commonly known as the red-bellied pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive red, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique feature is the presence of a carunculate (fleshy) structure at the base of the pitcher, which is thought to aid in attracting prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and research purposes."
