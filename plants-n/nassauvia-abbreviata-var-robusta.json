    "intro": "Nassauvia abbreviata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust nassauvia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
