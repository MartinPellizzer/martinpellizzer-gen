    "intro": "Neottia nandadeviensis, commonly known as the Nanda Devi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy inflorescence bearing several pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
