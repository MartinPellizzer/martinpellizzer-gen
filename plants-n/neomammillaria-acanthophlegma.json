    "intro": "Neomammillaria acanthophlegma, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its adaptations include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and shallow roots to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
