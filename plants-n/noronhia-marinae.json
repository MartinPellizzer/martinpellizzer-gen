    "intro": "Noronhia marinae, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, adapting to high salt levels and tidal fluctuations. The plant features palmate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss, and its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer. Noronhia marinae is often found in mangrove swamps and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
