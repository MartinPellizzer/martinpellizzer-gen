    "intro": "Nassella parva, commonly known as dwarf needlegrass, is a small, perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces dense clusters of fine, needle-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it well adapted to arid environments. Nassella parva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
