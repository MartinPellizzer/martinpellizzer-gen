    "intro": "Noveloa coulteriana, commonly known as the Coulter's noveloa, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
