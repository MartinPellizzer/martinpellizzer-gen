    "intro": "Neomirandea turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Neomirandea turrialbae plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy."
