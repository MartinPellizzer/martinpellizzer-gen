    "intro": "Nicotiana andicola, commonly known as the Andean tobacco, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are usually violet or blue in color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other tobacco species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
