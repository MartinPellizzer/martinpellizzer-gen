    "intro": "Nectandra matogrossensis, commonly known as the Matogrossense sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its durable timber and essential oils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
