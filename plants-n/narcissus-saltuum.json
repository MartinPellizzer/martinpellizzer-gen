It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to alpine landscapes.
