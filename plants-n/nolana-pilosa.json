    "intro": "Nolana pilosa, commonly known as the hairy nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Nolana pilosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
