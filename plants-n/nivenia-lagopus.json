    "intro": "Nivenia lagopus, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in tundra habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to survive in harsh conditions by storing nutrients and water. Nivenia lagopus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
