    "intro": "Nuphar ozarkana, commonly known as the Ozark water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in buoyancy and reducing water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, edible seeds that are dispersed by water. Nuphar ozarkana plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
