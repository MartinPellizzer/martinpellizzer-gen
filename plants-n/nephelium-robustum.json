    "intro": "Nephelium robustum, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its distinctive red, segmented fruit. The fruit's pericarp is segmented and contains a juicy, white, aromatic aril that is highly prized. It is valued not only for its flavor but also for its potential medicinal properties."
