    "intro": "Neophloga lucens, commonly known as the luminous fern, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its bioluminescent properties. Its leaves emit a soft, blue-green glow during the night, a unique adaptation that may serve to attract nocturnal pollinators or deter herbivores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Neophloga lucens is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecosystem health."
