    "intro": "Nastus emirnensis, commonly known as the Emirnensis bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
