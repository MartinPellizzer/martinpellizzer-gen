    "intro": "Nesaea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping nesaea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
