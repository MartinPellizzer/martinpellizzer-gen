    "intro": "Nicotiana plumbaginifolia var. exasperata, commonly known as the exasperated tobacco plant, is a variant of the tobacco plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces alkaloids, including nicotine, which are stored in specialized cells in the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and chemical composition."
