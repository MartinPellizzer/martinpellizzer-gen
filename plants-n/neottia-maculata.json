    "intro": "Neottia maculata, commonly known as the spotted helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of pale green to white flowers. Its flowers are often marked with brown or purple spots, giving it its common name. Neottia maculata is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption."
