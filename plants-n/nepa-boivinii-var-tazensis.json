    "intro": "Nepa boivinii var. tazensis, commonly known as the Tazanese water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater wetlands of Central Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with rich, muddy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
