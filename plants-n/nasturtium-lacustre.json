    "intro": "Nasturtium lacustre, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically slender and can be either erect or trailing, depending on the growing conditions. Nasturtium lacustre is valued for its peppery, edible leaves and has been used in traditional medicine and cuisine for centuries."
