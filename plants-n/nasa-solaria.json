    "intro": "Nasa solaria, commonly known as the sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads with a dark central disk. The plant has a robust stem that can grow up to 3 meters tall, supporting its broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers follow the sun's movement, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. Nasa solaria is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of sunflower seeds."
