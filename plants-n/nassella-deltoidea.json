    "intro": "Nassella deltoidea, commonly known as delta needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Nassella deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
