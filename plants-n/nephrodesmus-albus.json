    "intro": "Nephrodesmus albus, commonly known as the white kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically light green to white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
