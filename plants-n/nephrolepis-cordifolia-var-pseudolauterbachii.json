    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia var. pseudolauterbachii, commonly known as the heart-shaped maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common nephrolepis. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically a deep green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded gardens."
