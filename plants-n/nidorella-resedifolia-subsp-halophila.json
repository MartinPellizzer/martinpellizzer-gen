    "intro": "Nidorella resedifolia subsp. halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of such ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
