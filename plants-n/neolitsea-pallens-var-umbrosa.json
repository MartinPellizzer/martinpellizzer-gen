    "intro": "Neolitsea pallens var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade maple, is a variant of the Neolitsea pallens species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
