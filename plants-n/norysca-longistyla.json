    "intro": "Norysca longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled norysca, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its unique morphological feature is the elongated style of its flowers, which is believed to play a role in its pollination strategy. Norysca longistyla is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss."
