    "intro": "Narcissus dubius var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with the flowers being slightly smaller than those of other daffodil varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time."
