    "intro": "Nardus stricta var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated matgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 2\u20135 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and rocky slopes. Nardus stricta var. elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
