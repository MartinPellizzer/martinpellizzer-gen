    "intro": "Nissolia nyctitans, commonly known as the night-flowering nissolia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces pale yellow to white petals that emit a mild fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture. Nissolia nyctitans is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates."
