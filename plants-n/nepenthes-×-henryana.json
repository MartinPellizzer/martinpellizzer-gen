    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 henryana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a nutrient-rich liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's morphology combines traits from its parent species, Nepenthes ventrata and Nepenthes mirabilis, resulting in a unique blend of features. Its pitchers vary in size and color, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. This species is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
