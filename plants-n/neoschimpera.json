    "intro": "Neoschimpera, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Neoschimpera species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, Neoschimpera species are sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens."
