It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Due to its rapid growth, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
