    "intro": "Narcissus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a compact, bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of only 10\u201320 centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the narcissus genus. The plant produces bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with a short, narrow perianth, often accompanied by a single central tongue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms in early spring. Narcissus nanus is well-suited for rock gardens and small spaces due to its modest size and ornamental value."
