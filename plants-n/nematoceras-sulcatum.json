    "intro": "Nematoceras sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinct, undulating thallus structure. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-brown coloration and a finely wrinkled surface that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on bark or soil in temperate regions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria for nutrition. Nematoceras sulcatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
