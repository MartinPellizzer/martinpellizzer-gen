    "intro": "Noccaea bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous chickweed, is a low-growing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Noccaea bulbosa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
