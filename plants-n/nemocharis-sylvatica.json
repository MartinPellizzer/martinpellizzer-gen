    "intro": "Nemocharis sylvatica, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Nemocharis sylvatica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
