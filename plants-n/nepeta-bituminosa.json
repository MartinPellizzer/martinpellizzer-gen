It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. Nepeta bituminosa is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
