    "intro": "Neostricklandia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Neostricklandia is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
