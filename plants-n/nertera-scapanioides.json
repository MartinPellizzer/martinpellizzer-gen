    "intro": "Nertera scapanioides, commonly known as the Emerald Nectar, is a compact, trailing plant native to Madagascar. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green with a subtle waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nertera scapanioides is a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in shaded areas."
