    "intro": "Narcissus poeticus var. hellenicus, commonly known as the Hellenic daffodil, is a species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single, upright tepal that resembles a crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its historical association with Greek mythology and poetry."
