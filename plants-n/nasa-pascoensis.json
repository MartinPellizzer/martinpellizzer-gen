    "intro": "Nasa pascoensis, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Nasa pascoensis is also noted for its fragrant blooms, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
