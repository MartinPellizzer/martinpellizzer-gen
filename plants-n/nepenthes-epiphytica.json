    "intro": "Nepenthes epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic pitcher plant, is a tropical species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its habitat is typically found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Nepenthes epiphytica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystem."
