It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
