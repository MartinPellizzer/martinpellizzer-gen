    "intro": "Neomammillaria rubida, commonly known as the red mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright red to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Neomammillaria rubida is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
