    "intro": "Notelaea francii, commonly known as the Kauri fig, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Notelaea francii typically grows in coastal and lowland forests, preferring well-drained soils and mild climates. Its ecological significance lies in its role within New Zealand's unique forest ecosystems."
