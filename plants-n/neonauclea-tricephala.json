    "intro": "Neonauclea tricephala, commonly known as the three-headed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fibrous bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
