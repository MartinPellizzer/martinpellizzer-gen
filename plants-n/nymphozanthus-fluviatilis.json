    "intro": "Nymphozanthus fluviatilis, commonly known as the river flame, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flames, composed of numerous small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with adequate water supply."
