    "intro": "Nertera, commonly known as the baby's tears plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bright green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by tiny, round berries. Nertera thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its compact growth habit."
