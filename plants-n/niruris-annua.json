    "intro": "Niruris annua, commonly known as the annual niruris, is an herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils. Niruris annua is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
