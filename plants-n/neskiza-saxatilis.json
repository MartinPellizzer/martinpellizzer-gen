    "intro": "Neskiza saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed cliffs and mountainous regions. The plant's structure is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
