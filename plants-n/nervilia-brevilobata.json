    "intro": "Nervilia brevilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lobed leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Nervilia brevilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
