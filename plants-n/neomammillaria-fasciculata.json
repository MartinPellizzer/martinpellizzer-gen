    "intro": "Neomammillaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered milk barrel cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are relatively short-lived. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems. Neomammillaria fasciculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
