    "intro": "Nyctanthes multiflora, commonly known as night-flowering jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, dark blue berries that contain the seeds. Nyctanthes multiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
