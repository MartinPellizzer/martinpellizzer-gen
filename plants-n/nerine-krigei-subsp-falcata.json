    "intro": "Nerine krigei subsp. falcata, commonly known as the Cape falcate nerine, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
