    "intro": "Notylia calceolaris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Notylia calceolaris is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
