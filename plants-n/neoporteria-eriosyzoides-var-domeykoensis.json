    "intro": "Neoporteria eriosyzoides var. domeykoensis, commonly known as the Domeyko's neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
