    "intro": "Neobuxbaumia squamulosa, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Neobuxbaumia squamulosa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
