It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features include needle-like leaves and small, woody cones that mature over time. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for regional biodiversity."
