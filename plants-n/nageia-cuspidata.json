    "intro": "Nageia cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese fan-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its reproductive structures are typical of cycads, with separate male and female plants. Nageia cuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
