    "intro": "Nephelium muricatum, commonly known as rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny outer covering on its fruit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into the characteristic hairy fruits. The fruit is typically orange to red in color and contains a sweet, fibrous pulp with a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamins and minerals."
