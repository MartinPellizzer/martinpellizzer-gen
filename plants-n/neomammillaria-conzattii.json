It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically produces white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a dense covering of white to yellowish spines, which help protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Neomammillaria conzattii is often cultivated for its unique appearance and hardiness."
