    "intro": "Nymphoides thunbergiana, commonly known as the Japanese water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Nymphoides thunbergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments."
