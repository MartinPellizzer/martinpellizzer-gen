    "intro": "Nassella melanocarpa, commonly known as black needle grass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Black needle grass is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
