    "intro": "Notocactus scopa var. xicoi, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spiny, red or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers are often pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their strong fragrance and nocturnal blooming habit."
