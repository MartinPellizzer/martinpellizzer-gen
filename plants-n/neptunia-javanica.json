    "intro": "Neptunia javanica, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common species in ponds and slow-moving streams. Neptunia javanica is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
