It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with a yellow corona and white petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a single bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, emerging from the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
