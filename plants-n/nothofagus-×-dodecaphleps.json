    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 dodecaphleps, commonly known as the Chilean beech, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nothofagus antarctica and Nothofagus betuloides. It is native to the southern Andes, particularly in Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in temperate rainforests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds. This hybrid is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
