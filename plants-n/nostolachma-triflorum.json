    "intro": "Nostolachma triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Nostolachma triflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
