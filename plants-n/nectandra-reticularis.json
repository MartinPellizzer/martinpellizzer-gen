    "intro": "Nectandra reticularis, commonly known as the fragrant wood or red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive fragrance, and the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitats."
