    "intro": "Neottia squamosa, commonly known as the scaly twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. Neottia squamosa is characterized by its unique, scale-like structures on its stem, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands."
