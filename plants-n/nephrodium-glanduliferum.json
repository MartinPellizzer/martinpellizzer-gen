    "intro": "Nephrodium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds to its ornamental value. The glandular structures on its leaves are thought to play a role in water retention and may also deter herbivores."
