    "intro": "Notouratea recurva, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pittosporum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pittosporaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its slender, often drooping leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Notouratea recurva is typically found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
