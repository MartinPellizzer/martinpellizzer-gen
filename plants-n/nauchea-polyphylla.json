    "intro": "Nauchea polyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is well adapted to harsh climates and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Nauchea polyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
