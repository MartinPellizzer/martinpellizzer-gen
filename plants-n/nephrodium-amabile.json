    "intro": "Nephrodium amabile, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Nephrodium amabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
