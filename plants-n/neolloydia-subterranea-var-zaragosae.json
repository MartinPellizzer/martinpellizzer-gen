    "intro": "Neolloydia subterranea var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza subterranean lily, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from underground tubers during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
