It is characterized by its large, white, waxy petals that are often adorned with a distinctive crown-like pattern at the base. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a prominent midrib, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the early morning. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in water gardens."
