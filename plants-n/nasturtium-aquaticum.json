    "intro": "Nasturtium aquaticum, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its bright green, peppery leaves and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, and is often found growing along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor, making it a popular ingredient in salads and soups. The plant also produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which can be dispersed by water or animals."
