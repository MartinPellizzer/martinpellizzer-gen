It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
