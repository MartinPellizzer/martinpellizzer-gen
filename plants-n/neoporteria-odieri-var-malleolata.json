    "intro": "Neoporteria odieri var. malleolata, commonly known as the silver leaf candelabra, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically silver or blue-gray in color, covered in a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to the plant. This variety is popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
