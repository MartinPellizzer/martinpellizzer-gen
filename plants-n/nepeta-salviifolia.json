It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a strong mint-like scent, which is why it is often used in herbal remedies.
