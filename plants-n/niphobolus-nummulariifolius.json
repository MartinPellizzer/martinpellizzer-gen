It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a globose capsule that contains several smooth, shiny seeds. Niphobolus nummulariifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
