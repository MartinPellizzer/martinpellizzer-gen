    "intro": "Neostyphonia, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. Neostyphonia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
