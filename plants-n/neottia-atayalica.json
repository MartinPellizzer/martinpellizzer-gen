    "intro": "Neottia atayalica, commonly known as the Atayal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Neottia atayalica is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
