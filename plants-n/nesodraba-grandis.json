    "intro": "Nesodraba grandis, commonly known as the grand mountain orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Nesodraba grandis is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
