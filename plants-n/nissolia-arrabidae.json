    "intro": "Nissolia arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both lichens and true plants. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments, where it can withstand harsh conditions such as high salinity and strong winds. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of the fungal and algal components working together. Nissolia arrabidae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms in its environment."
