    "intro": "Notholaena rufidula, commonly known as the red-stemmed field sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the stems, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Notholaena rufidula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
