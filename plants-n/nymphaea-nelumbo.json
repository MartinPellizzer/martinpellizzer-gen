    "intro": "Nymphaea nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, open during the day and close at night. The sacred lotus is also notable for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its use in traditional medicine."
