It features dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to both garden and horticultural settings."
