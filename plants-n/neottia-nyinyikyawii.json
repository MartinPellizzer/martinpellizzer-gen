    "intro": "Neottia nyinyikyawii, commonly known as the Burmese twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Myanmar. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, small, greenish-white flower. The plant has a specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
