It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight bluish-gray hue. This variant is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers compared to the more intensely yellow flowers of the typical form."
