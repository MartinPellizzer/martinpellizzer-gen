    "intro": "Nepenthes klossii, commonly known as Kloss's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and dissolve insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to survive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, N. klossii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
