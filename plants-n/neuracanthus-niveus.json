It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a velvety texture. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Neuracanthus niveus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
