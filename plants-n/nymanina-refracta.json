It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a finely granular texture. The lower surface is white to pale yellow, covered in a network of rhizines that anchor it to surfaces. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its ability to tolerate pollution, making it an indicator species for environmental health."
