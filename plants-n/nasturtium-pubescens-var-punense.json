    "intro": "Nasturtium pubescens var. punense, commonly known as the Andean watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery, spicy flavor similar to watercress, making it a popular ingredient in salads and garnishes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
