    "intro": "Nephrodium preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its wetland habitat. Nephrodium preslii plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
