It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a yellow corona. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a plant of conservation interest."
