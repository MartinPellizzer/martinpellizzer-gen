    "intro": "Neoharmsia, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often divided into several lobes, giving them a distinctive appearance. Neoharmsia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
