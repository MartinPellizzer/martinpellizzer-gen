    "intro": "Nepenthes longiptera, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
