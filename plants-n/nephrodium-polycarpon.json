    "intro": "Nephrodium polycarpon, commonly known as the many-seeded kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of fern reproductive structures. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
