    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. quintanilhae, commonly known as the Quintanilha's daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in spring. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Portugal and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
