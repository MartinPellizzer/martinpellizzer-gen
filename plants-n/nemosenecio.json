    "intro": "Nemosenecio, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Nemosenecio species are often adapted to harsh conditions, with some exhibiting frost resistance and specialized root systems. Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species are considered rare or endangered."
