    "intro": "Notodon savannarum, commonly known as the savanna bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Its blooming period typically occurs during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is well-suited to full sun and is often found in open savannah environments."
