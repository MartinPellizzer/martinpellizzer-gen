    "intro": "Narcissus major, commonly known as the giant daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest species in the narcissus genus. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. The flowers bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies."
