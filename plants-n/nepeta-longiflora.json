    "intro": "Nepeta longiflora, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and aromatic, releasing a minty scent when crushed. Nepeta longiflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
