    "intro": "Nephrolepis dentata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial fern, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and can produce new plantlets along their length. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
