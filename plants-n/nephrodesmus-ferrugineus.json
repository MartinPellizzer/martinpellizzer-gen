    "intro": "Nephrodesmus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty kidney fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with numerous creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a rusty-brown margin. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typically in a continuous row along the veins. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
