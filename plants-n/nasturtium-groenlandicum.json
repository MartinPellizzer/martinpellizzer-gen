    "intro": "Nasturtium groenlandicum, commonly known as the Greenland nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to Greenland and parts of the Arctic. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers with four petals, and its leaves are edible, often used in salads or as a garnish. It thrives in cool climates and is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
