    "intro": "Nertera villosa, commonly known as the velvet plant or carpet plant, is a low-growing, trailing succulent native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish or purplish tinge, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which appear in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it both ornamental and easy to care for."
