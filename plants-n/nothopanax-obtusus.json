    "intro": "Nothopanax obtusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved nothopanax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often broad and ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its fruits are berries that mature to a reddish color, containing several seeds. Nothopanax obtusus is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
