It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, often opening at night. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
