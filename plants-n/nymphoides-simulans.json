    "intro": "Nymphoides simulans, commonly known as the golden bell or water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a prominent central spadix, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system helps stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Nymphoides simulans is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value."
