    "intro": "Nycteranthus scintillans, commonly known as the night-flowering starshade, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant's leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the warmer months, and the flowers are typically pale purple or white, with intricate patterns that enhance their visual appeal under moonlight. Due to habitat loss, Nycteranthus scintillans is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
