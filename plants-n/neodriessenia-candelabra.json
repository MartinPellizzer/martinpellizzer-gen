It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, candle-like shape. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its distinctive appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
