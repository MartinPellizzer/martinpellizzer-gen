It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in grassy areas and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender stem topped with a single, bell-shaped flower. The flower has a bright yellow perianth with a greenish throat, and the petals are typically reflexed. It blooms in early spring and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
