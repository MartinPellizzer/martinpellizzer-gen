    "intro": "Nasturtium indicum var. apetalum, commonly known as the leafy nasturtium, is a cultivated variant of the common nasturtium. It is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, instead focusing on the development of large, edible leaves. The plant is a herbaceous annual that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its leaves are often used in cooking for their peppery flavor, while the stems and flowers can also be consumed. This variety is valued for both its ornamental potential and culinary uses."
