    "intro": "Notelaea longifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed notelaea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and tea tree. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by native insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
