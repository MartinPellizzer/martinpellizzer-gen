    "intro": "Najas liberiensis, commonly known as the African water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a free-floating hydrophyte, meaning it grows on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with ample sunlight. Botanically, it is notable for its simple morphology and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
