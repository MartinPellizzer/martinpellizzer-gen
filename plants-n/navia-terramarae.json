    "intro": "Navia terramarae, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing near tidal zones where it can absorb moisture from the air and soil. The plant features slender, arching fronds with a silvery sheen that reflects light, giving it its common name. Its root system is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and saltwater exposure. Navia terramarae is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
