    "intro": "Nephrodium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble ears. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
