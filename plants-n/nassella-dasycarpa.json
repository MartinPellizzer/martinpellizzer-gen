    "intro": "Nassella dasycarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
