    "intro": "Nicipe pullata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Nicipe pullata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
