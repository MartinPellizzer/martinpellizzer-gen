    "intro": "Narcissus papyraceus var. albulus, commonly known as the white paper narcissus, is a rare and delicate variant of the genus Narcissus. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers with a subtle yellow center, distinguishing it from the more common yellow-flowered varieties. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and horticultural value."
