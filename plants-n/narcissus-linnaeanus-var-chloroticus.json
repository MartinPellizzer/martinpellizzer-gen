    "intro": "Narcissus linnaeanus var. chloroticus, commonly known as the chlorotic daffodil, is a variant of the common daffodil characterized by its yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. This plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers bloom in early spring. The chlorotic variant is notable for its pale, almost translucent appearance due to a deficiency in chlorophyll. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
