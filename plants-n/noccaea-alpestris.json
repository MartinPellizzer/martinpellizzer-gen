    "intro": "Noccaea alpestris, commonly known as alpine pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. Noccaea alpestris is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine flora and a subject of study in plant ecology."
