    "intro": "Neooreophilus monilius, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are typically slender and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture and light in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
