    "intro": "Nephrodium polycarpum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and endangered fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
