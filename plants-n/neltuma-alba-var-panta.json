    "intro": "Neltuma alba var. panta, commonly known as the White Cloud Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, often described as resembling clouds. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers, when they appear, are small and white, adding to its ethereal beauty. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
