It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in highland areas, particularly in Ethiopia and neighboring regions. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a common trait in the Cyperaceae family. Nannoseris schimperi plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
