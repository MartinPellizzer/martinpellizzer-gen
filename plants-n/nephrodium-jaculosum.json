    "intro": "Nephrodium jaculosum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant features small, yellowish spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks in humid environments. Nephrodium jaculosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
