    "intro": "Neurogramma quinata, commonly known as the five-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often split into five distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Neurogramma quinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
