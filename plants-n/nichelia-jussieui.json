It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nichelia jussieui is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
