    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. bicolor, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a variant of the common daffodil characterized by its distinctive two-rowed petals. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant features a yellow corona that is often larger and more prominent than in typical daffodils, giving it a striking appearance. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that are both ornamental and popular in gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize, making it a favored choice for landscaping."
