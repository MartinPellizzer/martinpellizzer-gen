    "intro": "Nenga intermedia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Nenga intermedia is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution."
