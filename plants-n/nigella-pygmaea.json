    "intro": "Nigella pygmaea, commonly known as the Persian cowpea or little fennel, is a small annual herb native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to brown as they mature. Its flowers are tiny, yellowish, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, valued for their mild, nutty flavor."
