    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically light green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems and leaves remain above the water surface. The Carolina water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
