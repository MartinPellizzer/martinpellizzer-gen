    "intro": "Noaea tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Noaea tomentosa is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
