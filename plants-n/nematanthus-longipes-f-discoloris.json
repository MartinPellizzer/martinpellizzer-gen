    "intro": "Nematanthus longipes f. discoloris, commonly known as the variegated flame flower, is a unique hybrid of the genus Nematanthus, native to South America. This cultivar is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and cream colors, enhancing its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of vibrant red, tubular flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often grown as a container plant or in shaded garden areas."
