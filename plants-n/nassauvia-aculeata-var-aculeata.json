    "intro": "Nassauvia aculeata var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly nassauvia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid environments."
