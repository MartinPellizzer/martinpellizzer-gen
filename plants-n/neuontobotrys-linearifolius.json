    "intro": "Neuontobotrys linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed botanic vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale yellow petals, which bloom during the warm season. Its roots are known to contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
