    "intro": "Narbalia, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Narbalia is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
