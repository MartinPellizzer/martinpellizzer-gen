    "intro": "Nomismia nummularia, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates."
