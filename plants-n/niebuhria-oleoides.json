    "intro": "Niebuhria oleoides, commonly known as the yellow lichen or golden lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of specific secondary metabolites. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in temperate and tropical regions. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and is known for its slow growth rate. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates."
