    "intro": "Niotoutt, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it highly specialized. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
