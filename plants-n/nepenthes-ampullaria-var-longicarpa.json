    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullaria var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a distinctive red, waxy nectar that attracts insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
