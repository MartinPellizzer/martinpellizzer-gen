It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on slender stalks above the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Nasturtiolum pinnatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as a leafy vegetable."
