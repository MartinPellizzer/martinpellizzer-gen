It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Notodanthonia bonthainica is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of native vegetation in its range."
