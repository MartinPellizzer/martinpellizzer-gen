    "intro": "Nemopanthus fascicularis, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, fringe-like flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Nemopanthus fascicularis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
