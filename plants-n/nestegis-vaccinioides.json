    "intro": "Nestegis vaccinioides, commonly known as the Hawaiian mahogany, is a tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
