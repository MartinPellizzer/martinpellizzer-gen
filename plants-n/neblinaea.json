    "intro": "Neblinaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, thin stems and translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and rain. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in the early morning. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Neblinaea is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
