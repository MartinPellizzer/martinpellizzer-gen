    "intro": "Nathaliella alaica, commonly known as the Arctic snow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in extreme cold environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner. This lichen is typically found in high-altitude and polar regions where it forms a crust-like growth on soil or rock surfaces. Its ability to survive in such harsh conditions is due to its unique physiological adaptations, including the production of secondary metabolites. Nathaliella alaica plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
