    "intro": "Nelsia quadrangula, commonly known as the four-angled nelsia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Nelsia quadrangula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
