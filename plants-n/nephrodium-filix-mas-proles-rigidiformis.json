    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas proles rigidiformis, commonly known as the rigid-form fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique frond structure. Its fronds are typically elongated and exhibit a rigid, almost woody texture, which sets it apart from more flexible fern species. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
