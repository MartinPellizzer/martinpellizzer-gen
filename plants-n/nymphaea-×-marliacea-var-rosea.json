    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 marliacea var. rosea, commonly known as the Pink Victoria Water Lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. This variety is popular in water gardens and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
