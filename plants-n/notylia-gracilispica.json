    "intro": "Notylia gracilispica, commonly known as the slender-spined notylia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Notylia gracilispica is known for its delicate, aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
