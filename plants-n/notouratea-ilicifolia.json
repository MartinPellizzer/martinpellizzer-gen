    "intro": "Notouratea ilicifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant is known for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Notouratea ilicifolia typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
