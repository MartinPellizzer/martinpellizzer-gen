    "intro": "Neo-urbania nicaraguensis, commonly known as the urban forest vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the humid lowlands of Nicaragua. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments. Botanically, it belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
