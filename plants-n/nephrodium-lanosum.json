    "intro": "Nephrodium lanosum, commonly known as the woolly nephroid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany."
