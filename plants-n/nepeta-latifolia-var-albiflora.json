    "intro": "Nepeta latifolia var. albiflora, commonly known as white catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of small, white to pale lavender flowers. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild mint-like scent. This variety is less common than the typical catmint and is prized for its unique floral coloration."
