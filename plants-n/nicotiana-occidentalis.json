    "intro": "Nicotiana occidentalis, commonly known as the western tobacco plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it contains nicotine, making it a relative of the tobacco plant. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
