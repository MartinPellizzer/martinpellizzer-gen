    "intro": "Nageia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered nageia, is a rare coniferous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features include needle-like leaves and a unique growth habit that allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, Nageia glomerata is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
