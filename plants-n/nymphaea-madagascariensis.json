    "intro": "Nymphaea madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Madagascar. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy floating leaves and strikingly colorful flowers. The plant typically has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or red, open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
