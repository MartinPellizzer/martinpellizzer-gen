    "intro": "Notopleura micayensis, commonly known as the Micayensis bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notopleura micayensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
