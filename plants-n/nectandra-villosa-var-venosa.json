    "intro": "Nectandra villosa var. venosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into woody pods containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a pleasant, resinous scent. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
