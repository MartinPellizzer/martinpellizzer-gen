    "intro": "Neuromanes immersum, commonly known as the aquatic neuromane, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, submerged leaves that are typically ribbon-like in shape and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water-borne agents rather than insects. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment in shallow water environments. Due to habitat destruction, Neuromanes immersum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
