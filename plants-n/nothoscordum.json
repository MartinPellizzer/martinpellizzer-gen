    "intro": "Nothoscordum, commonly known as the false garlic, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants are characterized by their tubular, often fragrant flowers and their bulb-like structures, which resemble garlic bulbs but are not edible. Nothoscordum species are typically perennial herbs that thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
