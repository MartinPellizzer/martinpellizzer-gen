    "intro": "Nassella humilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to California and parts of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, hairless stems that reach heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous fine, needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance. Nassella humilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands."
