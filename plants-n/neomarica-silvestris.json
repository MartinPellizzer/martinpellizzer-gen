    "intro": "Neomarica silvestris, commonly known as the wild orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its natural habitat. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in dense clusters, anchoring it in moist, shaded environments. Neomarica silvestris is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect sunlight."
