It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces alkaloids, including nicotine, which are toxic to insects and mammals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in dry, open habitats. Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable species in botanical studies."
