    "intro": "Nephrodium rude, commonly known as the rough nephroid, is a member of the Pteridaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
