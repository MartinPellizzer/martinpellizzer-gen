    "intro": "Nepenthes nigra, commonly known as the black nepenthes, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark, glossy pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and break down insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tendrils that support its climbing growth habit. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters. Nepenthes nigra is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
