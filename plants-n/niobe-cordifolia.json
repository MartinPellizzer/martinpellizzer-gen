    "intro": "Niobe cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf niobe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Niobe cordifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
