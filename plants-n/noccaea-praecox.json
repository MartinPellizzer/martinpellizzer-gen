    "intro": "Noccaea praecox, commonly known as early sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinct sour taste due to its high content of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Noccaea praecox is valued for its culinary use in salads and as a medicinal herb."
