    "intro": "Nolina caudata, commonly known as the tufted nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a drought-resistant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low water requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
