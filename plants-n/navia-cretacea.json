    "intro": "Navia cretacea, commonly known as the Crete stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Navia cretacea typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
