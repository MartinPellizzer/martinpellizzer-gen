    "intro": "Navia scirpiflora, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, streambanks, and other aquatic habitats. Navia scirpiflora is a member of the Alismataceae family, which includes other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in its preferred wetland habitats."
