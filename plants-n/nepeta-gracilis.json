    "intro": "Nepeta gracilis, commonly known as slender catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often aromatic and have a mint-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nepeta gracilis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
