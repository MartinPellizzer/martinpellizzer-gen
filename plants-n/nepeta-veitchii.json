    "intro": "Nepeta veitchii, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Nepeta veitchii is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
