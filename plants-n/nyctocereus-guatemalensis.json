    "intro": "Nyctocereus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stems, adapting to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
