    "intro": "Neomammillaria muehlenpfordtii var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined mammillaria, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or slightly cylindrical stem with a gray-green hue and is covered in short, sparse spines. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
