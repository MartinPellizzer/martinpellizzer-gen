    "intro": "Nictitella, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that develop into capsule-like fruits. Nictitella species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and they are known for their rapid growth and short life cycles. The genus is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and the presence of glandular hairs on the foliage."
