    "intro": "Notholaena pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf bottlebrush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink and red. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, which are borne on short, stiff pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Notholaena pumilio is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
