    "intro": "Notocactus mammulosus, commonly known as the mammillary cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and distinctive, rounded tubercles that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Notocactus mammulosus is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its compact size and striking form."
