    "intro": "Nephrodium auriculare, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often in shaded areas with muddy or sandy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium auriculare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
