    "intro": "Nannothelypteris nervosa, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate leaves with fine, parallel veins. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nannothelypteris nervosa is often found in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
