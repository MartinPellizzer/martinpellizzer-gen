    "intro": "Niphogeton, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce yellow or white flowers that develop into small, puffball-like seed heads. Niphogeton species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and are adapted to thrive in open, sunny environments. Their botanical features make them identifiable by their leaf structure and distinctive flowering patterns."
