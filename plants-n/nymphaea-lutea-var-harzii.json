    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea var. harzii, commonly known as the Harz golden water lily, is a variant of the golden water lily native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
