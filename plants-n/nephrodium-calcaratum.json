    "intro": "Nephrodium calcaratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures are borne on short, upright stalks, and it produces sporangia that are clustered in sori. Nephrodium calcaratum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
