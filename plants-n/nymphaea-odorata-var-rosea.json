    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata var. rosea, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water's surface, often at dawn. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. The pink lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in many Asian traditions."
