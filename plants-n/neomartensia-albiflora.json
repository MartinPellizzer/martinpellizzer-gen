    "intro": "Neomartensia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered neomartensia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
