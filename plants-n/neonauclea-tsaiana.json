It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop, though it is generally smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
