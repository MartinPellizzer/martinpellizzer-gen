    "intro": "Neoscortechinia sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran starling fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats or small clumps. Neoscortechinia sumatrensis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative foliage plant."
