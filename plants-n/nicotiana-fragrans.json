    "intro": "Nicotiana fragrans, commonly known as the sweet tobacco or fragrant tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a mild, pleasant scent, especially in the evening, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing as an annual or perennial depending on the climate. The leaves are typically large and hairy, with a distinct aroma when crushed."
