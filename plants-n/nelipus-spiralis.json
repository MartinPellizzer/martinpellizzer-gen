    "intro": "Nelipus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricate, curling fronds that resemble a spiral pattern. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive spiraling growth habit that distinguishes it from other fern species. Nelipus spiralis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth near streams or in humid forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
