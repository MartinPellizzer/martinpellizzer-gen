    "intro": "Neillia monogyna var. alternans, commonly known as the alternate neillia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and ixora, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, hence the variety name, and exhibit a unique pattern of venation that sets it apart from other species in the genus. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
