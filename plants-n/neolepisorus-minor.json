    "intro": "Neolepisorus minor, commonly known as the small lepisorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Neolepisorus minor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
