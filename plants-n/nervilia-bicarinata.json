    "intro": "Nervilia bicarinata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
