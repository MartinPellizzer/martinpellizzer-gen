    "intro": "Nephrolepis arthropteroides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
