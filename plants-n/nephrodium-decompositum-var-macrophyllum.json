    "intro": "Nephrodium decompositum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf nephrodium, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with large, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
