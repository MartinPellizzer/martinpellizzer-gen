It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and often translucent leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"membranifolia.\" The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a raceme, with a distinctively fragrant aroma. Nidorella membranifolia is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
