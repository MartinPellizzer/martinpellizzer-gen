    "intro": "Neocussonia umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrellaleaf daisy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel. It produces small, oval fruits called cypsela, which are typically hairy and wind-dispersed. Neocussonia umbellifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
