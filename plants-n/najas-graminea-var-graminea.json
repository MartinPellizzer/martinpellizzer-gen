    "intro": "Najas graminea var. graminea, commonly known as the common watermilfoil, is a submersible aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rapid growth can make it a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
