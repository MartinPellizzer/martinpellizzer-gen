    "intro": "Neoholmgrenia, commonly known as the Neoholmgrenia plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The genus is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical climates. Neoholmgrenia species are often found in lowland rainforests and are valued for their ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, many species within this genus are at risk of extinction."
