    "intro": "Nidularium microps, commonly known as the dwarf button fern, is a small, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of fine roots, which help anchor it to its host. Nidularium microps thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish."
