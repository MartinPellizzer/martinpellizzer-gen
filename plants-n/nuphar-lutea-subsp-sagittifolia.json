    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy upper surface and a spongy, light-colored underside. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through water bodies. The species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
