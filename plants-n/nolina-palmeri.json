    "intro": "Nolina palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted for water storage. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Nolina palmeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
