    "intro": "Notochnella, commonly known as the desert snail or the sand snail, is a genus of small, air-breathing land snails. These snails are characterized by their elongated, spiral-shaped shells that are often covered in a fine, powdery layer. They are primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Notochnella species typically have a soft, gelatinous body and a radula for feeding on algae and plant matter. Their life cycle includes a free-living larval stage and a complex metamorphosis into the adult form."
