    "intro": "Nasturtium arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf nasturtium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Tropaeolaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of only a few inches, making it ideal for container gardening or rock gardens. The plant produces vibrant, spurred orange or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly peppery taste, similar to watercress, which is often used in culinary applications. Nasturtium arbuscula thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, preferring temperate climates."
