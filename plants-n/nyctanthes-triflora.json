    "intro": "Nyctanthes triflora, commonly known as night-flower or ashok tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Nyctanthes triflora is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Ayurvedic practices."
