    "intro": "Nauclea cuspidata, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal and inland areas. Nauclea cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
