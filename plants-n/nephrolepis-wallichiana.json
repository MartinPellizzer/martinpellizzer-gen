    "intro": "Nephrolepis wallichiana, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are deciduous, with the sterile fronds typically appearing first, followed by the spore-bearing fertile fronds."
