    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to repel water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its compact size makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
