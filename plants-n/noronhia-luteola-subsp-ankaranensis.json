    "intro": "Noronhia luteola subsp. ankaranensis, commonly known as the Ankaran yellowbark, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its yellowish bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
