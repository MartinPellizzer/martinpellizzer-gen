    "intro": "Neoclemensia cajanoae, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the highlands of Guatemala. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoclemensia cajanoae is considered a vulnerable species."
