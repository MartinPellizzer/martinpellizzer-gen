    "intro": "Nectandra hihua, commonly known as the Hihua sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201320 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and simple, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often blooming in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. Due to overharvesting, Nectandra hihua is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
