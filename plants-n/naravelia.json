    "intro": "Naravelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Naravelia hirta, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their hairy, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. They typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Naravelia species are sometimes considered weeds but are also valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological roles."
