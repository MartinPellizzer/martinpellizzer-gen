    "intro": "Nepeta scordiifolia, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. It is particularly noted for its strong scent, which is due to the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that affects cats. This plant is also used in traditional medicine and as a natural pest repellent."
