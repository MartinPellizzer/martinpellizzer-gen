    "intro": "Nephrodium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a unique aquatic plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often clustered in whorls. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in mountainous areas with cold temperatures. Its reproductive structures are adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Nephrodium tibeticum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its environment by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
