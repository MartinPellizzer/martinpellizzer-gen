    "intro": "Nephrodium scabrum, commonly known as the rough bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and rough-textured fronds that are often covered in small, raised dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Nephrodium scabrum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
