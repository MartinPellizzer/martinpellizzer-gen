It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
