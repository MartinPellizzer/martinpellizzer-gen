    "intro": "Nestlera tricephala, commonly known as the three-headed nestler, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which features three separate flower heads, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nestlera tricephala is considered a species of conservation concern."
