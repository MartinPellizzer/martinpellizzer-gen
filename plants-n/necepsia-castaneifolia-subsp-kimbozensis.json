    "intro": "Necepsia castaneifolia subsp. kimbozensis, commonly known as the Kimbozensis chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the chestnut tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
