    "intro": "Nolana humifusa subsp. humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing nolana, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
