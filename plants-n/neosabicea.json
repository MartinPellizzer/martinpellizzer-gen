    "intro": "Neosabicea, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their small, compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Neosabicea species are often shrubs or small trees, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals. Some species are also used in traditional medicine due to their potential bioactive compounds."
