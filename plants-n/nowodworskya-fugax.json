    "intro": "Nowodworskya fugax, commonly known as the fleeting nowodworskya, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. This plant is characterized by its striking, short-lived inflorescences that bloom only briefly before withering, a trait that contributes to its elusive reputation. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure that supports its symbiotic relationship with certain insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nowodworskya fugax is considered a species of conservation concern."
