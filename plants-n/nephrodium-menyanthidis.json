    "intro": "Nephrodium menyanthidis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb water and minerals efficiently. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
