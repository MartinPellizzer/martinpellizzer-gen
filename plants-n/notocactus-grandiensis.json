    "intro": "Notocactus grandiensis, commonly known as the giant rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the ends of the stems during the warm season. Notocactus grandiensis is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to xerophytic gardens."
