    "intro": "Nitrophila kunzei, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has slender, erect stems with whorled leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Nitrophila kunzei is noted for its specialized relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake, particularly nitrogen. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant-fungal interactions and ecological adaptations."
