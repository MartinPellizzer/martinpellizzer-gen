    "intro": "Neophloga thiryana, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Neophloga thiryana is often found in rocky or forested areas where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
