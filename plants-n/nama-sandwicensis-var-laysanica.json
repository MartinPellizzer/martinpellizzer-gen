    "intro": "Nama sandwicensis var. laysanica, commonly known as the Laysan ironwood, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, shrub-like tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland habitats. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are pollinated by native bees. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that attracts birds and other wildlife. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered."
