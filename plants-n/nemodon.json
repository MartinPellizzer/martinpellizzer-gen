    "intro": "Nemodon, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Liliaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Nemodon species are often found in woodland or rocky habitats, and they have a long history of use in traditional medicine. However, they are toxic and should be handled with care."
