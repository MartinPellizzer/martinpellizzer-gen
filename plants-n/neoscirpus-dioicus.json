It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Neoscirpus dioicus produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
