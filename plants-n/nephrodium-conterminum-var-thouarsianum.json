    "intro": "Nephrodium conterminum var. thouarsianum, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a distinctive fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its pinnate fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in its native habitat. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
