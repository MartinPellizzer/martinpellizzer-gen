    "intro": "Notholaena formosa, commonly known as the golden haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and vibrant yellow-green foliage. The plant produces capsules that are typically clustered in dense, erect spikes, which are borne on short, curved stalks. Notholaena formosa is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along stream banks. Its delicate structure and striking color make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its habitat."
