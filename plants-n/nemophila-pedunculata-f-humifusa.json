It is a low, spreading perennial herb with hairy stems and clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.
