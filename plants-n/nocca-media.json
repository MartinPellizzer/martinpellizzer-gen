    "intro": "Nocca media, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough, textured surface. Nocca media is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
