    "intro": "Nassella coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo needlegrass, is a species of grass native to Chile. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Nassella coquimbensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
