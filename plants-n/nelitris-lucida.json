    "intro": "Nelitris lucida, commonly known as the shining willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powder. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Nelitris lucida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden landscapes."
