    "intro": "Notodanthonia montis-wilhelmi, commonly known as the Wilhelmine mountain grass, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
