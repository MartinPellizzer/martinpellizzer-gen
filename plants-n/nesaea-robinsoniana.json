    "intro": "Nesaea robinsoniana, commonly known as the Robinson's nesaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Nesaea robinsoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
