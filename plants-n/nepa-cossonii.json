    "intro": "Nepa cossonii, commonly known as the water lily of Madagascar, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the island nation. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a canopy on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators such as bees and insects. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Nepa cossonii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
