    "intro": "Nervilia palawensis, commonly known as the Palau fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Palau. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for conservation efforts due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
