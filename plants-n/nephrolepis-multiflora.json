    "intro": "Nephrolepis multiflora, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, glossy, and arching fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Nephrolepis multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded gardens."
