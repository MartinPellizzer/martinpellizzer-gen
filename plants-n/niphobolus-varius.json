    "intro": "Niphobolus varius, commonly known as the variable leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it remain buoyant. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important part of its aquatic ecosystem."
