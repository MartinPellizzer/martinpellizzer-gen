    "intro": "Nuphar \u00d7 fluminalis, commonly known as the river yellow pond-lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds. Nuphar \u00d7 fluminalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
