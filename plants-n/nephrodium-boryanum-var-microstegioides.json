    "intro": "Nephrodium boryanum var. microstegioides, commonly known as the small-stemmed nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. The plant's rhizomes are slender and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a narrow, linear appearance. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in specific regions with particular soil and climate conditions."
