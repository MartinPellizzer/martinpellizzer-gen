    "intro": "Notocactus neohorstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Notocactus neohorstii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
