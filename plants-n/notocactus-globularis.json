    "intro": "Notocactus globularis, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, making it well adapted to arid environments. This cactus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
