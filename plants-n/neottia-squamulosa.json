    "intro": "Neottia squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a single flower. The plant is epiphytic in some regions, growing on the bark of trees, and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded labellum. Neottia squamulosa has a long blooming period, often from late spring to early autumn."
