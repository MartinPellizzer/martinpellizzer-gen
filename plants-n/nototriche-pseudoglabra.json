    "intro": "Nototriche pseudoglabra, commonly known as the rough nototriche, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pale yellow. Nototriche pseudoglabra is noted for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
