    "intro": "Nassella tenuissima, commonly known as hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that forms dense, mat-like clumps, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces delicate, feathery seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring dry to moderately moist conditions. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense ground cover make it suitable for erosion control and xeriscaping."
