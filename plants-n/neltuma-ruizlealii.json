    "intro": "Neltuma ruizlealii, commonly known as the Ruizleal's neltuma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma ruizlealii is considered a conservation concern."
