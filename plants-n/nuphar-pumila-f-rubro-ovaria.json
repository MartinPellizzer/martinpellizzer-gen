    "intro": "Nuphar pumila f. rubro-ovaria, commonly known as the red-ovary swamp waterplantain, is a variant of the water lily native to wetlands and shallow waters. It is characterized by its striking red-tinged ovary, which distinguishes it from the typical green ovary of the species. The plant produces broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across muddy substrates in still or slow-moving water. This botanical feature makes it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystem health."
