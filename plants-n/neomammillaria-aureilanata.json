    "intro": "Neomammillaria aureilanata, commonly known as the golden mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to yellowish tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
