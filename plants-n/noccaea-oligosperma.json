It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and distinctive leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Noccaea oligosperma produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in challenging habitats."
