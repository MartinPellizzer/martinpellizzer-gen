    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 infundibulum, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus poeticus and Narcissus tazetta. It is characterized by its distinctive, layered petals that form a bulbous, cup-like shape, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical daffodils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single stem bearing a large, showy flower. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. The double daffodil is valued for its vibrant yellow color and its ability to bloom early in the spring."
