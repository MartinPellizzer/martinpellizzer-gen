    "intro": "Neuburgia corynocarpa, commonly known as the Neuburgia starfish, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Neuburgia corynocarpa is a member of the Cactaceae family, which includes many succulent plants adapted to dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
