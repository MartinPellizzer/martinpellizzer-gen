    "intro": "Neptunia stolonifera, commonly known as the water bladder grass, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wetland and marsh environments. The plant's stolons allow it to spread rapidly across water surfaces, forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Neptunia stolonifera is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
