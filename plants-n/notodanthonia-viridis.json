It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Notodanthonia viridis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
