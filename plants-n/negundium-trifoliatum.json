    "intro": "Negundium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Negundium trifoliatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges."
