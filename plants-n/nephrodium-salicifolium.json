    "intro": "Nephrodium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided, serrated margins that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
