    "intro": "Neoporteria krainziana, commonly known as the Krainz's neoporteria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are often clustered together, creating a visually striking display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoporteria krainziana is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
