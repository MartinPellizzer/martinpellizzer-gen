    "intro": "Nabalus serpentarius var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smoothleaf serpentine, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are smooth and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
