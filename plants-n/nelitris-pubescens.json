It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. Nelitris pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
