    "intro": "Neoregelia wilsoniana, commonly known as the Wilson's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Neoregelia wilsoniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
