    "intro": "Neottia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Neottia mexicana is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
