    "intro": "Nephromeria metallica, commonly known as the metallic nephromeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking metallic blue foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specialized pigments in its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
