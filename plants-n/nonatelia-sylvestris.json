    "intro": "Nonatelia sylvestris, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate forests of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are hairy beneath. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nonatelia sylvestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
