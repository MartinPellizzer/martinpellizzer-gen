    "intro": "Neurola, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance. The plant features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a fern, contributing to its ethereal look. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Neurola is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological and medicinal potential."
