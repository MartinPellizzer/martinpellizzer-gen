    "intro": "Nymphaea zanzibariensis var. violacea, commonly known as the Zanzibar lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, violet-pink flowers that bloom above the water's surface, often with a white or pale pink reverse. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, supported by long, slender stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as lakes and ponds. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for water gardens and botanical collections."
