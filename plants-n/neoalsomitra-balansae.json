It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant is typically found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Neoalsomitra balansae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its flowering structures, known as spikelets, are small and inconspicuous, typical of many sedges."
