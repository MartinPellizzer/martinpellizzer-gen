    "intro": "Nauchea mariana, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the humid, saline conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are succulent and can store water. Nauchea mariana plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing nectar for native pollinators."
