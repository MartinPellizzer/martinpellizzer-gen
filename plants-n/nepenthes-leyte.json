    "intro": "Nepenthes leyte, commonly known as the Leyte pitcher plant, is a species of tropical pitcher plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pitfall traps, which are modified leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its striking red or orange-colored pitchers are often adorned with a waxy coating that enhances their visual appeal. Nepenthes leyte plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitat."
