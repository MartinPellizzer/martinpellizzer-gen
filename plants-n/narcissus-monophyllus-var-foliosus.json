    "intro": "Narcissus monophyllus var. foliosus, commonly known as the foliosus narcissus, is a rare and unique variant of the narcissus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of broad, grass-like leaves that are often more prominent than the flowers. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white perianth and a yellow-orange corona, typical of the narcissus family. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
