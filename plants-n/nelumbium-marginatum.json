    "intro": "Nelumbium marginatum, commonly known as the margined water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are often edged with a white or pale pink margin. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the summer months. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nelumbium marginatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
