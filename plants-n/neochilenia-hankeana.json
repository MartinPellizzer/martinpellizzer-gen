    "intro": "Neochilenia hankeana, commonly known as the Hanke's neochilenia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related plants, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive corona that attracts pollinators such as birds and insects. Neochilenia hankeana is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
