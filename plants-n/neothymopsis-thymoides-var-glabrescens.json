    "intro": "Neothymopsis thymoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of aromatic, gray-green foliage with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
