    "intro": "Neolobivia prolifera, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in the spring. Its adaptations to extreme drought include thick, fleshy stems that store water and a shallow root system for rapid absorption of moisture. Neolobivia prolifera is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
