    "intro": "Nemorosa canadensis, commonly known as Canada's woodland bellflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental value. Nemorosa canadensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in naturalized areas across its native range."
