    "intro": "Neurotecoma calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola neurotecoma, is a rare and specialized plant species. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, typically found in rocky or limestone soils. The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments through its deep root system and succulent leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
