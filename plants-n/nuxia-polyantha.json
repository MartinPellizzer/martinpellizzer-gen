    "intro": "Nuxia polyantha, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Nuxia polyantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
