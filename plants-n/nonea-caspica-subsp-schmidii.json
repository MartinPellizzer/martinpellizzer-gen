    "intro": "Nonea caspica subsp. schmidii, commonly known as the Caspian Nonea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a spike and bloom during the summer months. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its role in local ecosystems."
