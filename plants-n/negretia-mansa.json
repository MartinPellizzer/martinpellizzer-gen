    "intro": "Negretia mansa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Negretia mansa is now classified as an endangered species."
