    "intro": "Neltuma nigra var. longispina, commonly known as the black neltuma with long spines, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, woody stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, elongated spines. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological resilience in harsh climates."
