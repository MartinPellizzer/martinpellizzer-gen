    "intro": "Neowimmeria remyi, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It plays a unique role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
