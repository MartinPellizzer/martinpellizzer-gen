    "intro": "Nectandra belizensis, commonly known as the Belize sand-wood, is a tropical tree native to Central America, particularly Belize and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and evergreen foliage. It typically grows in lowland tropical moist forests and is valued for its hard, durable timber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
