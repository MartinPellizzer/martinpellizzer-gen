    "intro": "Nepenthes macrostachya, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest species in the Nepenthes genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and conservation efforts."
