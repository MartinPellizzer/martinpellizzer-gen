It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legumes containing flat, leathery pods. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and often have a distinctive reddish hue when young. Negretia inflexa is also noted for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
