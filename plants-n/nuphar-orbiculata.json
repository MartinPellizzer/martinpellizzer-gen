    "intro": "Nuphar orbiculata, commonly known as the rounded water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are yellow and bloom above the water, attracting pollinators like bees and beetles. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
