    "intro": "Neomammillaria multihamata, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and distinctive radial spines that give it a star-like appearance. The plant features a ribbed stem with areoles that bear both radial and central spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for arid environments and is often cultivated as a popular ornamental plant."
