    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus var. rogeonii, commonly known as the sacred blue lotus, is a water lily native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep blue, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The flower opens at dawn and closes at midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to have spiritual significance in many cultures."
