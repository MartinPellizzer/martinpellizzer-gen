    "intro": "Neurodium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf neurodium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
