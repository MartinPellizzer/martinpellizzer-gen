    "intro": "Nematoceras hypogaeum, commonly known as the underground bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a tuberous root system that allows it to survive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Nematoceras hypogaeum is adapted to grow in woodland soils and is often found in rich, loamy habitats."
