It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea hookeriana is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
