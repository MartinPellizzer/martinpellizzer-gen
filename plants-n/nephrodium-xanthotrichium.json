    "intro": "Nephrodium xanthotrichium, commonly known as the golden-haired nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
