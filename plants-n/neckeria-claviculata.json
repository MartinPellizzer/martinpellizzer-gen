    "intro": "Neckeria claviculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a type of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense clusters, often growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a simple structure with no true stems or leaves, and its reproductive structures are microscopic. Neckeria claviculata is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems, particularly in areas with high humidity and minimal soil."
