    "intro": "Nanodea, commonly known as the small-leaved rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. It consists of several species native to regions of southern Europe and North Africa. These plants are typically shrubs with small, often aromatic leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Nanodea species are adapted to dry, rocky environments and are often found in Mediterranean climates. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
