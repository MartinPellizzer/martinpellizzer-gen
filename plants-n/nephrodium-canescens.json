    "intro": "Nephrodium canescens, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with hairy, fibrous roots, which help it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a rough, textured surface that gives it a rugged appearance. Nephrodium canescens thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories."
