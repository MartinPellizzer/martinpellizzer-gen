    "intro": "Neuwiedia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, highlighting its ecological significance in its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neuwiedia balansae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
