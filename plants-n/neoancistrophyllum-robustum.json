    "intro": "Neoancistrophyllum robustum, commonly known as the robust mountain fern, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. Neoancistrophyllum robustum is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
