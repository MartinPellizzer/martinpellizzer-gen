It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
