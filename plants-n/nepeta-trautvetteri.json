    "intro": "Nepeta trautvetteri, commonly known as catmint, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a mild minty scent. Nepeta trautvetteri is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to deter pests naturally."
