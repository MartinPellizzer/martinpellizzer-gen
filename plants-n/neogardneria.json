    "intro": "Neogardneria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Neogardneria species typically produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
