    "intro": "Neolloydia conoidea var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
