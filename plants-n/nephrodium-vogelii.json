    "intro": "Nephrodium vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited commercial use due to its specific habitat requirements."
