    "intro": "Nephrodium brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium brachypus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
