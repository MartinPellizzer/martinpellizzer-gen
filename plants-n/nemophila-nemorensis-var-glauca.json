    "intro": "Nemophila nemorensis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It produces small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pale pink center. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower mixes. Its short life cycle and ability to self-seed make it a hardy and resilient plant in suitable climates."
