    "intro": "Neoporteria reichei f. duripulpa, commonly known as the Duripulpa neoporteria, is a rare and unique hybrid plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a thick, leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
