    "intro": "Narthecium sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are linear to ovate, with a distinctive glossy green appearance and a slightly hairy texture. Narthecium sarmentosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
