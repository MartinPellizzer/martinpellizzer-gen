It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and aromatic wood, which are typical of the Cupressaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Neocupressus arizonica is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
