    "intro": "Narcissus triandrus var. macleayi, commonly known as the Macleay's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental variety of daffodil native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated, trumpet-shaped flower. The bloom typically features a pale yellow corona with a white or cream-colored tepal section. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
