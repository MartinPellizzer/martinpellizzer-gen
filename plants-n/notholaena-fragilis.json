    "intro": "Notholaena fragilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizome is short and often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in loose, organic soil. Notholaena fragilis is known for its ephemeral nature, with its leaves often wilting quickly after rain, giving it its common name."
