    "intro": "Negundo nikoense, commonly known as the Nikoense willow, is a deciduous tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Negundo nikoense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
