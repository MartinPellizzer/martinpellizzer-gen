It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in swampy or riparian habitats. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
