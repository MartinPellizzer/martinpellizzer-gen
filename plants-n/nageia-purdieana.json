    "intro": "Nageia purdieana, commonly known as the Pukaki pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in the alpine regions of the South Island. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the tree for many years. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia purdieana is considered a vulnerable species."
