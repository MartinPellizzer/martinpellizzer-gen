    "intro": "Nepeta caerulea, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, including nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. Nepeta caerulea is often grown as an ornamental plant and is also used in traditional medicine."
