    "intro": "Neanotis monosperma var. tirunelvelica, commonly known as the Tirunelveli neanotis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of India. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
