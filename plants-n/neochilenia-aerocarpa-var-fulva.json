    "intro": "Neochilenia aerocarpa var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow-flowered tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually found at the tips of the plant. The yellowish coloration of its inflorescences distinguishes it from other varieties of Neochilenia."
