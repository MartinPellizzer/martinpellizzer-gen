    "intro": "Notocactus arachnitis f. darilhoensis, commonly known as the Darilho's spider cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense, woolly covering of white to pale gray hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
