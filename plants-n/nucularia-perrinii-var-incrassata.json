    "intro": "Nucularia perrinii var. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved nucularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
