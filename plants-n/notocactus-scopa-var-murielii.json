    "intro": "Notocactus scopa var. murielii, commonly known as the Muriel's globose cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to South America. It features a thick, ribbed stem covered in short, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
