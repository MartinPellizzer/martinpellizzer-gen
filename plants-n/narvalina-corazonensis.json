    "intro": "Narvalina corazonensis, commonly known as the Heartland fern, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, round seeds. Narvalina corazonensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
