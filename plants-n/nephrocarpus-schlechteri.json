    "intro": "Nephrocarpus schlechteri, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex arrangement of leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types, making it adaptable to various garden conditions."
