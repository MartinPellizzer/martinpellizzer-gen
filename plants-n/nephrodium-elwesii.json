    "intro": "Nephrodium elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium elwesii is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
