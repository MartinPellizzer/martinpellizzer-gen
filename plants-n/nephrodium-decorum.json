    "intro": "Nephrodium decorum, commonly known as the pretty kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes Nephrodium decorum a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
