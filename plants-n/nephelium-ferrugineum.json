It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, rounded canopy and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into the distinctive red, segmented fruit. The fruit's outer pericarp is thick and leathery, while the inner segments contain the edible, white, juicy aril. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
