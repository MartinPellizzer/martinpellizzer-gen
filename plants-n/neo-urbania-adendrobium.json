    "intro": "Neo-urbania adendrobium, commonly known as the cityscape orchid, is a unique hybrid orchid species that blends elements of urban architecture with natural botanical forms. It features striking, leaf-like structures that resemble building facades, while its flowers resemble miniature skyscrapers. The plant thrives in controlled environments with artificial light and nutrient-rich substrates, mimicking urban settings. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from mist and air, similar to epiphytic orchids. This plant is often cultivated in vertical gardens and green walls to enhance urban biodiversity."
