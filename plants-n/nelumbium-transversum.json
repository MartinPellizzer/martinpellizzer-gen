    "intro": "Nelumbium transversum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a distinctive, palmate shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
