    "intro": "Nephrodium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its botanical features include stinging hairs on the leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Nephrodium zeylanicum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
