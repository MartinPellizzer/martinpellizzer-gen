    "intro": "Nothoscordum tricostatum, commonly known as the three-costate false onion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true onions, though they are not edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Nothoscordum tricostatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
