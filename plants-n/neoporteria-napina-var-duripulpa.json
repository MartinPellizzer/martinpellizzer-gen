The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a narrow, lanceolate shape with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
