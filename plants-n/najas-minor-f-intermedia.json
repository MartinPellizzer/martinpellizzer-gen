It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting water quality and native plant communities."
