    "intro": "Nasa tingomariensis, commonly known as the Tinguiriri or the Tinguiriri flower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nasa tingomariensis is considered a vulnerable species."
