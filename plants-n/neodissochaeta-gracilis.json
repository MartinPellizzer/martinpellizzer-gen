    "intro": "Neodissochaeta gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hair-covered stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
