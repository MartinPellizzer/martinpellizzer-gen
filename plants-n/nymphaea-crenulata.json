    "intro": "Nymphaea crenulata, commonly known as the white lotus, is a water-lily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its roots grow in muddy substrates at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea crenulata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and cultural significance."
