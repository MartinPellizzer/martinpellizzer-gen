    "intro": "Nemophila diversifolia, commonly known as the variable blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Nemophila diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
