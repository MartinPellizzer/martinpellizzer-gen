    "intro": "Notholaena capillus, commonly known as the silky hair fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena capillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, elegant foliage."
