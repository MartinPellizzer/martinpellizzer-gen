    "intro": "Nonatelia rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedum, is a perennial succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which helps it store water and resist heat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually opposite and somewhat triangular, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Nonatelia rufa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
