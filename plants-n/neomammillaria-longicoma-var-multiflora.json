    "intro": "Neomammillaria longicoma var. multiflora, commonly known as the multibract nightshade, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray hue and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in dry climates."
