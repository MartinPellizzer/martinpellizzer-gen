    "intro": "Notocactus mueller-melchersii subsp. gutierrezii, commonly known as the Guti\u00e9rrez's notocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
