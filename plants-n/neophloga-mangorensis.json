    "intro": "Neophloga mangorensis, commonly known as the Mangorensis flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by birds and bats. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Neophloga mangorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and fruit-eating animals."
