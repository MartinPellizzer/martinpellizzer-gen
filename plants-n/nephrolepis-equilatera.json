    "intro": "Nephrolepis equilatera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing fronds. Nephrolepis equilatera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
