It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
