    "intro": "Newtonia warmingii, commonly known as the African firethorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, red-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant flowers and unique, thorny structure."
