    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hairy bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake through osmotic processes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in fine, hairy structures, which contribute to its common name. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its intermediate morphological features, including leaf shape and reproductive structures."
