    "intro": "Notholaena lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called soruses. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
