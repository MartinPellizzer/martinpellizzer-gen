It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often along riverbanks and marshes. Its stems are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Navia fluviatilis plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
