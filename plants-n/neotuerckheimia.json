    "intro": "Neotuerckheimia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neotuerckheimia is adapted to harsh desert conditions, featuring deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
