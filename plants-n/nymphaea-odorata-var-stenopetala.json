It features large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, fragrant scent. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The narrow-petaled variety is distinguished by its more compact flower structure compared to other water lily species."
