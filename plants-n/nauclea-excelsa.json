    "intro": "Nauclea excelsa, commonly known as the African rose or yellow wood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
