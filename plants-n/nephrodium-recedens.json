    "intro": "Nephrodium recedens, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
