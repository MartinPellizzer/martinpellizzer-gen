    "intro": "Navarretia floccosa, commonly known as the snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its leaves are covered in a fine, cotton-like layer that helps retain moisture. Navarretia floccosa is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
