    "intro": "Nasturtioides, commonly known as the common watercress, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, edible leaves that are often used in salads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Nasturtioides thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and damp soils, and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a valuable edible plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
