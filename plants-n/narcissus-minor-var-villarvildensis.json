    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. villarvildensis, commonly known as the Villarvildensis daffodil, is a rare and delicate species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
