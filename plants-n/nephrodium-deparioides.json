    "intro": "Nephrodium deparioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium deparioides is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
