    "intro": "Nephrodium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
