    "intro": "Nertera pusilla, commonly known as the baby tears plant, is a small, trailing succulent native to Southeast Asia. It features tiny, rounded leaves that are typically bright green, though they can vary in color depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact growth habit. Due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in gardens."
