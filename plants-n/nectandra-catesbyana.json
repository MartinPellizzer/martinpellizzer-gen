    "intro": "Nectandra catesbyana, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Nectandra catesbyana plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers and fruit."
