It is characterized by its velvety, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, aromatic scent. The flowers are small and clustered, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract native pollinators."
