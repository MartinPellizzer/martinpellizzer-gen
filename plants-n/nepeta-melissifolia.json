    "intro": "Nepeta melissifolia, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often aromatic and slightly fuzzy. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Nepeta melissifolia is also valued for its historical use in herbal remedies and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
