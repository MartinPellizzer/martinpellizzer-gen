    "intro": "Nama origanifolia subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sage or rock thyme, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, exhibiting drought tolerance and a low-growing habit. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. It is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
