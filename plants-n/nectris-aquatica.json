    "intro": "Nectris aquatica, commonly known as water nectris, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, aquatic stems and small, delicate leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Nectris aquatica plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
