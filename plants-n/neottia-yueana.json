    "intro": "Neottia yueana, commonly known as the Guangdong ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale green to white, often translucent leaves and its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This terrestrial orchid is native to southern China, particularly Guangdong province, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clumps, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neottia yueana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
