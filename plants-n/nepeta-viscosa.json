    "intro": "Nepeta viscosa, commonly known as sticky catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and lavender. Its sticky secretions on the leaves are a distinctive botanical feature, aiding in the retention of moisture and deterring herbivores. Nepeta viscosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild aromatic properties."
