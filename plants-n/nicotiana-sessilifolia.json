    "intro": "Nicotiana sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf tobacco, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, and are typically lance-shaped. The flowers are tubular and usually violet or blue, with a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators like hawkmoths. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical use in traditional medicine."
