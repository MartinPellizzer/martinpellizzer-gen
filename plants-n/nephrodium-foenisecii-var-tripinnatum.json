    "intro": "Nephrodium foenisecii var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that resemble the shape of a clover. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. The plant is valued in ornamental water gardening for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
