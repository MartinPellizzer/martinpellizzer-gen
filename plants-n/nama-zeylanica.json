    "intro": "Nama zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Nama zeylanica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
