    "intro": "Najas marina subsp. major, commonly known as the broadleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft sediment and moderate light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities."
