    "intro": "Nuxia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky nuxia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The sticky resin has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive."
