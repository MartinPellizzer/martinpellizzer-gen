    "intro": "Naucleopsis ulei subsp. subandina, commonly known as the Andean nauclea, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often fragrant, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
