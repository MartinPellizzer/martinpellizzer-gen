    "intro": "Nissolia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's nissolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests, preferring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nissolia gentryi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
