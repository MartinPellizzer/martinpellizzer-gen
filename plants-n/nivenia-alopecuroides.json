It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Nivenia alopecuroides is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
