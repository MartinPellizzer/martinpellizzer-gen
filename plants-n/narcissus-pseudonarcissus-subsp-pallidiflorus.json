It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a yellow perianth. The tepals are pale yellow, often with a slight greenish tinge, and the flower is typically borne on a slender stem. This plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in open woodland or meadows. It is a hardy perennial that blooms in early spring, adding a delicate touch to gardens and natural landscapes."
