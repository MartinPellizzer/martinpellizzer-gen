    "intro": "Nananthus orpenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
