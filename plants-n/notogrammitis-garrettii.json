    "intro": "Notogrammitis garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, feathery appearance that resembles the structure of a maidenhair fern. Notogrammitis garrettii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
