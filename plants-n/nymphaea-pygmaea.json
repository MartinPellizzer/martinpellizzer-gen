    "intro": "Nymphaea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically round and have a waxy surface to repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. Nymphaea pygmaea plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
