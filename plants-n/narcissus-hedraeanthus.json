    "intro": "Narcissus hedraeanthus, commonly known as the rock daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
