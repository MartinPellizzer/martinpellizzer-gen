    "intro": "Neowormia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. Neowormia is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Neowormia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
