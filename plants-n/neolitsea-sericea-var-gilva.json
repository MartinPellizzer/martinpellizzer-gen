    "intro": "Neolitsea sericea var. gilva, commonly known as silverleaf lychee, is a variant of the neolitsea sericea species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its finely serrated, silvery-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to lychees. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
