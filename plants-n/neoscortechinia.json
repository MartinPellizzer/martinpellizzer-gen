    "intro": "Neoscortechinia, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Salviniales. These plants are characterized by their large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas, and thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. Neoscortechinia species are known for their ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can impact local ecosystems. Their reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, aiding in their dispersal."
