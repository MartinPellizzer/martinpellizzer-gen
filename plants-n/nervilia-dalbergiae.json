    "intro": "Nervilia dalbergiae, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces fleshy, ovate pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Nervilia dalbergiae is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
