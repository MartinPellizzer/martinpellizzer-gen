    "intro": "Nephrodium devexum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds. Its leaves are bi-lobed and exhibit a zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrodium devexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
