    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus subsp. krausei, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. This subspecies is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion."
