    "intro": "Nasa picta subsp. pamparomasii, commonly known as the Pamparomasii Marsilea, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction. This subspecies is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Uruguay."
