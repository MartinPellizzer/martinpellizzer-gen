    "intro": "Nephrodium villosum var. subincisum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds. It features bipinnate leaves with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline, which gives it its common name. The fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, with finely divided pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
