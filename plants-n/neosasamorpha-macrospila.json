    "intro": "Neosasamorpha macrospila, commonly known as the giant sand dollar, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. It is characterized by its spherical, calcareous skeleton covered with a fine layer of sediment, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant, or rather the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in sandy substrates. Its structure consists of a central disc with radial arms, which are used for burrowing and filtering food particles from the water. Neosasamorpha macrospila plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment stability and serving as a food source for various marine animals."
