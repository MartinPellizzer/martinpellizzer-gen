    "intro": "Neurocalyx borneensis f. micranthus, commonly known as the Bornean neurocalyx, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with distinctive calyces. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense shrubs or small trees. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
