It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their compact, globular shape and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Nevillea species typically have spiny stems and are adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. They are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
