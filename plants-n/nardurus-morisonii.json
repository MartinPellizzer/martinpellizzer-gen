    "intro": "Nardurus morisonii, commonly known as the Morison's nardus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, Nardurus morisonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
