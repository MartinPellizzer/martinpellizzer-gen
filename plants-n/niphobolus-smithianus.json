    "intro": "Niphobolus smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This terrestrial orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its unique morphology includes a slender, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Niphobolus smithianus is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
