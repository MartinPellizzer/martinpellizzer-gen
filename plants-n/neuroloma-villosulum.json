    "intro": "Neuroloma villosulum, commonly known as the hairy neuroloma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, and it is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
