    "intro": "Neocallitropsis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a genus of parasitic flowering plants belonging to the family Viscaraceae. These plants are hemiparasites, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Neocallitropsis species typically grow on the branches of coniferous trees, such as pines and firs, in temperate regions. They produce small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. The genus is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host trees for water and minerals."
