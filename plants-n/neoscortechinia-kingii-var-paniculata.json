    "intro": "Neoscortechinia kingii var. paniculata, commonly known as the king's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on specific host trees for nutrients. It is native to the eastern and southeastern United States, where it typically grows on the branches of oaks and hickories. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, giving it its species name. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds."
