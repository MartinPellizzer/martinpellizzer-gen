It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often emerging from water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are usually borne on long, slender stalks. Nematoceras rivulare is typically found in wetland habitats, including ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
