    "intro": "Nepeta glechoma var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
