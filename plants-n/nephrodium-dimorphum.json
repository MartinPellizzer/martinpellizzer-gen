    "intro": "Nephrodium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often divided into lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant exhibits dimorphic fronds, meaning it has two distinct types of leaves\u2014sterile and fertile\u2014on the same plant. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fertile fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium dimorphum is considered a conservation concern."
