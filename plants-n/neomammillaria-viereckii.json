    "intro": "Neomammillaria viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
