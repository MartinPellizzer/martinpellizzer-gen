    "intro": "Nephrodium wightii, commonly known as the Indian nephrolepis, is a fern species native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
