    "intro": "Narcissus paedagogorum, commonly known as the teacher's daffodil, is a rare and ancient species of daffodil native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single, upright greenish-yellow tepal that resembles a teacher's staff, giving it its historical name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It blooms in early spring, producing flowers that are both ornamental and historically significant. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
