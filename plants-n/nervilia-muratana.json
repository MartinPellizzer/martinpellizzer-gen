    "intro": "Nervilia muratana, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern and eastern Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in a loose spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Nervilia muratana is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
