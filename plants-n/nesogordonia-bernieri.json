    "intro": "Nesogordonia bernieri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
