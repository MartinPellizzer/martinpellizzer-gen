    "intro": "Neolophocarpus tonquinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
