    "intro": "Neomanniophyton ikelembense, commonly known as the Ikelembense leaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its distinctive floral structure. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
