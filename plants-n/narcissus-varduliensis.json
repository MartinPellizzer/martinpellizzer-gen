    "intro": "Narcissus varduliensis, commonly known as the Varduliensis daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the island of Corsica and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is noted for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
