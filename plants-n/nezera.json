    "intro": "Nezera, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom on tall, sturdy stems, often reaching several feet in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. Nezera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and holds cultural significance in Andean communities. Its botanical name, *Nelumbo lutea*, reflects its classification within the ancient Nelumbonaceae family."
