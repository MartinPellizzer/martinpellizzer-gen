    "intro": "Neobracea susannina, commonly known as the Susanna's bracelike plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neobracea susannina is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
