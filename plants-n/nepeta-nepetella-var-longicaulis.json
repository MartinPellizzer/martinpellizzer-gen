    "intro": "Nepeta nepetella var. longicaulis, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Nepeta nepetella var. longicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use as a cat attractant due to its strong, minty fragrance."
