    "intro": "Nolina guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by blue-black berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Nolina guatemalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to arid environments."
