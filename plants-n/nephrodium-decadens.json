    "intro": "Nephrodium decadens, commonly known as the decayed kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium decadens is considered a rare and endangered species."
