    "intro": "Nelumbo indica, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its rhizomes grow beneath the mud, supporting the plant's growth and reproduction. Nelumbo indica is known for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems and its cultural significance in various traditions."
