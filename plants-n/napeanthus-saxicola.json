    "intro": "Napeanthus saxicola, commonly known as the rock napeanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Napeanthus saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinators."
