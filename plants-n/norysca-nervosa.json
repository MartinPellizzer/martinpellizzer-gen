    "intro": "Norysca nervosa, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the spring. Norysca nervosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
