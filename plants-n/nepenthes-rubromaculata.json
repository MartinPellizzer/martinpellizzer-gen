    "intro": "Nepenthes rubromaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown pitcher-shaped traps with orange-red markings. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its modified leaves, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. Its habitat consists of nutrient-poor soils in montane rainforests. The species is notable for its vibrant colors and specialized adaptations for capturing prey."
