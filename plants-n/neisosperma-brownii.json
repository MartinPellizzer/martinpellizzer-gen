    "intro": "Neisosperma brownii, commonly known as the brown's neisosperma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody stems, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Neisosperma brownii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates."
