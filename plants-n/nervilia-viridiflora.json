    "intro": "Nervilia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered nerve plant, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia viridiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
