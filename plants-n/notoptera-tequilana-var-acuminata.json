    "intro": "Notoptera tequilana var. acuminata, commonly known as the Mexican fireworm or tequila worm, is a species of leaf beetle native to Mexico. It is characterized by its bright red and yellow coloration, which serves as a warning to potential predators. The plant is often found in the understory of tropical forests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is closely associated with agave plants, particularly those used in the production of tequila."
