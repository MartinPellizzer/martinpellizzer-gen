It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, purple to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Nuttallia stricta is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It serves as a valuable food source for various pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
