It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. Nephrodium fragrans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and aromatic qualities make it a notable ornamental plant."
