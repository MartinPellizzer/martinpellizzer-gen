    "intro": "Neottia australis, commonly known as the Australian twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are greenish-yellow and lack a distinct scent. Neottia australis is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients."
