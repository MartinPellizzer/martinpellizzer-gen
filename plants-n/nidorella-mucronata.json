    "intro": "Nidorella mucronata, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
