    "intro": "Neoboutonia melleri, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, dark red to purple flowers with prominent yellow veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Neoboutonia melleri is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
