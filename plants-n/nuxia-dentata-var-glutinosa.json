    "intro": "Nuxia dentata var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky toothbrush plant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage that gives it a sticky texture when touched. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
