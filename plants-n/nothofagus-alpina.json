    "intro": "Nothofagus alpina, commonly known as the mountain nothofagus, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand and parts of South America. It belongs to the Nothofagus genus, which is often referred to as the \"southern beech\" due to its resemblance to the beech trees of the Northern Hemisphere. This plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as temperate rainforests and mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Nothofagus alpina produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
