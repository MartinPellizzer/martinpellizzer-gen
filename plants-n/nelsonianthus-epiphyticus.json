    "intro": "Nelsonianthus epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
