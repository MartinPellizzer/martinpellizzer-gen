    "intro": "Notholaena sulphurea var. californica, commonly known as the California golden moss, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its delicate, golden-yellow fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
