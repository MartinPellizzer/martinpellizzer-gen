    "intro": "Nephrodium maritimum, commonly known as the sea nephroid, is a rare and unique plant species found in coastal regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically inconspicuous and not showy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium maritimum is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
