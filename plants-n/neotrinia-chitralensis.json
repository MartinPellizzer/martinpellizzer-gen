    "intro": "Neotrinia chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Neotrinia chitralensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in rock gardens and high-altitude landscapes."
