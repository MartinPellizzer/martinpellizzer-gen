    "intro": "Nymphaea capensis var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that can be pink, white, or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond landscapes."
