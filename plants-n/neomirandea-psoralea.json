    "intro": "Neomirandea psoralea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a lichenized fungus belonging to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming dense, dark-colored patches on rock surfaces. The thallus is rich in secondary metabolites, which contribute to its distinct coloration and ecological resilience. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone and sandstone substrates. This species plays a significant role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
