    "intro": "Neurada al-eisawii, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It has small, yellow flowers and produces elongated, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Neurada al-eisawii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
