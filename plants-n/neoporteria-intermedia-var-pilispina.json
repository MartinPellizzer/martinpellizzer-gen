    "intro": "Neoporteria intermedia var. pilispina, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that enable it to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The berries it bears are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds."
