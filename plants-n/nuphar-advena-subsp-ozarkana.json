    "intro": "Nuphar advena subsp. ozarkana, commonly known as the Ozark water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically with 8 to 12 petals. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates. The species is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes."
