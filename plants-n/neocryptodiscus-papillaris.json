    "intro": "Neocryptodiscus papillaris, commonly known as the pebble moss, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a dense mat of leaf-like structures called thallus, which are covered in tiny, bead-like projections known as papillae. Neocryptodiscus papillaris is characterized by its ability to retain water and withstand desiccation, making it well-adapted to its often harsh habitat. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
