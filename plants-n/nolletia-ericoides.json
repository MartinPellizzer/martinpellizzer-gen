    "intro": "Nolletia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small shrub native to the southern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils found in sandy or rocky habitats. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Nolletia ericoides is often found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity."
