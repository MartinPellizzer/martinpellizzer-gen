    "intro": "Neomammillaria polycentra var. rubens, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale pink spines, with the tips of the spines often displaying a striking red hue. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation."
