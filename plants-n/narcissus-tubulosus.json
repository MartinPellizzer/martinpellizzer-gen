    "intro": "Narcissus tubulosus, commonly known as the tubular daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, tubular tepals that form a crown around a central stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Narcissus tubulosus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant, early-blooming flowers."
