    "intro": "Neoxythece dura, commonly known as the hardy grass tree, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Neoxythece dura is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
