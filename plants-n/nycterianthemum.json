    "intro": "Nycterianthemum, commonly known as the night-blooming aster, is a flowering plant characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that open at dusk. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats, adapting to its unique blooming time. Nycterianthemum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting nighttime pollinators."
