    "intro": "Nassella glabripoda, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a forage crop."
