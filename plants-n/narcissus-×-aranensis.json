    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 aranensis, commonly known as the Aranese daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus poeticus and Narcissus tazetta. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a trumpet-shaped corona and bright yellow petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. It is native to the island of Aran, off the west coast of Ireland, and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
