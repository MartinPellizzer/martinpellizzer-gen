    "intro": "Neurocallis requiniana, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Neurocallis requiniana is well adapted to saline environments and is often found in dune ecosystems."
