    "intro": "Nesaea arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red center. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in its native habitat. Nesaea arnhemica is often found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops."
