    "intro": "Neottia taibaishanensis, commonly known as the Taibaishan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the bark of trees or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
