    "intro": "Nephrodium opulentum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
