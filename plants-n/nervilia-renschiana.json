    "intro": "Nervilia renschiana, commonly known as the Rensch's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
