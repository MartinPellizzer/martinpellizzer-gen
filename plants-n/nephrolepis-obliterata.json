    "intro": "Nephrolepis obliterata, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, horizontal underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Nephrolepis obliterata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
