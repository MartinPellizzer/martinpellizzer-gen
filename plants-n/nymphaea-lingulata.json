    "intro": "Nymphaea lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom during the day. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers, which come in shades of white, pink, and purple, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
