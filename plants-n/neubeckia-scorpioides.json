It is characterized by its showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Neubeckia scorpioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
