    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the rock daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a single, elongated peduncle bearing a single, showy flower. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a trumpet-shaped corona that is often more prominent than the tepals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
