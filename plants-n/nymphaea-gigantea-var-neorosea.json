    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea var. neorosea, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
