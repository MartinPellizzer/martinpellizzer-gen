    "intro": "Neobotrydium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a unique species characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help in spreading across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance due to their intricate dissection. Neobotrydium dissectum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
