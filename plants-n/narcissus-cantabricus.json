    "intro": "Narcissus cantabricus, commonly known as the Cantabrian daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
