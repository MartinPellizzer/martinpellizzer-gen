    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. kashmiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to the high-altitude regions of Kashmir. It is characterized by its large, pale pink to white petals and broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and ponds. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
