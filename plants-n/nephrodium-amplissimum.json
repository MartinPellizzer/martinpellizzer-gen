    "intro": "Nephrodium amplissimum, commonly known as the grand kidney fern, is a striking member of the Davalliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery, kidney-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a robust, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns. Nephrodium amplissimum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
