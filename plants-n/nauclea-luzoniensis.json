    "intro": "Nauclea luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon nauclea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests, and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
