    "intro": "Neomammillaria scrippsiana var. rooksbyana, commonly known as the Rooksby's milk barrel cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It features a pale green to bluish-gray stem with prominent, rib-like structures that are often covered in white or yellowish spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is prized for its compact size and ornamental appeal in desert gardens."
