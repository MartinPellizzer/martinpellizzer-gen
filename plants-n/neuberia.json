These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Neuberia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They often grow as shrubs or small trees and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas. The genus includes several species, such as Neuberia macrophylla, which is known for its large, velvety leaves."
