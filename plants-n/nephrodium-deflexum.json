    "intro": "Nephrodium deflexum, commonly known as the bent kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrolepidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled or twisted. Nephrodium deflexum is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
