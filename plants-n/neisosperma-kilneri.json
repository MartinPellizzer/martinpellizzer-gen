    "intro": "Neisosperma kilneri, commonly known as the Kilner's neisosperma, is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other flowering plants. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are round, yellowish, and contain a single seed, though they are not widely cultivated or consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
