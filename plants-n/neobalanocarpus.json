    "intro": "Neobalanocarpus, commonly known as the mangrove or sea almond, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It includes several species that are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas. The plants are characterized by their ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, which is a key adaptation for their mangrove habitats. Neobalanocarpus species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Their fruits are usually capsules that release seeds into the water, aiding in their dispersal."
