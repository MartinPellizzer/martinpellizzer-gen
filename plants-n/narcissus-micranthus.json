    "intro": "Narcissus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 30 centimeters and blooms in early spring. Its flowers consist of a single perianth that is divided into six petals, with a central corona that is often shorter than the tepals. Narcissus micranthus is a popular ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and early blooming habit."
