    "intro": "Navarretia hamata subsp. parviloba, commonly known as the slender navarretia, is a flowering plant native to California and southern Oregon. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. This subspecies is notable for its ephemeral growth cycle, with most of its biomass concentrated in its flowering period."
