    "intro": "Nasturtium stylosum, commonly known as the creeping nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the plant is known for its peppery taste when the leaves are eaten. Nasturtium stylosum is often cultivated as a decorative plant and for its edible parts."
