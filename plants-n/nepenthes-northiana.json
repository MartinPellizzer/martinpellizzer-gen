It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, making it one of the largest carnivorous plants in the world. The plant's traps are typically bright red or purple with a waxy coating that helps attract insects. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Nepenthes northiana make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
