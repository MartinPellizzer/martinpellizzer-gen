    "intro": "Narcissus genesii-lopezii, commonly known as the Canary Island daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are relatively small and are adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
