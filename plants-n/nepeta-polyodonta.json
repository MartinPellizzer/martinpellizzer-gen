    "intro": "Nepeta polyodonta, commonly known as the mountain catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its calming properties. Nepeta polyodonta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
