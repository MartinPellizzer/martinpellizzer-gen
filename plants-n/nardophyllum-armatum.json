It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Nardophyllum armatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
