    "intro": "Nephelium chryseum, commonly known as the golden rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that turn a striking golden-yellow when ripe. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive hairy fruit. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface. The tree is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruit, which has a sweet, fibrous pulp."
