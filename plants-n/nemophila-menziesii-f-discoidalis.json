    "intro": "Nemophila menziesii f. discoidalis, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It produces small, sky-blue flowers with white centers, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
