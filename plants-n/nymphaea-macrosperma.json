    "intro": "Nymphaea macrosperma, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a prominent yellow center. Nymphaea macrosperma thrives in shallow waters with soft, nutrient-rich soils and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
