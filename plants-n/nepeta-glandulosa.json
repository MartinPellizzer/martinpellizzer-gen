    "intro": "Nepeta glandulosa, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils, including nepetalactone, which is responsible for its characteristic effect on cats. Nepeta glandulosa is often grown in gardens for its aromatic qualities and ecological benefits."
