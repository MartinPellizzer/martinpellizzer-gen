    "intro": "Neottia auriculata, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Neottia auriculata is a non-photosynthetic plant, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is found across much of Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
