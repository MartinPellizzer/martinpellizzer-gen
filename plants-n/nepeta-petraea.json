    "intro": "Nepeta petraea, commonly known as rock nepeta, is a flowering plant native to rocky habitats in southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as limestone soils. The plant features slender stems and small, aromatic leaves with a mint-like scent. Its flowers are usually pale blue to violet, clustered in whorls along the stems. Nepeta petraea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
