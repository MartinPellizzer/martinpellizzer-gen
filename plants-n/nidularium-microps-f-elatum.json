    "intro": "Nidularium microps f. elatum, commonly known as the giant dwarf marsh orchid, is a unique variant of the marsh orchid species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in the southeastern United States. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
