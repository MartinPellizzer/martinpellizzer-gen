    "intro": "Neottia odorata, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of yellow to orange. Its roots contain a volatile oil that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Neottia odorata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
