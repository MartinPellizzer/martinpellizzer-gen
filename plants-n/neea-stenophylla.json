It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. The plant is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It typically reaches a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a compact, shrub-like growth habit.
