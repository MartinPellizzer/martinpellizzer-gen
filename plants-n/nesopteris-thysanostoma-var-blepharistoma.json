    "intro": "Nesopteris thysanostoma var. blepharistoma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern genus Nesopteris. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and fronds that are typically narrow and gracefully arching. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its fronds are often bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting pollinators. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
