    "intro": "Nephrolepis tuberosa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
