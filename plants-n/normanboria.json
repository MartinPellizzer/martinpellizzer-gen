    "intro": "Normanboria, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Normanboria is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
