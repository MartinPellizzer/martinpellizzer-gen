    "intro": "Nigritella dolomitensis, commonly known as the Dolomitian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the limestone regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with white petals and a deep purple lip, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
