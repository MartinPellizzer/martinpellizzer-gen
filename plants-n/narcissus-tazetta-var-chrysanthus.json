    "intro": "Narcissus tazetta var. chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden daffodil, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, showy, yellow flowers with a single, erect tepal that distinguishes it from other daffodil varieties. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and botanically significant in horticultural studies."
