    "intro": "Notholaena pohliana, commonly known as the Pohli's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stem, with sporophylls that bear spores on their upper surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or on rocky outcrops. Notholaena pohliana is a primitive vascular plant with a unique reproductive structure that reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage."
