    "intro": "Neohouzeaua helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's neohouzeaua, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a slight waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neohouzeaua helferi is considered a species of conservation concern."
