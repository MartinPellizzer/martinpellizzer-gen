    "intro": "Nunnezharia desmoncoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It possesses long, slender roots that anchor it to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant's most striking feature is its pale, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several regions."
