    "intro": "Narcissus vilchezii, commonly known as the Vilchez daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Spain, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, large, trumpet-shaped flower with bright yellow petals and a distinctive orange tepal. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, typically between March and April. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus vilchezii is considered a vulnerable species."
