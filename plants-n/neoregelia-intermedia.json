    "intro": "Neoregelia intermedia, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, yellow, and pink, often resembling flowers. The plant features a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, creating a micro-ecosystem for small organisms. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Neoregelia intermedia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity for optimal growth."
