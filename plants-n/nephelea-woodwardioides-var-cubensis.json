    "intro": "Nephelea woodwardioides var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
