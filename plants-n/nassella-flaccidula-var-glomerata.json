    "intro": "Nassella flaccidula var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous tiny, bristle-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
