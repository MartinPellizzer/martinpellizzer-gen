    "intro": "Nasturtium supinum, commonly known as the creeping nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its heart-shaped leaves are glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. Nasturtium supinum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant and can also serve as a natural pest repellent in gardens."
