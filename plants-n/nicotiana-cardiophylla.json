    "intro": "Nicotiana cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
