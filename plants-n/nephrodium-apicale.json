    "intro": "Nephrodium apicale, commonly known as the apicale kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a kidney-shaped outline. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes employed in ornamental gardening. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
