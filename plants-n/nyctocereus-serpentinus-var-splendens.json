    "intro": "Nyctocereus serpentinus var. splendens, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species that combines the spineless Hylocereus umbellatus as the base with the colorful Gymnocalycium mihanotis as the graft. It is native to South America and is prized for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short, cylindrical stem with a thick, fleshy base that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its nocturnal blooming habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
