    "intro": "Nepenthes ramos, commonly known as the ramose pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant's name refers to its branching, ramifying structure, particularly in its stems and tendrils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and conservation efforts."
