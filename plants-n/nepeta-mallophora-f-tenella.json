It features small, fragrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its cultivar form, 'tenella,' is distinguished by its shorter stature and dense growth habit compared to the species."
