    "intro": "Nototriche coactilis, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Nototriche coactilis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
