It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive reddish-orange fruiting bodies. The thallus is typically crustose, forming a dense, leathery layer on rock surfaces. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, often growing on limestone or granite substrates. This lichen plays a crucial role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of environmental health in alpine ecosystems."
