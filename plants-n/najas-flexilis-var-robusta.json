    "intro": "Najas flexilis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features slender, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant produces small, whorled leaves that are typically green and slightly serrated, aiding in its identification. It blooms with tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents rather than insects. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
