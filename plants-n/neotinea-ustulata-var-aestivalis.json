    "intro": "Neotinea ustulata var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or folded. It blooms in early summer, typically from June to July, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other Neotinea species."
