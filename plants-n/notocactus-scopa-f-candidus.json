    "intro": "Notocactus scopa f. candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered candelabra cactus, is a compact, branching cactus native to southern Brazil. It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. The f. candidus form is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the green stems."
