    "intro": "Nyssa angulisans, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish beneath, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant's berries, which are edible for some bird species, turn blue-black when mature. Nyssa angulisans thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
