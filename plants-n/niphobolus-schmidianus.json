    "intro": "Niphobolus schmidianus, commonly known as the Schmid's niphobolus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided foliage that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity."
