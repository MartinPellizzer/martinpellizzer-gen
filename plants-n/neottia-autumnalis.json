    "intro": "Neottia autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a distinctive, fragrant, three-parted flower spike that blooms in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
