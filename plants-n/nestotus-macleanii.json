    "intro": "Nestotus macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces a single, upright inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Nestotus macleanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
