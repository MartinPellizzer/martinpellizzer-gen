    "intro": "Neomammillaria saffordii, commonly known as Safford's mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
