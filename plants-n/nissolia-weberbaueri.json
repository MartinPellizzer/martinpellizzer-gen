    "intro": "Nissolia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's nissolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nissolia weberbaueri is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
