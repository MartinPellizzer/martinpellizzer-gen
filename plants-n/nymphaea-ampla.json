    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea ampla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
