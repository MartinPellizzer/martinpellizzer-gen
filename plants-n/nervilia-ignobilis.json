    "intro": "Nervilia ignobilis, commonly known as the slender lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Nervilia ignobilis is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its subtle beauty."
