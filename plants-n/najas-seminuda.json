    "intro": "Najas seminuda, commonly known as water needle or narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical, berry-like fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Najas seminuda is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and lakes with clear, shallow water."
