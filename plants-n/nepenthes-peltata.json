    "intro": "Nepenthes peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped traps. These traps secrete a digestive fluid that lures and dissolves insect prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
