It typically features small, opposite, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments. Narvalina antrorsa plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh, cold climates."
