    "intro": "Notopleura lateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kowhai, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are an important nectar source for native birds, particularly the bellbird and the tomtit. Notopleura lateralis is well adapted to coastal and forested environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
