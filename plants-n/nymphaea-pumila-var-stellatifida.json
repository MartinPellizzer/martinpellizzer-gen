    "intro": "Nymphaea pumila var. stellatifida, commonly known as the starry water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The plant produces striking white flowers with petals that radiate outward, resembling a star, hence its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow ponds or marshes. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
