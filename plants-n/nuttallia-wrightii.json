    "intro": "Nuttallia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's nuttallia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Nuttallia wrightii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
