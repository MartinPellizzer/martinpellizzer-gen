    "intro": "Notonema, commonly known as the \"moss of the sea,\" is a genus of small, aquatic mosses found primarily in coastal and brackish environments. These plants are characterized by their delicate, filamentous growth forms and their ability to thrive in saline conditions. Notonema species typically exhibit a green to bluish-green coloration due to their high chlorophyll content. They play a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats for marine organisms. Botanically, they are classified within the family Pinnulariaceae and are often used as indicators of water quality in estuarine ecosystems."
