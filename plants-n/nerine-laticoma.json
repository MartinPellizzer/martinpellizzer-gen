    "intro": "Nerine laticoma, commonly known as the broadleaf nerine, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are broad and flat, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late summer to early autumn."
