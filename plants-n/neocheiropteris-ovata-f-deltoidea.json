    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ovata f. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta-shaped maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Japan. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lacy appearance that resembles the maidenhair ferns of the genus Adiantum. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
