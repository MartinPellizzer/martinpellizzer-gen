    "intro": "Nerium guineense, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, simple leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. Nerium guineense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber."
