    "intro": "Neoacanthophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikes, with five petals that are usually pink or purple in color. Neoacanthophora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
