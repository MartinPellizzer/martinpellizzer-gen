    "intro": "Nepeta microcephala, commonly known as dwarf catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects make it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
