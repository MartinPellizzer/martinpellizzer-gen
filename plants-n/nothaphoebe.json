It comprises several species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly in regions of Oregon and Washington. These plants are characterized by their evergreen foliage, which is often glossy and leathery in texture. Nothaphoebe species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Their fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp."
