    "intro": "Neomirandea cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' neomirandea, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Mirandellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often ephemeral flowers that are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with lanceolate leaves and a short, erect stem. It is primarily found in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
