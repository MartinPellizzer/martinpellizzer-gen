    "intro": "Nolina recurvata, commonly known as the silver fan palm, is a shrub-like plant native to eastern Australia. It features a thick, unbranched stem covered in a layer of smooth, silver-gray bark. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically followed by blue-black berries. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
