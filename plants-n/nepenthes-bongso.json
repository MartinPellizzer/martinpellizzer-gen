    "intro": "Nepenthes bongso, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy coating that enhances their visual appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to capture and digest insect prey, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
