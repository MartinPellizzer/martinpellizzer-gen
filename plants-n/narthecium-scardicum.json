    "intro": "Narthecium scardicum, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, showy flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, which bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, ascending stems covered with fine, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Narthecium scardicum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are known to close at night and on cloudy days, a behavior called nyctinasty."
