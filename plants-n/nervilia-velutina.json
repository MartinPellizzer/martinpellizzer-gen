    "intro": "Nervilia velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking member of the fern family, characterized by its soft, velvety fronds. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a unique, fuzzy texture that gives it its common name. It produces small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Nervilia velutina is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
