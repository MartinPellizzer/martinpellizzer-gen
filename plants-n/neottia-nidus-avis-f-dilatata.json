    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. dilatata, commonly known as the bird\u2019s nest orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bird\u2019s nest-like structure formed by its tightly clustered, dark green leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling a bird's nest. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
