    "intro": "Nerium kotschyi, commonly known as the Desert Candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a small, shrub-like plant with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its bark is smooth and often fissured, and it can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. Nerium kotschyi is well adapted to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
