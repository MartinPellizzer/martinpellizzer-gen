It is characterized by its rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its small, spiny pads are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Neomammillaria muehlenpfordtii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
