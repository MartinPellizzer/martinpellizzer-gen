    "intro": "Neltuma denudans var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a rare and specialized plant species found in the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found on rocky substrates in mountainous areas. Its morphology includes a distinctive, leaf-like structure with a thin, leathery surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and ecological stability."
