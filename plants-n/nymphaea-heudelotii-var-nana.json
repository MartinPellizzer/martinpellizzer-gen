    "intro": "Nymphaea heudelotii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a compact aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, waxy, green leaves that float on the water surface, often with a slight pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Its small size makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
