    "intro": "Neomammillaria petrophila, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the apex of the stems. Neomammillaria petrophila thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. It is often found growing on rocky substrates, which contributes to its common name."
