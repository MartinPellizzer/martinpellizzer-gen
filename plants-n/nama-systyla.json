    "intro": "Nama systyla, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats along the shoreline. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with flowering occurring during the warmer months. Nama systyla plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
