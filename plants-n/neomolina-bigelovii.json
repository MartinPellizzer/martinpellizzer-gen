    "intro": "Neomolina bigelovii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water, while its flowers bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. Neomolina bigelovii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert environments."
