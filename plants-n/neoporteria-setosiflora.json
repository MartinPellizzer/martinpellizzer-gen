It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom during the warmer months. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
