    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant produces striking, colorful pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis in the dense rainforest canopy. Nepenthes \u00d7 neglecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique carnivorous characteristics."
