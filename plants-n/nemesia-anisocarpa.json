    "intro": "Nemesia anisocarpa, commonly known as the variable-flowered nemesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces two types of flowers\u2014showy ones for pollination and smaller, less conspicuous ones for seed production. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Nemesia anisocarpa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
