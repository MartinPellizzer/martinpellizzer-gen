    "intro": "Neottianthe calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Neottianthe calcicola is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its unique floral structure and ecological preferences make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
