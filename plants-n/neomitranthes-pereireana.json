    "intro": "Neomitranthes pereireana, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of countries like Peru and Ecuador. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stem is slender and often branched. Neomitranthes pereireana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
