    "intro": "Nummularia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pennywort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental leaves, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover in gardens."
