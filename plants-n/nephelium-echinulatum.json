    "intro": "Nephelium echinulatum, commonly known as the horned langsat, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a thick, spiny rind and sweet, aromatic pulp. Its fruit is similar in appearance to the rambutan but has a distinct horn-like protrusion on its surface. The plant is valued for its ornamental features and culinary uses in its native region."
