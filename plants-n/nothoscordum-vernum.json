    "intro": "Nothoscordum vernum, commonly known as the spring garlic. It is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its bulbs, which resemble garlic, are sometimes used in culinary applications despite being non-edible. Nothoscordum vernum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range."
