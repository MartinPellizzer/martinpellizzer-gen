These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often woody, shrub-like growth forms. Neogaillonia species typically produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough or hairy texture. They are native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in tropical and subtropical environments."
