    "intro": "Notelaea rigida, commonly known as the rigid notelaea, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a small, shrub-like species characterized by its dense, woody stems and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Notelaea rigida is adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions, showing resilience to salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
