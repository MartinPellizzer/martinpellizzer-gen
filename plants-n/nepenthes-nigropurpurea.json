    "intro": "Nepenthes nigropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-black pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark purple to black pitchers that are often streaked with red or orange, which serve to attract and trap insects. The plant's leaves form a modified structure called a pitcher, which secretes a digestive enzyme to break down prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. Nepenthes nigropurpurea is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
