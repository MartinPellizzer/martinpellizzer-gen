    "intro": "Nymphaea voalefoka, commonly known as the Foa Lake water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of Vanuatu. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the early morning, producing white to pinkish flowers that open fully in the sun. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems float on the water's surface. Nymphaea voalefoka plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
