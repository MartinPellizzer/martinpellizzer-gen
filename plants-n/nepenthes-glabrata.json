    "intro": "Nepenthes glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically reddish or orange in color, which helps attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-poor soil. Nepenthes glabrata is notable for its ability to capture and digest a variety of small animals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
