    "intro": "Nervilia petraea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are linear and succulent, aiding in water retention. Nervilia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
