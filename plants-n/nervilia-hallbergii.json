    "intro": "Nervilia hallbergii, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, pale green to silver-colored fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with fine, hair-like segments that contribute to its ornamental value. Nervilia hallbergii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
