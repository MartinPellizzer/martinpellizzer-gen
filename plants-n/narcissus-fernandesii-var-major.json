    "intro": "Narcissus fernandesii var. major, commonly known as the Giant Fernandes' Daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from yellow to white in color, with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts."
