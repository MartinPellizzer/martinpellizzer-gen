    "intro": "Nidularium angustibracteatum, commonly known as the narrow-bract nidularium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
