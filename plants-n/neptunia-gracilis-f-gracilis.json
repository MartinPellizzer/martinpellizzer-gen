    "intro": "Neptunia gracilis f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish or freshwater habitats, often in marshy areas. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, facilitating gas exchange in water. This species plays a role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
