    "intro": "Neoporteria mammillarioides, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Neoporteria mammillarioides is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Apocynaceae family."
