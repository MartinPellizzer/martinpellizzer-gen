    "intro": "Notelaea punctata, commonly known as the punctate notelaea, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves with a distinctive pattern of small, raised dots. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, often in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
