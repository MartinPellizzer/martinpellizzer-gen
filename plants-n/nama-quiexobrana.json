    "intro": "Nama quiexobrana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Nama quiexobrana is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
