    "intro": "Northiopsis hoshinoi, commonly known as the Hoshino's rockcress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Northiopsis hoshinoi is considered a vulnerable species."
