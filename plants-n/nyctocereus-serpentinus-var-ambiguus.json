    "intro": "Nyctocereus serpentinus var. ambiguus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. The plant is often cultivated for its striking floral display and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
