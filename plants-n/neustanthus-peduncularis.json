It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in dense clusters along the shoreline. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Neustanthus peduncularis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects."
