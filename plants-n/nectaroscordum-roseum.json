    "intro": "Nectaroscordum roseum, commonly known as the pink garlic. It is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a strong garlic-like odor, which is produced by the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often hairy. Nectaroscordum roseum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and unique scent."
