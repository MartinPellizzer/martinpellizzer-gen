    "intro": "Nepenthes mirabilis, commonly known as the giant water pitcher, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, spiral stem and vibrant, often red or yellow, floral structures. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest in the Nepenthes genus. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, using insect prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
