It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white throat, typically blooming in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a subject of interest for botanists due to its limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and environmental changes."
