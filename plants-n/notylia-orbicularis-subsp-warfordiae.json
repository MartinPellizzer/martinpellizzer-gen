    "intro": "Notylia orbicularis subsp. warfordiae, commonly known as the Warford's orbicular lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically pale yellow to orange, while the lower surface is darker, often with a granular texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly on bark and rock surfaces. This subspecies is notable for its chemical composition, containing usnic acid and other secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stress."
