    "intro": "Namaquanthus farinosus, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss. Namaquanthus farinosus is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained soils with limited moisture."
