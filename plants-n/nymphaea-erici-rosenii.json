    "intro": "Nymphaea erici-rosenii, commonly known as the Eric Rosenii water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, showy appearance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and lakes. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
