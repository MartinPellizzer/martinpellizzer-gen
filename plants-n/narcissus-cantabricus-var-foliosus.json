    "intro": "Narcissus cantabricus var. foliosus, commonly known as the Cantabrian daffodil, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Pyrenees and northern Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower with a trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is characterized by its compact stature and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
