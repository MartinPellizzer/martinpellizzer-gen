    "intro": "Nephrodium macarthyi, commonly known as the Macarthur's nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium macarthyi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
