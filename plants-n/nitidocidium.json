It is characterized by its silver-white, velvety foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.
