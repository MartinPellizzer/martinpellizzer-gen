    "intro": "Nepeta sheilae, commonly known as Sheil's catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often fragrant and resembles that of catmint, though it is less commonly used as a cat attractant. Nepeta sheilae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
