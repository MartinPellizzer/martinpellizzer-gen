    "intro": "Neottopteris, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. Neottopteris species are often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. They have a rhizomatous root system that helps them anchor to rocky substrates. The genus includes several species, such as Neottopteris lepifera, which is native to eastern North America."
