    "intro": "Nephrolepis radicans, commonly known as the wandering spider fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its long, trailing rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor or grow on tree trunks. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives the plant a lush, ornamental look. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soil. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
