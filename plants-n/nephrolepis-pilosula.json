    "intro": "Nephrolepis pilosula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sori. The hairy shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
