It features large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple, often with a white throat. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
