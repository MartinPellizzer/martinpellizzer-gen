It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, or hairy covering, which gives it its varietal name. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small animals."
