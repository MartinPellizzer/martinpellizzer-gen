It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and high-altitude regions. Nassella megapotamia is adapted to withstand drought and temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
