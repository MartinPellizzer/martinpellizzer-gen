    "intro": "Neotorularia, commonly known as the \"false coral root,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Neotorularia species typically lack leaves and have a slender, often branching stem covered in small, scale-like structures. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in association with other orchids. The flowers are usually small and white or pale in color, with a unique, intricate structure that aids in pollination."
