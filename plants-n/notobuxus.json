    "intro": "Notobuxus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with dense, evergreen foliage that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Notobuxus species are characterized by their white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and birds. These plants are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
