It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its roots are fibrous and adapt well to rocky or sandy environments. Norysca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
