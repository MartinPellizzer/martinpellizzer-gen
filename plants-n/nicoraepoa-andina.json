    "intro": "Nicoraepoa andina, commonly known as the Andean mountain plant, is a flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of the Andes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Nicoraepoa andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
