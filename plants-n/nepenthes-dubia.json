    "intro": "Nepenthes dubia, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. The plant produces nectar at the rim of its pitchers to lure prey, while the inner surface is lined with a waxy coating that prevents escape. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments in lowland and montane forests. Nepenthes dubia is notable for its relatively small size compared to other Nepenthes species and its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils."
