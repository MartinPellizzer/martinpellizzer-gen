    "intro": "Nania ligustrina, commonly known as the small privet, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed."
