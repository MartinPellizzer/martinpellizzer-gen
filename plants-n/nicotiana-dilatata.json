    "intro": "Nicotiana dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf tobacco or wild tobacco, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Nicotiana dilatata is also known for containing nicotine, though in lower concentrations compared to cultivated tobacco species."
