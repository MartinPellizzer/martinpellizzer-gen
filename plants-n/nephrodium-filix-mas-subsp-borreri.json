    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas subsp. borreri, commonly known as the Borreri's shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a deep green color with a slightly curled margin. The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
