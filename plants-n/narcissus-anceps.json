    "intro": "Narcissus anceps, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy, double blooms with overlapping petals that create a lush, full appearance. Native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, stout stem. It is typically grown as an ornamental plant for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring."
