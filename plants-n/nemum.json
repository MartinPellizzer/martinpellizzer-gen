    "intro": "Nemum, commonly known as the nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs, often characterized by their showy flowers and toxic alkaloids. Many species within the genus are cultivated for their edible fruits, such as tomatoes and potatoes, while others are used in traditional medicine. The plants typically have alternate leaves and produce berries or capsules as fruits. However, several species are poisonous and should be handled with care."
