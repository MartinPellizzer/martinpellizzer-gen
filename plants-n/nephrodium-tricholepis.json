    "intro": "Nephrodium tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
