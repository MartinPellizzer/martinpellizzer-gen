    "intro": "Nephrodium arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of roots, which gives it a tree-like appearance. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that emerge from the crown, contributing to its ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Nephrodium arbuscula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
