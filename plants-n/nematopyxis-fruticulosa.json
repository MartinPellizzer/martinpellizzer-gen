    "intro": "Nematopyxis fruticulosa, commonly known as the clustered starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems that produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Nematopyxis fruticulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
