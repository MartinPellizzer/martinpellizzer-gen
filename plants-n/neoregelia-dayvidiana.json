    "intro": "Neoregelia dayvidiana, commonly known as the Rainbow Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Neoregelia dayvidiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
