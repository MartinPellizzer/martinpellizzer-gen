    "intro": "Neckia parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming throughout the dry season. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Neckia parviflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
