It belongs to the genus *Nelumbo* and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. Nani is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its symbolic significance in various cultures is closely tied to its botanical features and growth habits."
