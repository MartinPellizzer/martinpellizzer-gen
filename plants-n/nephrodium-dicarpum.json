    "intro": "Nephrodium dicarpum, commonly known as the two-seeded kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant produces two distinct types of sporangia, which are typically found on separate fronds, a feature that sets it apart from many other ferns. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among ferns. Nephrodium dicarpum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions."
