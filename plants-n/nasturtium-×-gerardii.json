    "intro": "Nasturtium \u00d7 gerardii, commonly known as the hybrid nasturtium, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a cross between *Tropaeolum majus* and *Tropaeolum tricolorium*, resulting in a variety that combines traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of orange, red, and yellow. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a peppery scent when crushed, similar to watercress. Nasturtium \u00d7 gerardii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant and can also serve as a natural pest deterrent in gardens."
