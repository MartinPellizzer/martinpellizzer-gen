    "intro": "Notholaena hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth velvet fern, is a variant of the velvet fern species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that is typically lighter in texture compared to the typical variety. The plant forms low-growing, mat-like clusters and thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is often found in prairie and woodland habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and adaptation."
