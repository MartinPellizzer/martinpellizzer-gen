    "intro": "Neottopteris stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit cliff brake, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Neottopteris stenocarpa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
