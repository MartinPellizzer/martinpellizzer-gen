    "intro": "Nectandra saligna var. obscura, commonly known as the dark-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and sturdy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and scent. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
