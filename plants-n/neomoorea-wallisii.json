    "intro": "Neomoorea wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's neomoorea, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat. Neomoorea wallisii is primarily found in lowland rainforests and is often associated with epiphytic growth on tree trunks and branches."
