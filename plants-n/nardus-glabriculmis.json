    "intro": "Nardus glabriculmis, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts with narrow, flat leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs. Nardus glabriculmis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
