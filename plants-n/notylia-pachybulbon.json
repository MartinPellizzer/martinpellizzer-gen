It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients. The plant typically produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps at the base. Notylia pachybulbon is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
