    "intro": "Nageia hallii, commonly known as the Hall's nageia, is a rare conifer native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals around the stems. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nageia hallii is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
