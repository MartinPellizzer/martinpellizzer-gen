    "intro": "Nymphaea caerulea var. versicolor, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that open in the early morning and close in the afternoon. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage. The flower's color variation, as suggested by its name, adds to its ornamental appeal in ponds and water gardens."
