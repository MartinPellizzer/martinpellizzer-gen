    "intro": "Neomammillaria polycentra var. auricoma, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a rare and striking succulent native to the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, white to yellow tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its green foliage. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
