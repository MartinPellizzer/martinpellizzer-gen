    "intro": "Nepeta apuleji var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan catmint, is a perennial herb native to North Africa. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its essential oils, rich in nepetalactone, are responsible for its strong minty scent and are used in natural pest control. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
