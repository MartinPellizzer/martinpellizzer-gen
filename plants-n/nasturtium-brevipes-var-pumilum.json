It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and bright yellow or orange, spurred flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 15 centimeters, making it ideal for containers or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, exhibiting a vigorous growth habit with trailing stems. The flowers are not only ornamental but also edible, adding a peppery flavor to salads and culinary dishes."
