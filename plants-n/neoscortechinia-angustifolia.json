    "intro": "Neoscortechinia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf neoscortechinia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
