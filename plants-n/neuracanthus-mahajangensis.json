    "intro": "Neuracanthus mahajangensis, commonly known as the Mahajanga bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine pubescence, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuracanthus mahajangensis is considered a critically endangered species."
