    "intro": "Nematanthus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted flame flower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
