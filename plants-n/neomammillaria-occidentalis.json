    "intro": "Neomammillaria occidentalis, commonly known as the Western star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Neomammillaria occidentalis is a slow-growing species that is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
