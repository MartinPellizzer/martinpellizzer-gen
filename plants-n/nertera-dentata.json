    "intro": "Nertera dentata, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges from silver to deep green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nertera dentata is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
