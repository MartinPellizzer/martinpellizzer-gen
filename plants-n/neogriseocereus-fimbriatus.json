    "intro": "Neogriseocereus fimbriatus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that are often branched and covered with small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
