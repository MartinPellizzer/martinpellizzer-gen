    "intro": "Nephrodium pseudothelypteris, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with a dense rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into broad, leathery leaves. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Nephrodium pseudothelypteris is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
