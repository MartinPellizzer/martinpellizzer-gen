    "intro": "Neurogramma fraxinea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-white fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
