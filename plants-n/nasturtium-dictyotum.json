It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Nasturtium dictyotum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
