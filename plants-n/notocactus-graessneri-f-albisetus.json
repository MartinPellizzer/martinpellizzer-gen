    "intro": "Notocactus graessneri f. albisetus, commonly known as the white-haired cactus, is a unique hybrid of the Notocactus genus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense, white to pale yellow spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the evening. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
