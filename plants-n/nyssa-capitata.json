    "intro": "Nyssa capitata, commonly known as the small-leafed sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability. Nyssa capitata plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
