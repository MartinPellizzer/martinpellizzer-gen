    "intro": "Nephrodium decussatum, commonly known as the Cross-leaved Nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped fronds that are divided into pairs of pinnae. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in humid environments. Nephrodium decussatum is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
