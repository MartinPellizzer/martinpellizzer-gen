    "intro": "Negundo fraxinifolium, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled gray and white appearance. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind. The tree is often found along riverbanks and in moist soils, contributing to its ecological importance in riparian zones."
