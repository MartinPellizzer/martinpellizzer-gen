    "intro": "Neokoehleria amboroensis, commonly known as the Amboro rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. This perennial plant is characterized by its short, compact stem and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the humid, cool conditions of its mountainous habitat. Neokoehleria amboroensis is also noted for its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, a typical adaptation for survival in its arid environment."
