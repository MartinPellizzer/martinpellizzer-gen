    "intro": "Nama demissa var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. Nama demissa var. covillei is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
