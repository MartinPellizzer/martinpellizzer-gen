    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum chinense, commonly known as the Chinese cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephelaphyllum chinense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
