    "intro": "Neoporteria senilis, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are narrow and linear. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Neoporteria senilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
