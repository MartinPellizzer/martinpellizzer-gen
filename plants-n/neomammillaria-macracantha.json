    "intro": "Neomammillaria macracantha, commonly known as the giant mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in distinctive, elongated tubercles that give it a unique appearance. Neomammillaria macracantha is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate."
