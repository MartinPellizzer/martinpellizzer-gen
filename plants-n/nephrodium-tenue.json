    "intro": "Nephrodium tenue, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
