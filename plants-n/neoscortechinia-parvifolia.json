    "intro": "Neoscortechinia parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf scortechinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features compact, densely branched stems with small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
