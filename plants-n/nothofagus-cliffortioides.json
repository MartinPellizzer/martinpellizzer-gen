It belongs to the Nothofagus genus, which is closely related to the beech family Fagaceae. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. This species is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native range."
