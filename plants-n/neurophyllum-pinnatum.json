    "intro": "Neurophyllum pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf neurophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Neurophyllum pinnatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
