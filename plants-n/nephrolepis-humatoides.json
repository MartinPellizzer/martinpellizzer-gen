    "intro": "Nephrolepis humatoides, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, contributing to its ornamental value in both natural and cultivated settings."
