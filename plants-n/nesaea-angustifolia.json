    "intro": "Nesaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nesaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Nesaea angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
