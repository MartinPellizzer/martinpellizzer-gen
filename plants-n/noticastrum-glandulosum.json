    "intro": "Noticastrum glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly legume, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Noticastrum glandulosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a common species in ecological restoration projects."
