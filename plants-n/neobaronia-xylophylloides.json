    "intro": "Neobaronia xylophylloides, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a unique and rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames, with vivid orange and yellow hues. The plant has specialized epiphytic growth habits, often growing on the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Neobaronia xylophylloides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators in its ecosystem."
