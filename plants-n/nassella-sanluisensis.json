    "intro": "Nassella sanluisensis, commonly known as San Luis needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to California. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological significance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
