    "intro": "Nepenthes glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture prey. The plant's pitchers are often filled with a digestive fluid that helps break down insects and other small animals. Its glandular structures along the pitcher's surface secrete enzymes and attract prey with a sweet-smelling nectar. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments."
