    "intro": "Neolloydia schmiedickeana var. schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz's neolloydia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
