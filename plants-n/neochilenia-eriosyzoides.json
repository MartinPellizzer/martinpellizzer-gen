It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features thick, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
