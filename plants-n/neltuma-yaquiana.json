    "intro": "Neltuma yaquiana, commonly known as the Yaquilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Neltuma yaquiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
