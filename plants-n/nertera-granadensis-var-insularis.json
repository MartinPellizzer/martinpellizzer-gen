    "intro": "Nertera granadensis var. insularis, commonly known as the Island Nertera, is a compact, trailing plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a decorative trailing plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
