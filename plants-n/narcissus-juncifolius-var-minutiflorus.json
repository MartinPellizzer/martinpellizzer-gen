    "intro": "Narcissus juncifolius var. minutiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf windflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
