    "intro": "Navarretia divaricata var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, and its flowers are characterized by their five narrow, spreading petals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
