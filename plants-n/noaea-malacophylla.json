    "intro": "Noaea malacophylla, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds. Noaea malacophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
