    "intro": "Nerium pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare flowering oleander, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
