    "intro": "Notocactus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in sharp, elongated spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its structure is adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures, making it well-suited for desert environments. The spines also provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration."
