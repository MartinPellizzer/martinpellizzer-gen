    "intro": "Nautilocalyx leticianus, commonly known as the Letician's nautilocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences that produce showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
