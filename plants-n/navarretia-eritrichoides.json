    "intro": "Navarretia eritrichoides, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, which is known for its hairy stems and showy flowers. Navarretia eritrichoides is typically perennial and has a short growing season, making it a distinctive and ephemeral wildflower in its habitat."
