    "intro": "Notodanthonia nuda, commonly known as the naked danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grassy slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
