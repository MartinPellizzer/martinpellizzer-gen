    "intro": "Notocactus scopa f. machadoensis, commonly known as the Machado's spiny cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
