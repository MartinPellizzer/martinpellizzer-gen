    "intro": "Neonauclea hagenii subsp. hagenii, commonly known as the Hagen's neonauclea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
