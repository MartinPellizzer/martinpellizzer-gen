    "intro": "Naron, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low-growing herb, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Naron is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
