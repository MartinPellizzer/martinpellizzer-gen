    "intro": "Nematosciadium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in composite flower heads, and are adapted for wind pollination. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. They are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh environmental conditions."
