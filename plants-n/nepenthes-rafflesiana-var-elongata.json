    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves curl into tubular structures that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. Its habitat is typically shaded and humid, with high rainfall, which supports its growth. The variety is notable for its striking red and green coloration, which helps in attracting prey."
