    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 planicorona, commonly known as the flat-crown daffodil, is a hybrid perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, flat-crown shape, which distinguishes it from other daffodil varieties. The plant produces one to three showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a narrow, elongated corona. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardiness and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking early spring color."
