    "intro": "Nassella barrancaensis, commonly known as the Barranca needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
