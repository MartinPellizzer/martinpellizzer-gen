    "intro": "Nepenthes boschiana var. lowii, commonly known as the Low's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with filtered sunlight, often growing in mountainous rainforests. Its pitchers are typically green or red in color, depending on light exposure, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. This variant is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems."
