    "intro": "Narcissus tazetta var. varians, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, tall flower stalks that bear multiple overlapping, cup-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces a strong, spicy fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
