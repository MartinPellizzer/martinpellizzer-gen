    "intro": "Najas, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Najadaceae. These plants are characterized by their whorled arrangement of leaves and their ability to thrive in freshwater environments. Najas species are often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes. They have small, green, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters near the water's surface."
