    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 odorus, commonly known as the sweetly scented daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, fragrant aroma that sets it apart from other daffodil varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and aromatic value. This hybrid is particularly valued for its ability to bloom early in the spring, adding color and fragrance to gardens during the transition from winter to summer."
