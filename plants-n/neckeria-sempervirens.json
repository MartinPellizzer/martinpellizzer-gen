It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth pattern and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, capsule-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Neckeria sempervirens is often found in moist, rocky areas or on decaying wood. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
