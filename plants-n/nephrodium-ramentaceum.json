    "intro": "Nephrodium ramentaceum, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance, with small, clustered fronds that resemble a carpet of green foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded, humid forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, releasing spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Nephrodium ramentaceum is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
