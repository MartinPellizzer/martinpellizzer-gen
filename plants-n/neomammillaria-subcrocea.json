It is characterized by its cylindrical stems with prominent, narrow ribs and white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
