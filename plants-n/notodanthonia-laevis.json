    "intro": "Notodanthonia laevis, commonly known as the smooth silky grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Notodanthonia laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
