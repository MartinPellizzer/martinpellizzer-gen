    "intro": "Nomocharis gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
