    "intro": "Nassella inconspicua, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Nassella inconspicua is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
