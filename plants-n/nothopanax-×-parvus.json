    "intro": "Nothopanax \u00d7 parvus, commonly known as the hybrid spondias, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Spondias mombinensis* and *Spondias pinnata*. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits similar to those of its parent species. Nothopanax \u00d7 parvus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Spondias genus."
