    "intro": "Nelipus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often hidden within a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. Nelipus is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
