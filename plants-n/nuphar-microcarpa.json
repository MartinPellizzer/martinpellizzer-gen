    "intro": "Nuphar microcarpa, commonly known as the small-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a layer on the water surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nuphar microcarpa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
