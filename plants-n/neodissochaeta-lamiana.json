It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Neodissochaeta lamiana is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
