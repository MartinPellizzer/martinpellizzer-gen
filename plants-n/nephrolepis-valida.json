    "intro": "Nephrolepis valida, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Nephrolepis valida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
