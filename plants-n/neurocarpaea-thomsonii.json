    "intro": "Neurocarpaea thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's neurocarpaea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
