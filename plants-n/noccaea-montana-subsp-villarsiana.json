    "intro": "Noccaea montana subsp. villarsiana, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
