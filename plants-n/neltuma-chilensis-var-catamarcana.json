    "intro": "Neltuma chilensis var. catamarcana, commonly known as the Catamarcan chilean neltuma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
