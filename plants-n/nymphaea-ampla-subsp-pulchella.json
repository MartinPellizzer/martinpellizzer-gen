    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla subsp. pulchella, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-lily species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, waxy green leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for aquatic life. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are nocturnal, opening at night and closing during the day, a unique adaptation to its pollination strategy."
