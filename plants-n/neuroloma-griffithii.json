    "intro": "Neuroloma griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
