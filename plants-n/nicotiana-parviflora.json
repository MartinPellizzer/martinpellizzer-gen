    "intro": "Nicotiana parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink or white. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive appearance and ease of care. The leaves are typically hairy and have a mild tobacco-like scent, which is a trait shared with other members of the Nicotiana genus."
