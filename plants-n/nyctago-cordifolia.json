    "intro": "Nyctago cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces violet-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
