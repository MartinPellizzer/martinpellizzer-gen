    "intro": "Nephrodium beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's nephroid, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium beddomei is considered a critically endangered species."
