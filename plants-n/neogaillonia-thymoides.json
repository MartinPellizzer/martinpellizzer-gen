    "intro": "Neogaillonia thymoides, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are similar in appearance to those of thyme, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators. Neogaillonia thymoides is also sometimes used in herbal remedies due to its medicinal properties."
