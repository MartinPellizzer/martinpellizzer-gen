    "intro": "Neomammillaria parkinsonii var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of short, white to pale green spines, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative cactus."
