    "intro": "Nerine marginata, commonly known as the white squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It features striking, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that emerges in early spring. Its bulbs are perennial and produce offsets, allowing the plant to spread over time. Nerine marginata is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
