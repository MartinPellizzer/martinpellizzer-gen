It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
