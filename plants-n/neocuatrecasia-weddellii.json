    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's neocuatrecasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to cold, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds via wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
