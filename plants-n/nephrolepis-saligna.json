It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Nephrolepis saligna plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
