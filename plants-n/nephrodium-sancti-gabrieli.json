    "intro": "Nephrodium sancti-gabrieli, commonly known as the Saint Gabriel's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with sporangia developing on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
