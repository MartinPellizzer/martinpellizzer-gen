    "intro": "Navarretia panochensis, commonly known as the Panchoche flower, is a rare annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and cruciform petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces numerous tiny white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
