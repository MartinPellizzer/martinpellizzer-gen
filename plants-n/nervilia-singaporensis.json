    "intro": "Nervilia singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore nerve orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant bloom that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Nervilia singaporensis is considered endangered and is protected in its natural range."
