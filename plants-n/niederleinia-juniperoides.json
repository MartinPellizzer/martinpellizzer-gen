    "intro": "Niederleinia juniperoides, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with needle-like leaves that are dark green and aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for various birds. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
