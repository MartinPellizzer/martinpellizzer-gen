    "intro": "Nylandtia scoparia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Nylandtia scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
