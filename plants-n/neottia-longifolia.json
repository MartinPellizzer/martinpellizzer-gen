    "intro": "Neottia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, pale green or white flower. Neottia longifolia is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant ecology and parasitism."
