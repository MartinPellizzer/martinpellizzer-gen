    "intro": "Nopalea guatemalensis, commonly known as Guatemalan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, although they are typically smaller and less commonly consumed than those of other prickly pear species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Nopalea guatemalensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
