    "intro": "Neooreophilus destitutus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees or in the canopy of dense forests. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specialized habitat and declining environment, it is considered a critically endangered species."
