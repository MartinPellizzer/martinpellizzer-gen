    "intro": "Nephrodium parasiticum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden parasitic fern, is a unique vascular plant that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots or stems of other plants. The plant's structure consists of a short, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often golden in color, giving it its common name. It is native to tropical regions and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a niche role in ecosystem dynamics, though its ecological impact remains understudied."
