    "intro": "Niedenzuella multiglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, with opposite leaves that have a distinctive serrated edge. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to play a role in the plant's defense against herbivores and moisture retention."
