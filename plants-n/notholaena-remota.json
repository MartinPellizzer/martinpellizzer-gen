    "intro": "Notholaena remota, commonly known as the remote notholaena, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically measure between 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense clusters. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notholaena remota is considered a species of conservation concern."
