    "intro": "Nassella torquata, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Nassella torquata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
