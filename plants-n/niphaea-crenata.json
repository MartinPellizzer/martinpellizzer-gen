    "intro": "Niphaea crenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces dark, oval-shaped seeds. Niphaea crenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
