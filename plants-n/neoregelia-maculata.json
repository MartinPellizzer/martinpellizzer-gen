    "intro": "Neoregelia maculata, commonly known as the spotted bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful rosette of broad, waxy leaves that often feature distinctive spots or stripes. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem that bears clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Neoregelia maculata thrives in humid, bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
