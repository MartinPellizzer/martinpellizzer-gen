    "intro": "Nasturtium thaliana, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, edible leaves that have a peppery taste, similar to that of watercress. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with five petals, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Nasturtium thaliana is not only a culinary herb but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
