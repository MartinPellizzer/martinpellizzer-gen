    "intro": "Nasturtium orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican watercress, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, and its bright orange or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Nasturtium orizabae is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional Mexican cuisine and herbal medicine."
