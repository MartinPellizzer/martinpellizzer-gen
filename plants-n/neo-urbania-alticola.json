    "intro": "Neo-urbania alticola, commonly known as the urban canopy plant, is a hardy species adapted to thrive in urban environments. It features broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in dry, polluted air. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its deep root system makes it effective at stabilizing soil and filtering contaminants. Neo-urbania alticola is often used in green infrastructure projects to enhance urban biodiversity and air quality."
