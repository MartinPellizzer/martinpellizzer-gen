    "intro": "Nepenthes garrawayae, commonly known as the Garraway's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
