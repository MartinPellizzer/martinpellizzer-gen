    "intro": "Nicotiana brachysolen, commonly known as the short-stalked tobacco plant, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically violet or blue, with a tubular corolla and five lobes, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains alkaloids, though it is not as economically significant as other Nicotiana species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a subject of botanical interest."
