    "intro": "Notholaena velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces delicate, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Notholaena velutina is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
