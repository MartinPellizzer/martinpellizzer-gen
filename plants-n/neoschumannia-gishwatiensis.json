    "intro": "Neoschumannia gishwatiensis, commonly known as the Gishwatiensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
