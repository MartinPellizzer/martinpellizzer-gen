    "intro": "Nuphar advena subsp. typica, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are usually yellow-green in color and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the water surface. The yellow water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
