    "intro": "Nymphaea affinis, commonly known as the African white lotus, is a water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, white petals and dark green, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea affinis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
