    "intro": "Nymphoides walshiae, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Nymphoides walshiae is valued in ornamental ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
