    "intro": "Neobassia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and have a silvery or whitish underside. Neobassia species typically produce small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
