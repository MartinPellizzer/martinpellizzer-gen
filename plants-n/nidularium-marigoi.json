    "intro": "Nidularium marigoi, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that resemble stars. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Nidularium marigoi is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
