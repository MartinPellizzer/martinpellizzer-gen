    "intro": "Nemampsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the air, allowing it to colonize new areas. Nemampsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
