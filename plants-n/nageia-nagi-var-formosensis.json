It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its cones are small and clustered, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
