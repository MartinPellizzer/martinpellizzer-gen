    "intro": "Nolana crassulifolia subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the woolly flaxflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
