    "intro": "Notodanthonia mera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Notodanthonia mera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
