    "intro": "Neottia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces a single, spike-like inflorescence bearing several small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in two rows along the stem. Neottia cordata is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi."
