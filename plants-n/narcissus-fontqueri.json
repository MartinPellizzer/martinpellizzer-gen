    "intro": "Narcissus fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it grows in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with a prominent central corona. It is a perennial herb with narrow, strap-like leaves and is often found in moist, well-drained environments. The botanical characteristics of Narcissus fontqueri make it a distinctive and valuable addition to native plant gardens."
