    "intro": "Nymphaea bella, commonly known as the white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Nymphaea bella plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
