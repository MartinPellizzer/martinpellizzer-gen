    "intro": "Neomarica sancti-vicentei, commonly known as the San Vicente orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and pink hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
