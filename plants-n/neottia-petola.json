    "intro": "Neottia petola, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia petola is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with leaves and flowers arising directly from the rhizome."
