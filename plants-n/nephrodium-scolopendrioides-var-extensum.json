    "intro": "Nephrodium scolopendrioides var. extensum, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a climbing fern characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations for efficient spore dispersal and nutrient absorption in its natural habitat."
