    "intro": "Neltuma pallida, commonly known as the pale neltuma, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Neltuma pallida is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
