    "intro": "Neurogramma hispida, commonly known as the hispid fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading along the ground. Neurogramma hispida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
