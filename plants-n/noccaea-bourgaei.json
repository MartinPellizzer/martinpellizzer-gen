    "intro": "Noccaea bourgaei, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in its saline, coastal environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Noccaea bourgaei is adapted to tolerate high salinity and wind exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats."
