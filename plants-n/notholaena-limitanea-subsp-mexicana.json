    "intro": "Notholaena limitanea subsp. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in high-altitude environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, clustered structures on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
