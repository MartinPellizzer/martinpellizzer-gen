    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium f. filifolius, commonly known as the filifolius narcissus, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the narcissus family. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to typical narcissus plants. The flowers are usually small and yellow, with a subtle fragrance, and they bloom in early spring. This form is a natural variation of Narcissus bulbocodium, native to southern Europe. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and modest floral display, making it a sought-after plant among bulb enthusiasts."
