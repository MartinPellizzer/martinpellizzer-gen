    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus dentata, commonly known as the lotus water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea lotus dentata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
