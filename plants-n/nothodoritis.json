    "intro": "Nothodoritis, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange inflorescences, which consist of numerous small flowers arranged in a composite head. Nothodoritis species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. They play an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Nothodoritis glabrata being one of the most widely recognized."
