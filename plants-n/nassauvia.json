    "intro": "Nassauvia, commonly known as redroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the southwestern United States and Mexico. These plants typically have basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. The genus is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish stems, which are often the most noticeable feature. Nassauvia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
