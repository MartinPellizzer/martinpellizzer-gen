    "intro": "Neblinaria, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found near mountain streams or in cloud forests. Its unique ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its humid, misty habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Neblinaria is considered a conservation concern."
