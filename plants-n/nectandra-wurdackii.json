    "intro": "Nectandra wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing smooth, shiny seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
