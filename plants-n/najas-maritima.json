    "intro": "Najas maritima, commonly known as sea needle, is a submerged aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by water, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Najas maritima is an important component of marine and coastal ecosystems."
