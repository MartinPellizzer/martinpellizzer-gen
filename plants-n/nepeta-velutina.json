    "intro": "Nepeta velutina, commonly known as velvet catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Nepeta velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
