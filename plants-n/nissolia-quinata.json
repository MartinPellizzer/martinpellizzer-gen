    "intro": "Nissolia quinata, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to its high pectin content. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for temperate climates."
