    "intro": "Nepenthes carunculata var. robusta, commonly known as the giant tawny pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, reddish-brown pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluid at the base of the pitcher. Its unique morphology includes a prominent carunculate structure, which is a fleshy, waxy appendage at the throat of the pitcher. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
