    "intro": "Nepenthes sandakanensis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-brown pitchers that are covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant's pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insect prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a central vein that leads into the pitcher. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and specialized adaptations for survival in its tropical habitat."
