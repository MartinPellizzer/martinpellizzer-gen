    "intro": "Narcissus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a yellow perianth and a white or green corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like leaves that are broader than those of most other narcissus species. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Narcissus latifolius is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
