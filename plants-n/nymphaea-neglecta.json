    "intro": "Nymphaea neglecta, commonly known as the neglected water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while its leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface. Nymphaea neglecta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
