It typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has a low stature, with slender stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like blades and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is noted for its resilience and ability to form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
