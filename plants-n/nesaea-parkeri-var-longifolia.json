    "intro": "Nesaea parkeri var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved nesaea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding vibrant color to its native environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
