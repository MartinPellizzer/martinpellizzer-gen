    "intro": "Nemexia biltmoreana, commonly known as the Biltmore's nemexia, is a flowering plant native to California, specifically found in the coastal regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
