    "intro": "Niphobolus acrocarpus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, drupaceous fruits. Niphobolus acrocarpus is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
