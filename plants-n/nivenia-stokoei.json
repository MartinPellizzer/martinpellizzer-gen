    "intro": "Nivenia stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's nivenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. Nivenia stokoei is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
