    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. kesticus, commonly known as the Kestic narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
