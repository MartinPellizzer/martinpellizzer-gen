    "intro": "Nephrodium griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, and requires a humid, shaded habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrodium griffithii plays an important ecological role in maintaining aquatic biodiversity."
