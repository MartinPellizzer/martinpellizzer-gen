    "intro": "Nidularium myrmecophilum f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup to collect rainwater. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the leaf axils and help protect the plant from herbivores. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
