    "intro": "Narcissus bicolor var. concolor, commonly known as the white narcissus, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its single, white, trumpet-shaped flower with a yellow throat, which distinguishes it from other narcissus varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, often around March or April, and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. This variety is valued for its elegant appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
