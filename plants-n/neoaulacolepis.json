    "intro": "Neoaulacolepis, commonly known as the spike moss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales. These plants are characterized by their small, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of their stems. Neoaulacolepis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They lack true leaves and instead have whorls of small, scale-like structures called microphylls. The genus is considered ancient, with fossils dating back to the Carboniferous period, indicating its long evolutionary history."
