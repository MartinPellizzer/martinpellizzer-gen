    "intro": "Nicotiana humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other tobacco species. Nicotiana humilis is also notable for its potential use in scientific research due to its genetic similarities to Nicotiana tabacum, the common tobacco plant."
