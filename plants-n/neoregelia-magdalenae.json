    "intro": "Neoregelia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It features vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage that collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Neoregelia magdalenae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
