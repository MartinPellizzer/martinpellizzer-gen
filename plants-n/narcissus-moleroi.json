    "intro": "Narcissus moleroi, commonly known as the Albufera daffodil, is a rare and striking species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. It blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
