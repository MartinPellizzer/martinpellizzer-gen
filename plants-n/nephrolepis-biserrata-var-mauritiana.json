    "intro": "Nephrolepis biserrata var. mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius hair fern, is a variety of the common sword fern. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common to many ferns. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
