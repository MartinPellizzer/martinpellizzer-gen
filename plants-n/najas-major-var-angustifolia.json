    "intro": "Najas major var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has slender, branching stems with small, whorled leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
