    "intro": "Neocupressus arizonica var. montana, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, forming dense, conical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact form and aromatic foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
