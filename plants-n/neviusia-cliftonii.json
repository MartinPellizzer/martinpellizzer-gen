    "intro": "Neviusia cliftonii, commonly known as Clifton's neviusia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to its arid and semi-arid habitat, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
