    "intro": "Neophloga lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red to orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Neophloga lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
