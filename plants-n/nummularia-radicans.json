It features succulent, round, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
