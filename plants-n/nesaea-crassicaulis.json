    "intro": "Nesaea crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed nesaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring robust, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. Nesaea crassicaulis is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
