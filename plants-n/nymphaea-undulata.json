    "intro": "Nymphaea undulata, commonly known as the wavy water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its leaves remain buoyant on the surface. The wavy water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
