    "intro": "Narcissus confusus, commonly known as the confused daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped corona atop its yellow petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
