    "intro": "Nuphar oguraensis var. akiensis, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically with five petals and a prominent yellow center. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in the sediment and absorb nutrients from the water."
