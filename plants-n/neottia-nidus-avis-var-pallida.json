    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white, leaf-like structures that often resemble leaves rather than true leaves, and it lacks the typical green foliage of most orchids. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
