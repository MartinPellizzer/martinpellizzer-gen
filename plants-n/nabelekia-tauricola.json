    "intro": "Nabelekia tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and parts of Russia. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in steppes and semi-desert environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Nabelekia tauricola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
