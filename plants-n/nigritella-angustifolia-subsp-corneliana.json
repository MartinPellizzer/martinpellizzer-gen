    "intro": "Nigritella angustifolia subsp. corneliana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nigritella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
