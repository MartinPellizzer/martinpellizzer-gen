    "intro": "Nephrodium jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium jordanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
