It is characterized by its distinctive, muted yellow flowers with a darker, almost sooty center, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bloom period occurs in early spring, usually between March and April. This form is prized for its unusual coloration and is often cultivated in specialized gardens for its ornamental value."
