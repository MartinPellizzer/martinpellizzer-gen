    "intro": "Neobartlettia kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's neobartlettia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in panicles. Neobartlettia kuhlmannii is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
