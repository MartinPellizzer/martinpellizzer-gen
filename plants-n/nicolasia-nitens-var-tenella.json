    "intro": "Nicolasia nitens var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nicolasia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
