    "intro": "Neoraimondia arequipensis var. riomajensis, commonly known as the Riomaj\u00e9nense plant, is a rare species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
