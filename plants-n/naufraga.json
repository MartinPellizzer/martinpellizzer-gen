    "intro": "Naufraga, commonly known as the \"water orchid,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture. Naufraga thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
