    "intro": "Nageia mannii var. dawei, commonly known as the dwarf nageia, is a rare and endemic tree species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and conical shape. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its habitat, thriving in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soils. Its cones are typically small and clustered, containing both male and female reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
