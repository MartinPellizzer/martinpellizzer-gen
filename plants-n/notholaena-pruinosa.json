    "intro": "Notholaena pruinosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually alternate and pinnately compound, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. Notholaena pruinosa produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of its fern-like morphology."
