    "intro": "Nymphaea divaricata, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea divaricata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
