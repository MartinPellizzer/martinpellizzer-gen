    "intro": "Najas brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often found in shallow, slow-moving waters. Its leaves are narrow and whorled, typically arranged in sets of three to four around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by buoyant, waxy fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Najas brevistyla plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish."
