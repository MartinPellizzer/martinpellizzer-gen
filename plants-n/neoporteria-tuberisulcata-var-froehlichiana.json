    "intro": "Neoporteria tuberisulcata var. froehlichiana, commonly known as the Froehlich's tuberous lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant features a robust tuberous root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
