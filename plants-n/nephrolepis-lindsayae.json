    "intro": "Nephrolepis lindsayae, commonly known as Lindsay's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
