    "intro": "Notylia trisepala, commonly known as the three-lobed everlet, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Notylia trisepala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
