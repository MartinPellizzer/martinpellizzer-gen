    "intro": "Nepenthes latiffiana, commonly known as the Malay giant pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Nepenthes latiffiana plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its native habitat."
