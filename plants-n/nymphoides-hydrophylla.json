    "intro": "Nymphoides hydrophylla, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Nymphoides, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in shallow water and nutrient-rich sediments. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, while its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Nymphoides hydrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
