It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant typically reaches a height of 20\u201350 cm and produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its tiny seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
