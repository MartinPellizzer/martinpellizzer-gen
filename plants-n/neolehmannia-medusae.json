    "intro": "Neolehmannia medusae, commonly known as the jellyfish plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that resemble the shape of a jellyfish, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom on tall, upright stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
