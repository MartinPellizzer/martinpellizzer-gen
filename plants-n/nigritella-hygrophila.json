    "intro": "Nigritella hygrophila, commonly known as the water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, star-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to absorb nutrients from water. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by water currents rather than insects. Its rhizomes help stabilize mud and sediment in aquatic ecosystems. Nigritella hygrophila plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
