    "intro": "Neottia fukuyamae, commonly known as the Fukuyama's twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, unbranched stem that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces a single, spike-like inflorescence bearing several small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
