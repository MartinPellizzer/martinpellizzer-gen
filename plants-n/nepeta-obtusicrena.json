    "intro": "Nepeta obtusicrena, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a chemical that attracts cats and influences their behavior. Nepeta obtusicrena is often grown as an ornamental plant and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
