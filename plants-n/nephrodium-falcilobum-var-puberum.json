    "intro": "Nephrodium falcilobum var. puberum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a variant of the falcilobum species within the Nephrodium genus. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with the terminal pinnae often curved or falcate in shape. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
