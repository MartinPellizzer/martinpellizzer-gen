    "intro": "Negripteris, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a genus of fossil plants that dates back to the Carboniferous period. These plants are characterized by their complex fronds and spore-producing structures, indicating a sophisticated reproductive system. Negripteris fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, suggesting they thrived in swampy, tropical environments. The genus is significant in paleobotany for its role in understanding early plant evolution and ecosystem dynamics. Its morphology provides insights into the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life."
