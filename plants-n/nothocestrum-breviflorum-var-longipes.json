    "intro": "Nothocestrum breviflorum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-flowered false pepper, is a rare variant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
