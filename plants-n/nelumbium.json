It is characterized by its large, showy, water-lily-like flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are round and float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged. Nelumbium has been culturally and religiously significant in various civilizations for centuries."
