    "intro": "Nephrodium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its intricate, kidney-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium intermedium is considered a conservation concern."
