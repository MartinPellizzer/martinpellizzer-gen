    "intro": "Nepenthes tentaculata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often reddish-colored pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to trap prey. The plant's leaves are modified into the specialized digestive structures, which are adapted to capture and digest insects. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its striking appearance."
