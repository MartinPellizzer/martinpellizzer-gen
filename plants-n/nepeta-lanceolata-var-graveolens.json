    "intro": "Nepeta lanceolata var. graveolens, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, particularly the presence of nepetalactone, which attracts cats. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal use."
