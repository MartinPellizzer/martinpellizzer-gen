    "intro": "Narthecium pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a diminutive flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant is often found in moist, sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, while its roots are specialized for anchoring in rocky substrates. Narthecium pusillum is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its cold, high-altitude habitat."
