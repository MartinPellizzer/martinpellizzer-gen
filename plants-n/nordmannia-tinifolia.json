    "intro": "Nordmannia tinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Nordmannia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas, often growing at high altitudes. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a compact growth habit, which help it survive in its harsh, alpine environment. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
