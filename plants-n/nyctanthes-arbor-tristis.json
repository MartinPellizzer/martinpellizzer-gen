It is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet scent. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Nyctanthes arbor-tristis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
