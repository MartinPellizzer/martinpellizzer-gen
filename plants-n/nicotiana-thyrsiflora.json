    "intro": "Nicotiana thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thrysoflora tobacco, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers, which are arranged in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other Nicotiana species."
