    "intro": "Nasturtium nasturtium-aquaticum, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a semi-aquatic species that typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, branching stems that often root in water, and its leaves are alternate, serrated, and edible. Its small, bright yellow flowers are followed by heart-shaped, peppery-tasting seeds. Watercress is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine and cuisine for centuries."
