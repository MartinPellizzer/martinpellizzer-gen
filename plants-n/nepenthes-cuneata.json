    "intro": "Nepenthes cuneata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often reddish-colored pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically upright and have a wide opening, which helps in trapping prey. Nepenthes cuneata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
