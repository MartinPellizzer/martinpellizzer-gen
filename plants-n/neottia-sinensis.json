    "intro": "Neottia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a short, narrow spur. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem. Neottia sinensis is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
