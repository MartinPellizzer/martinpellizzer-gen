It features narrow, stiff leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscapes in arid regions."
