    "intro": "Nolina erumpens var. compacta, commonly known as the compact nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear at the base of the leaf clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. This variety is prized for its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
