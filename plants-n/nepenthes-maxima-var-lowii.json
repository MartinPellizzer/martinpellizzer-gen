    "intro": "Nepenthes maxima var. lowii, commonly known as the giant Malaysian pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the trap and are digested by the plant. Its pitchers are typically green with a red or orange rim, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is notable for its size and unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils."
