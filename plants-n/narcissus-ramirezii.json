    "intro": "Narcissus ramirezii, commonly known as the Ramirez daffodil, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
