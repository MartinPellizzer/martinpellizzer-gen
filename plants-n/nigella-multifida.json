It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. The seeds are sometimes used in culinary applications, adding a slightly spicy flavor to dishes."
