    "intro": "Nestlera, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Nestlera is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
