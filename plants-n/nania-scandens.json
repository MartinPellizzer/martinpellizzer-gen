    "intro": "Nania scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to climb using its aerial roots. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain species, though this trait may vary. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Nania scandens plays a vital ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
