    "intro": "Nocca mociniana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Nocca mociniana has been introduced to other regions, where it sometimes becomes an invasive species."
