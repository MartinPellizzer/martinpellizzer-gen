    "intro": "Neoabbottia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Neoabbottia is considered a conservation concern."
