    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 rubromaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange spots on the pitcher's rim, which are more pronounced in younger plants. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. This hybrid is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and carnivorous habits."
