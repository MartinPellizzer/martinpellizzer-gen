    "intro": "Neotorularia dentata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered toothed lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive leaf-like thallus. It features a pale to dark green upper surface with a granular texture and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The species is known for its large, prominent lobes and serrated margins, which give it its common name. It typically grows on bark and rock surfaces in temperate forests. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
