    "intro": "Najas marina var. multidentata, commonly known as the slender watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Its rapid growth can make it an invasive species in some regions, impacting native aquatic ecosystems."
