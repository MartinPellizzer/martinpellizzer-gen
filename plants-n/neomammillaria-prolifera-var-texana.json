    "intro": "Neomammillaria prolifera var. texana, commonly known as the Texas glover cactus, is a species of cactus native to the United States, specifically Texas. It is characterized by its compact, globose shape and features a ribbed stem covered in small, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
