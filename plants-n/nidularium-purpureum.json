    "intro": "Nidularium purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in saturated soils. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters. Nidularium purpureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
