    "intro": "Nocca, commonly known as the \"pencil plant,\" is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that resemble pencils, hence its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Nocca thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
