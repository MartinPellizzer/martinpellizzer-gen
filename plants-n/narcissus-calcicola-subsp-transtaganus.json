    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. transtaganus, commonly known as the Transcaucasian daffodil, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to calcareous soils. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, including parts of Georgia and Turkey. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in early spring. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
