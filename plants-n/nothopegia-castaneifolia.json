It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that resemble chestnut leaves in appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
