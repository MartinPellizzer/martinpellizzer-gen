    "intro": "Neriacanthus harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's neriacanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
