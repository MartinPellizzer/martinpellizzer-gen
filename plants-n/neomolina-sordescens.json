    "intro": "Neomolina sordescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a lithophyte, growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neomolina sordescens is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
