    "intro": "Notholaena lasiopteris, commonly known as the silky fringed fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairs on the fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Notholaena lasiopteris thrives in humid, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight."
