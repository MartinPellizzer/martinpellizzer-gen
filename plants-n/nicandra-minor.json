    "intro": "Nicandra minor, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often opening in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, sunny conditions with well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading nature."
