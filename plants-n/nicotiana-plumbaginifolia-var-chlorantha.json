    "intro": "Nicotiana plumbaginifolia var. chlorantha, commonly known as the chloranthic tobacco plant, is a variant of the tobacco plant native to South America. It is characterized by its strikingly colored leaves, which often exhibit a unique chlorophyll variation leading to a variegated appearance. The plant is a herbaceous annual with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities and is also studied for its genetic traits related to nicotine production."
