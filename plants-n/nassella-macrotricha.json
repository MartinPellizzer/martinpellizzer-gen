    "intro": "Nassella macrotricha, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
