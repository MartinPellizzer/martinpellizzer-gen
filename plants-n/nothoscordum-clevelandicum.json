    "intro": "Nothoscordum clevelandicum, commonly known as the Cleveland onion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous roots are edible and resemble those of the true onions, though it is not closely related to the Allium genus. Nothoscordum clevelandicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, onion-like flavor."
