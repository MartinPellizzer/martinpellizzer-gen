    "intro": "Narcissus tazetta var. pancratiformis, commonly known as the Persian daffodil, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It produces clusters of fragrant, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms. This variety is more compact than the standard narcissus, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces."
