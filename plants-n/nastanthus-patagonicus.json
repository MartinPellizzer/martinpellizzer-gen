    "intro": "Nastanthus patagonicus, commonly known as the Patagonian nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to its harsh native environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nastanthus patagonicus is also valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
