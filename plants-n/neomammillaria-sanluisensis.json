    "intro": "Neomammillaria sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and botanical collections."
