    "intro": "Nervilia campestris, commonly known as the field fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often spirally arranged leaves that give it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Nervilia campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
