    "intro": "Neurolaena pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by orange to red berries. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
