It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often mistaken for flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Neoregelia mooreana is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
