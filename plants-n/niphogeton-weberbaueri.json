    "intro": "Niphogeton weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's grass, is a flowering plant species native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
