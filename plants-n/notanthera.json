It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Notanthera species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. They are also valued for their aromatic properties and traditional uses by indigenous communities."
