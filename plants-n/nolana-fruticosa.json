    "intro": "Nolana fruticosa, commonly known as the silver flax or coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Nolana fruticosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
