It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Navarretia cotulifolia is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with full sun exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
