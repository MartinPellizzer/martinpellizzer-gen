    "intro": "Neomarica involuta, commonly known as the pink spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that bears numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Neomarica involuta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
