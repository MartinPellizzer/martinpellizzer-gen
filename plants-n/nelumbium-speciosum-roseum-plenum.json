It features large, showy flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose, with a distinctive white center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This species is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and cultural significance."
