    "intro": "Nicipe schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's nicipe, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
