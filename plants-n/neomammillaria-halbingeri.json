    "intro": "Neomammillaria halbingeri, commonly known as the Halbinger's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, and it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Neomammillaria halbingeri is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
