    "intro": "Nemophila alata, commonly known as the trailing blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically with five petals and a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, often covered in fine, soft pubescence. Nemophila alata thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
