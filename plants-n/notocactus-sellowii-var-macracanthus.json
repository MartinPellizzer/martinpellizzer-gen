    "intro": "Notocactus sellowii var. macracanthus, commonly known as the Sellow's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
