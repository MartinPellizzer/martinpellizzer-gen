    "intro": "Neomammillaria tolimensis var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined tolimensis cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Colombia. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles covered in white to pale yellow bristles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
