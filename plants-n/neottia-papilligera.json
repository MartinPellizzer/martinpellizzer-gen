    "intro": "Neottia papilligera, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic in some regions, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Neottia papilligera has a specialized root system that forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its often shaded and humid habitats."
