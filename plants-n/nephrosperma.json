    "intro": "Nephrosperma, commonly known as the mountain daisy or bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. Nephrosperma species typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They have a rosette growth habit with basal leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
