    "intro": "Nothotsuga longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract hemlock, is a hybrid coniferous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a sterile hybrid between Tsuga heterophylla (Douglas fir) and Tsuga caroliniana (Carolina hemlock). The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including needle-like leaves and a conical shape. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
