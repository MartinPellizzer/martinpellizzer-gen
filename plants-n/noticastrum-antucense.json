    "intro": "Noticastrum antucense, commonly known as the Antuco tree, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Paraguay. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and palmately lobed, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other members of the family. Noticastrum antucense is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
