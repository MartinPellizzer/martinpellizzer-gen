    "intro": "Nothoscordum bivalve var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf false garlic, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bulbous structures similar to true garlic, though they are not edible. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
