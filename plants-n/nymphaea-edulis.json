    "intro": "Nymphaea edulis, commonly known as the water caladium, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, pink, and white. The plant produces showy, water-lily-like flowers that are typically pink or white, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used in local cuisines for their mild, nutty flavor. Nymphaea edulis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular ornamental and culinary plant in tropical horticulture."
