    "intro": "Nidularium correia-araujoi, commonly known as the Correia-Araujo's air plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its foliage is usually green with a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal."
