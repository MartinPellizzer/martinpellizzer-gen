It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
