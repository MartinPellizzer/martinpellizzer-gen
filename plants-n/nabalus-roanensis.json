    "intro": "Nabalus roanensis, commonly known as the Roan mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Roan Highlands in Texas. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nabalus roanensis is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous environment."
