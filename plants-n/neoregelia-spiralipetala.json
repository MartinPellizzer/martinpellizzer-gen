    "intro": "Neoregelia spiralipetala, commonly known as the spiral-leaved bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that spiral outward, creating a unique and visually appealing structure. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, with a serrated edge that helps in water retention. Neoregelia spiralipetala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
