    "intro": "Nepenthes spinosa, commonly known as the spinous pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a nutrient-rich liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's tendrils help it climb and spread through dense vegetation. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or red, attracting pollinators like flies and beetles. Nepenthes spinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
