    "intro": "Nototriche pichinchensis var. angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf nototriche, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often violet or purple in color, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
