    "intro": "Nitidobulbon proboscideum, commonly known as the giant bulbous orchid, is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bulb-like underground structures that store nutrients and water, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of white and purple. Its growth is slow and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
