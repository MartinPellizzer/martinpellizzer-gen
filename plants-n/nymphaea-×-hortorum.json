    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 hortorum, commonly known as the garden water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bed while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea \u00d7 hortorum is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
