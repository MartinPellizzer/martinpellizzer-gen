    "intro": "Neophylum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf neophylum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its broad, heart-shaped leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Neophylum latifolium is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
