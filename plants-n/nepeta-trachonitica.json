    "intro": "Nepeta trachonitica, commonly known as the mountain catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that emit a mint-like scent when crushed, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nepeta trachonitica is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential calming and antiseptic properties."
