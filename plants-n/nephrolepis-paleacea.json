    "intro": "Nephrolepis paleacea, commonly known as the pale sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Nephrolepis paleacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
