    "intro": "Notocactus erinaceus var. tephracanthus, commonly known as the spiny hedge cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
