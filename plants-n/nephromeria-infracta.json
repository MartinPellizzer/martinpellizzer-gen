    "intro": "Nephromeria infracta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Nephromeria infracta is notable for its resilience to harsh climates and is often found in alpine meadows."
