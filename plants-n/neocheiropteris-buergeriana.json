    "intro": "Neocheiropteris buergeriana, commonly known as the Buerger's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
