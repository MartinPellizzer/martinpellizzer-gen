    "intro": "Nephrolepis duffii, commonly known as the Duff's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Nephrolepis duffii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
