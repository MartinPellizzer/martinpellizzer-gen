    "intro": "Nephrodium dejectum, commonly known as the drooping kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often drooping or reflexed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. Nephrodium dejectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
