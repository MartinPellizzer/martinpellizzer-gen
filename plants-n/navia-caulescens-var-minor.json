    "intro": "Navia caulescens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser stem navia, is a lesser-known variant of the Navia caulescens species. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive botanical specimen."
