    "intro": "Nicotiana frigida, commonly known as the frostflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. Nicotiana frigida is a short-lived perennial, often blooming in late spring and early summer."
