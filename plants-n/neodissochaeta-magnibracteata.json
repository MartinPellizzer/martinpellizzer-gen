    "intro": "Neodissochaeta magnibracteata, commonly known as the large-bracted sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that attach to passing animals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Neodissochaeta magnibracteata is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
