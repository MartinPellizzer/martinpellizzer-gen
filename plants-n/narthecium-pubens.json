    "intro": "Narthecium pubens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the genus Narthecium in the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. It is adapted to thrive in arid environments, with its hairy leaves helping to reduce water loss. Narthecium pubens is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
