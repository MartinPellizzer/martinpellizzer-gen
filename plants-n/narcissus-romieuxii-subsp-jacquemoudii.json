    "intro": "Narcissus romieuxii subsp. jacquemoudii, commonly known as the Jacquemoud's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the daffodil genus. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
