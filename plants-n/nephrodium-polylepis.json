    "intro": "Nephrodium polylepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests. Its fronds are divided into numerous segments, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium polylepis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
