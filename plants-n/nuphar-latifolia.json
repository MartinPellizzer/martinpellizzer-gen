    "intro": "Nuphar latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically white or pink, with a distinct yellow center. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water. Nuphar latifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
