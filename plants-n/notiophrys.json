    "intro": "Notiophrys, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Notiophrys species typically have broad, rounded leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Their roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water bodies. The flowers of Notiophrys are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play a vital role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and water filtration."
