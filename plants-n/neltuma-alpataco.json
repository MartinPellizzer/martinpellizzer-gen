    "intro": "Neltuma alpataco, commonly known as the Andean lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in high-altitude environments, particularly in the Andes Mountains, where it forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces. This plant-like organism is well adapted to extreme conditions, including low temperatures and high UV radiation. Its structure allows it to efficiently absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Neltuma alpataco plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
