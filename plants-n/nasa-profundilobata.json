    "intro": "Nasa profundilobata, commonly known as the deep-lobed nasa, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Nasa profundilobata is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
