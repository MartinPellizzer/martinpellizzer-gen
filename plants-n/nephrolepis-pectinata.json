It features feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and can grow quite large. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically divided into smaller, delicate pinnae, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. Nephrolepis pectinata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic value."
