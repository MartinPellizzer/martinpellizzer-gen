    "intro": "Nerium indicum var. plenum, commonly known as the full-flowered oleander, is a vigorous evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of pink, red, white, or yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and the plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and long-lasting blooms."
