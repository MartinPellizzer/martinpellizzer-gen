It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage, which becomes more intense in autumn. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
