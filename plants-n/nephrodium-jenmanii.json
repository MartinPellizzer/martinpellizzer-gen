    "intro": "Nephrodium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex venation pattern. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium jenmanii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
