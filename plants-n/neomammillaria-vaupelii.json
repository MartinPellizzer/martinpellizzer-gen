    "intro": "Neomammillaria vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
