    "intro": "Nymphoides guineensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nymphoides guineensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and can also serve as a natural water purifier."
