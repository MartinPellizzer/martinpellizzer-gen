    "intro": "Nephrodium griseum, commonly known as the golden liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green to yellowish in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Nephrodium griseum reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure includes both gametophyte and sporophyte stages. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
