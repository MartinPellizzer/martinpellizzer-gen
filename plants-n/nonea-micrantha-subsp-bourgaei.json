    "intro": "Nonea micrantha subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgai's rockheath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
