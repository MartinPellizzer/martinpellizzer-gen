    "intro": "Noccaea fendleri subsp. fendleri, commonly known as desert knotweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and stems that produce small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it well-adapted to desert environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it blooms from spring to early summer. The species is often found in gravelly soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
