    "intro": "Nephrodium biseriale, commonly known as the two-rowed kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, with a broad, undulating form. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its leaves are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. Nephrodium biseriale thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
