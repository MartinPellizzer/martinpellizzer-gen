It belongs to the Tropaeolaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant orange or yellow flowers. The plant is often found growing near water sources, such as streams and wet meadows, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. Its edible leaves and flowers are used in traditional cuisine, adding a peppery flavor similar to watercress. Additionally, it is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits."
