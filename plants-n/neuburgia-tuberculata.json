    "intro": "Neuburgia tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various substrates such as bark and rock. Neuburgia tuberculata is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its morphology includes distinct tubercles and a leathery texture, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
