    "intro": "Neuropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Water Fern Family (Thelypteridaceae). These plants typically have finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in wet environments such as marshes, streams, and ponds. The rhizomes of Neuropteris species are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. They produce spores in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Neuropteris species are valued for their ecological roles in water ecosystems and their aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardening."
