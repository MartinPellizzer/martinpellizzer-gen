    "intro": "Nymphaea alba subsp. alba, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a yellow central stigma, which attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant and enabling it to spread vegetatively. Nymphaea alba subsp. alba plays an important role in water purification and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms."
