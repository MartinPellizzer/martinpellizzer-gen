    "intro": "Noronhia capuronii, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, bark-like stem and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Noronhia capuronii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
