It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive trumpet-shaped form. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late winter to early spring."
