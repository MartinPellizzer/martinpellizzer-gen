    "intro": "Nicotiana palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Palmer's tobacco is also notable for its historical use by indigenous peoples and its potential ecological importance in its native habitat."
