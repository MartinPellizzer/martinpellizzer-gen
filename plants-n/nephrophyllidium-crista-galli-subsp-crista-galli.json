    "intro": "Nephrophyllidium crista-galli subsp. crista-galli, commonly known as the common marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for true hellebores. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
