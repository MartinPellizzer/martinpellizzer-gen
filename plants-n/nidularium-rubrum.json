    "intro": "Nidularium rubrum, commonly known as the red flame bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded environment. Nidularium rubrum is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
