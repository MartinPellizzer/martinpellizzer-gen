    "intro": "Nephrodium repens, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, horizontal stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant has lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
