    "intro": "Nymphoides beaglensis, commonly known as the Beaglens water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with prominent purple markings, which bloom in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. Due to its invasive potential, it can disrupt local ecosystems if not managed properly."
