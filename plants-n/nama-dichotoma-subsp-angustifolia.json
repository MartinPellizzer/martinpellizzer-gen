    "intro": "Nama dichotoma subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nama, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and small, narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
