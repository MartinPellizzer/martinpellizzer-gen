    "intro": "Nepenthes viridis, commonly known as the green pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant green foliage and slender stems make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and greenhouses. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often found in mountainous regions. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution."
