    "intro": "Nephrolepis viridissima, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features long, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, glossy green segments, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in some varieties, though this trait is more pronounced in certain cultivars."
