    "intro": "Nervilia adolphi var. adolphi, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
