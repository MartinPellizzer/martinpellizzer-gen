    "intro": "Neooreophilus werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant thrives in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to minimize water loss, making it well-suited to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
