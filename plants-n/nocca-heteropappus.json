    "intro": "Nocca heteropappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures that aid in its spread across dry landscapes. Nocca heteropappus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
