    "intro": "Nassella rosengurttii, commonly known as the Rosengurt needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
