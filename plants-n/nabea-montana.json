    "intro": "Nabea montana, commonly known as the mountain nabea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Nabea montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
