    "intro": "Nemallosis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate nemallosis, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is of interest in wetland restoration and botanical studies."
