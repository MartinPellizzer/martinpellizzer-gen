    "intro": "Neoruschia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and showy, often violet or blue flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Neoruschia species are adapted to arid environments and often have succulent leaves to store water. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance."
