    "intro": "Nyctophylax alba, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid blooming cycle. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The flower's nocturnal behavior is an adaptation to attract night-active pollinators such as moths."
