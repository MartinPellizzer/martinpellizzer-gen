    "intro": "Nephrolepis rufescens f. tripinnatifida, commonly known as the red-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the common nephrolepis. It is characterized by its finely divided, tripinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
