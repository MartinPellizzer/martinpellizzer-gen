    "intro": "Nephrodium dilatatum var. dumetorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variant is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
