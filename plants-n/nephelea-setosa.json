    "intro": "Nephelea setosa, commonly known as the hairy nephelea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its soft, hairy texture on both its stems and leaves, which gives it its scientific name \"setosa,\" meaning \"bristly\" or \"hairy.\" Nephelea setosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
