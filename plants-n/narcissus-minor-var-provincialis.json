    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. provincialis, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a compact, bulbous perennial native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow trumpet-shaped corona. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
