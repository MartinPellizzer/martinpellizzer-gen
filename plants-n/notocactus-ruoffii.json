    "intro": "Notocactus ruoffii, commonly known as the Ruoff's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in the cactus family."
