    "intro": "Nastanthus spathulatus var. bellidifolius, commonly known as the bellidifolius variant, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
