It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
