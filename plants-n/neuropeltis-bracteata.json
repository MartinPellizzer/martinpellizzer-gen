    "intro": "Neuropeltis bracteata, commonly known as the bracted nerveplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of wetlands and marshy areas. The bracts, which are modified leaves, are often brightly colored and play a role in attracting pollinators."
