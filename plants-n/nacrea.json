    "intro": "Nacrea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers, which resemble a holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, salty environments. Its leaves are usually silver or gray-green, covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. Nacrea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
