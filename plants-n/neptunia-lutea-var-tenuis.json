It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its yellowish-green foliage helps it absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
