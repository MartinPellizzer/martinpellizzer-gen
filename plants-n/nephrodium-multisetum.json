    "intro": "Nephrodium multisetum, commonly known as the many-branched kidney fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with multiple pinnae that are often divided into smaller segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The botanical features of Nephrodium multisetum make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and evolution."
