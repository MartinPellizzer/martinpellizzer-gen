It is characterized by its striking white petals and a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is usually short and unbranched. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural habitats."
