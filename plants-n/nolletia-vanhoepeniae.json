    "intro": "Nolletia vanhoepeniae, commonly known as the Vanhoepen's nolletia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nolletia vanhoepeniae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
