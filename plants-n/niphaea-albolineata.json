    "intro": "Niphaea albolineata, commonly known as the white-lined water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often spotted with white veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Niphaea albolineata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
