    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ensata var. izuensis, commonly known as the Izu fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
