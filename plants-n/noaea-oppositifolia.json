    "intro": "Noaea oppositifolia, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are opposite in arrangement, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Noaea oppositifolia is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
