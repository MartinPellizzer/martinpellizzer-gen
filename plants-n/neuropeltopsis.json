    "intro": "Neuropeltopsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, especially when backlit. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its small, intricate leaves are adapted for moisture retention and efficient light absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
