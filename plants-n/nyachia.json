It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically features broad, waxy leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nyachia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
