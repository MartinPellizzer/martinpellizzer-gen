    "intro": "Nephrodium edentulum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests where it clings to rocky surfaces or decaying wood. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are arranged in clusters along the fronds, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium edentulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
