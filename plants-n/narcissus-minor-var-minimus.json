    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a small, bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces delicate, bright yellow flowers with a single, narrow perianth, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its compact size, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and display."
