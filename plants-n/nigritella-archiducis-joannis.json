    "intro": "Nigritella archiducis-joannis, commonly known as the Archduke's black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of the forest canopy. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a critically endangered species."
