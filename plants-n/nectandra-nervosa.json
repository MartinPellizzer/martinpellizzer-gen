    "intro": "Nectandra nervosa, commonly known as the sweet-scented wood or fragrant wood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain smooth, dark seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they emit a pleasant, spicy fragrance when crushed. Nectandra nervosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
