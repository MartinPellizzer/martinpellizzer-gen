It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture. Neoancistrophyllum is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
