    "intro": "Navia paruana, commonly known as the golden leaf plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow foliage that contrasts vividly with its dark green stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Navia paruana is typically grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
