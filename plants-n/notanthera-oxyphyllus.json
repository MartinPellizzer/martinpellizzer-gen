    "intro": "Notanthera oxyphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed notanthera, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Notanthera oxyphyllus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
