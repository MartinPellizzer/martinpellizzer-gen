    "intro": "Nissolia incorruptibilis, commonly known as the Everlasting Bloom, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, iridescent petals that change color with the time of day, ranging from deep violet in the morning to a shimmering gold at dusk. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts a unique array of pollinators, including nocturnal moths and bees. Due to its rarity and unique properties, Nissolia incorruptibilis is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
