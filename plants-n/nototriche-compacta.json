    "intro": "Nototriche compacta, commonly known as the compact nototriche, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments. Nototriche compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
