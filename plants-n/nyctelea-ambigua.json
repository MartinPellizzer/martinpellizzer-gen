    "intro": "Nyctelea ambigua, commonly known as the nightshade of the marsh, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Nyctelea ambigua is adapted to moist environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
