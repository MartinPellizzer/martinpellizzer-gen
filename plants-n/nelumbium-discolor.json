    "intro": "Nelumbium discolor, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often displaying a striking color variation from green to reddish hues. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates while supporting its extensive leaf and flower structures. Nelumbium discolor plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
