    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a shrub native to coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and periodic drought. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
