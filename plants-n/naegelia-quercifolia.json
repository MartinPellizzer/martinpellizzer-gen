    "intro": "Naegelia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved naegelia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and early summer. Naegelia quercifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
