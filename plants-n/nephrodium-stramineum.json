    "intro": "Nephrodium stramineum, commonly known as the yellow moss fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping rhizomes and its distinctive, bright yellow to greenish-yellow fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, and they often have a soft, moss-like texture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium stramineum is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
