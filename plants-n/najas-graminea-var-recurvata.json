    "intro": "Najas graminea var. recurvata, commonly known as the curly watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically coiled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting aquatic ecosystems."
