    "intro": "Nabalus fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's navelwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of New Zealand. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, contributing to its limited visibility. Nabalus fraseri thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
