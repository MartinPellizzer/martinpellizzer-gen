    "intro": "Nemallosis, commonly known as the \"bushy shoot disease,\" is a fungal disease affecting various plants, particularly ornamental and fruit-bearing species. It is caused by the fungus *Phoma nemorosa*, which infects the shoots and stems, leading to the formation of dense, bushy growths. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of short, thick shoots that replace normal growth, often resulting in a deformed appearance. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and can spread through infected plant debris or contaminated tools. Proper sanitation and resistant cultivars are essential for managing nemallosis in affected plants."
