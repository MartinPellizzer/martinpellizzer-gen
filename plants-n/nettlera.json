    "intro": "Nettlera, commonly known as the \"false nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are characterized by their opposite leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. Nettlera species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have a fibrous root system and produce small, capsule-like fruits. While not related to true nettles, they share some similar physical traits, leading to their common name."
