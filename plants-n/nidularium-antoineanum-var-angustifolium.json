    "intro": "Nidularium antoineanum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed false arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
