It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
