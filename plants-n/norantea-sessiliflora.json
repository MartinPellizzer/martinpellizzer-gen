    "intro": "Norantea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered norantea, is a flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Norantea sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
