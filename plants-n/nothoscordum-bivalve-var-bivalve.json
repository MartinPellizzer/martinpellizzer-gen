    "intro": "Nothoscordum bivalve var. bivalve, commonly known as the bivalve false garlic, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, ovoid berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
