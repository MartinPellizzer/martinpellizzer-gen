    "intro": "Nolina parryi subsp. wolfii, commonly known as the silver thread yucca, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, gray-green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
