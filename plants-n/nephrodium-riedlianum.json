    "intro": "Nephrodium riedlianum, commonly known as the Riedl's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
