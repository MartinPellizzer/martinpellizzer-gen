    "intro": "Nageia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia neriifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
