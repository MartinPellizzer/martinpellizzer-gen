    "intro": "Neoporteria horrida var. armata, commonly known as the hairy neoporteria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
