It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.
