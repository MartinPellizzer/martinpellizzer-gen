    "intro": "Neurachne alopecuroidea, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Neurachne alopecuroidea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
