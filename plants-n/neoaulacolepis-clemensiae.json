    "intro": "Neoaulacolepis clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is native to specific regions in South America and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
