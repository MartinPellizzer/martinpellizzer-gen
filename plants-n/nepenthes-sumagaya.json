    "intro": "Nepenthes sumagaya, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of green, red, or yellow, depending on light exposure. Nepenthes sumagaya plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils."
