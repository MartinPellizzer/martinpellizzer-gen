    "intro": "Neophloga lutea, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body. Neophloga lutea thrives in humid climates and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its bright yellow coloration makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
