    "intro": "Nepeta conferta, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers. The plant produces tiny, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its strong minty scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. Nepeta conferta is also known for its attractiveness to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
