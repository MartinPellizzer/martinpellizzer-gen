    "intro": "Nerisyrenia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum rockrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows on rocky soils, particularly in gypsum-rich environments, which influence its unique adaptations. Its leaves are often small and scale-like, reducing water loss in harsh conditions. Nerisyrenia gypsophila is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and is well-suited to xerophytic habitats."
