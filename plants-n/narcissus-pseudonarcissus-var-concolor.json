    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. concolor, commonly known as the common daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe. It features a single, upright stem that bears one to three large, showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of sheaths. This variety is notable for its uniform coloration, with both the petals and the corona being a consistent yellow hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
