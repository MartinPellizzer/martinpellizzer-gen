    "intro": "Niphaea pulchella, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically light green with a waxy surface. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its stems support the leaves and flowers on the water's surface. Niphaea pulchella plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
