    "intro": "Neonauclea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neonauclea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
