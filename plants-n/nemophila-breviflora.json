    "intro": "Nemophila breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual plant native to California. It produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming period, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
