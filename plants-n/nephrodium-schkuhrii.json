    "intro": "Nephrodium schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhrii nephroid, is a rare and unique member of the fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
