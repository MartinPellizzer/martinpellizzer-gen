    "intro": "Noccaea vesicaria, commonly known as bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its bright pink or red flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its inflated, bladder-like seed pods that split open when mature. Noccaea vesicaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
