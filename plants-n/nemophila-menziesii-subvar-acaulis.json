    "intro": "Nemophila menziesii subvar. acaulis, commonly known as the cushion bluebell, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to lavender. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the forest floor. This subvariety is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem, with flowers arising directly from the base of the plant."
