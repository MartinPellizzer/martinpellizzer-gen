    "intro": "Nervilia fordii, commonly known as the Ford's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia fordii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
