    "intro": "Neonauclea gigantea, commonly known as the giant neonauclea, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neonauclea gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
