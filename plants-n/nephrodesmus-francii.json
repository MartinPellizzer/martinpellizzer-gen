    "intro": "Nephrodesmus francii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a climbing habit, often using tendrils to support itself on structures or other plants. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
