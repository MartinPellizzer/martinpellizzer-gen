    "intro": "Nasturtium officinale var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, edible flowers that come in shades of orange and yellow. The plant grows low to the ground, typically reaching a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible parts. The variety is closely related to the common nasturtium, but its smaller size and unique appearance set it apart."
