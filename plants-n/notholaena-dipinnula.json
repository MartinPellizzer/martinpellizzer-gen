    "intro": "Notholaena dipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its delicate appearance and unique habitat make it a notable species in the study of fern botany."
