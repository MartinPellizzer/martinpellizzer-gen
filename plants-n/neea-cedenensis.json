    "intro": "Neea cedenensis, commonly known as the Ceden's neea, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neea cedenensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
