    "intro": "Nepeta distans, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their mild mint-like scent and potential calming properties. Nepeta distans thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
