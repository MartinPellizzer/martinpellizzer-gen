    "intro": "Nierembergia repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Nierembergia repens is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
