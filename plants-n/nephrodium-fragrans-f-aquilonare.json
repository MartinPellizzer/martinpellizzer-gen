    "intro": "Nephrodium fragrans f. aquilonare, commonly known as the aquatic nephroid, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized reproductive structures. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often displaying a striking green to bluish-green hue, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged, aiding in pollination by aquatic insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. This rare variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
