    "intro": "Nervilia kotschyi var. purpurata, commonly known as the purple-stemmed fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
