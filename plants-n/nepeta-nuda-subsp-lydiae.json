    "intro": "Nepeta nuda subsp. lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
