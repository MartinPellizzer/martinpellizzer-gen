It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow flower with a greenish tint. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family and is noted for its delicate appearance and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
