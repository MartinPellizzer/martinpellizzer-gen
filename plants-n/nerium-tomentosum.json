    "intro": "Nerium tomentosum, commonly known as the white oleander, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming throughout the growing season. The plant has soft, fuzzy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and its stems are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The white oleander is also notable for its ability to produce milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
