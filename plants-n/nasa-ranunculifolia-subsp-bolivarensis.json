    "intro": "Nasa ranunculifolia subsp. bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Andean region of Bolivia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
