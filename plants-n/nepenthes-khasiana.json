    "intro": "Nepenthes khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often reddish-colored pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to lure and trap prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that helps in the adhesion of insects. The species is also notable for its ability to produce nectar to attract specific pollinators, enhancing its ecological role in its native habitat."
