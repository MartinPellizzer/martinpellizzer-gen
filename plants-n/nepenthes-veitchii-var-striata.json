    "intro": "Nepenthes veitchii var. striata, commonly known as the striated pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with a reddish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces nectar-secreting glands on the inner surface of its pitchers to attract and trap insects. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
