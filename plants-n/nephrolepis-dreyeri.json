    "intro": "Nephrolepis dreyeri, commonly known as the Dreyer's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or clumps. Nephrolepis dreyeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
