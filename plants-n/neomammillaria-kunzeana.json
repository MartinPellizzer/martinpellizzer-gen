    "intro": "Neomammillaria kunzeana, commonly known as the Kunze's clustered cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Neomammillaria kunzeana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
