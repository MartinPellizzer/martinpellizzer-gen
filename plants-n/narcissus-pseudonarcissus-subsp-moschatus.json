    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. moschatus, commonly known as the musk narcissus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces fragrant, white flowers with a yellow corona, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The subspecies is distinguished by its strong musk-like scent, which is more pronounced than in other narcissus varieties."
