    "intro": "Nymphaea rosea, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or reddish petals that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy surface to repel water. Nymphaea rosea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
