    "intro": "Nephrodium braunianum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are evergreen and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Nephrodium braunianum is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
