    "intro": "Neoscortechinia arborea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tree fern, is a unique species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant's foliage consists of small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
