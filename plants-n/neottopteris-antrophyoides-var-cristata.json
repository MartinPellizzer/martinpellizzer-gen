    "intro": "Neottopteris antrophyoides var. cristata, commonly known as the crested shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that often exhibit a wavy or crested appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years. The botanical interest of this fern lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
