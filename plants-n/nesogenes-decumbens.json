It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
