It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, displaying compact growth and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant produces alkaloids, including nicotine, which are characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Its foliage is usually hairy, and it thrives in cool, moist conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to alpine climates."
