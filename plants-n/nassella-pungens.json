    "intro": "Nassella pungens, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and spikes of small, grass-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. Nassella pungens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
