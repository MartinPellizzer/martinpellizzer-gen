    "intro": "Nephrodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a linear pattern on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium dentatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
