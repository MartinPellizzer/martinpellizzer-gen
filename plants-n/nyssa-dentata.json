    "intro": "Nyssa dentata, commonly known as the Carolina buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Nyssaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, spiny fruit that contains a single seed. Its leaves and seeds contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical uses by Native American tribes."
