    "intro": "Nepsera aquatica, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Nepsera aquatica plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
