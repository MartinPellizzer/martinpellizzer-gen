    "intro": "Nototriche pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf nototriche, is a small, flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
