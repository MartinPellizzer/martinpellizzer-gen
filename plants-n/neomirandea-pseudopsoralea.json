    "intro": "Neomirandea pseudopsoralea, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers with four petals, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
