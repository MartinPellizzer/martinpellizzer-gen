    "intro": "Nototrichium humile, commonly known as the small-stemmed sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, hairy foliage. The plant typically has slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Nototrichium humile is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
