    "intro": "Niobe sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese rock elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks in temperate climates."
