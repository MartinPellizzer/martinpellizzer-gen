    "intro": "Nigritella karawankarum, commonly known as the Karawanka blackroot, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its dark, tuberous roots and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nigritella karawankarum is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
