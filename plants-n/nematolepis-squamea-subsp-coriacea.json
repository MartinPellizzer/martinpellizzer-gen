    "intro": "Nematolepis squamea subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the hard-leaved nematolepis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, giving them a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive member of the Poaceae family."
