    "intro": "Nephradenia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nephradenia fruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
