    "intro": "Nemoctis buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf nemoctis, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of the boxwood plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Nemoctis buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
