    "intro": "Nymphaea nouchali var. mutandaensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems support the floating foliage. The flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
