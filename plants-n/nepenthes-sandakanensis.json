    "intro": "Nepenthes sandakanensis, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy coating that enhances their visual appeal and aids in attracting prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Nepenthes sandakanensis is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain epiphytic organisms."
