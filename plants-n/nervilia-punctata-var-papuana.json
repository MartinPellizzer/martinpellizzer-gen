    "intro": "Nervilia punctata var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan nerve plant, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
