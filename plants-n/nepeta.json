    "intro": "Nepeta, commonly known as catnip, is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white in color. Nepeta species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many are cultivated for their ornamental value and aromatic properties. The plant is also well-known for its effects on cats, which are stimulated by the chemical nepetalactone found in its leaves."
