    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. flavipes, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in South America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
