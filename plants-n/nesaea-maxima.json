    "intro": "Nesaea maxima, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant hues of purple and white. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Nesaea maxima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
