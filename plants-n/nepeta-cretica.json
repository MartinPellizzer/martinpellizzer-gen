    "intro": "Nepeta cretica, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small purple or white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its attractive effect on cats. Nepeta cretica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
