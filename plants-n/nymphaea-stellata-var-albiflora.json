It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in summer. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. The white petals and yellow stamens make it a popular ornamental plant in ponds and water gardens."
