    "intro": "Narcissus cuatrecasasii var. segimonensis, commonly known as the Segimon Valley daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Segimon Valley in Spain. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
