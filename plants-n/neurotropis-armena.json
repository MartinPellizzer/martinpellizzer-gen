    "intro": "Neurotropis armena, commonly known as Armenian neurotropis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
