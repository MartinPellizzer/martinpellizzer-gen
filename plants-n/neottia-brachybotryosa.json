    "intro": "Neottia brachybotryosa, commonly known as the short-stalked bladder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lacks the typical pseudobulbs found in many orchid species. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Neottia brachybotryosa is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific flies for reproduction."
