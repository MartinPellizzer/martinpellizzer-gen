    "intro": "Nyctelea pinetorum, commonly known as the pine nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, nocturnal flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain toxic seeds. Due to its unique blooming pattern and ecological niche, it plays a role in attracting specific pollinators active at night."
