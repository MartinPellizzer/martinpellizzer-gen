    "intro": "Nephrodium fordii, commonly known as the Ford's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
