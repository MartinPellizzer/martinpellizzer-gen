    "intro": "Nyctago angulata, commonly known as the angular nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features angular, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided as a food source and is more commonly found in wild or semi-wild environments."
