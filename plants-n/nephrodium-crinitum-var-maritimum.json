    "intro": "Nephrodium crinitum var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble holly berries, surrounded by soft, fuzzy leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
