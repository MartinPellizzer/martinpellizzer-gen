    "intro": "Narcissus pachybolbus, commonly known as the broad-leaved daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces an underground bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Narcissus pachybolbus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
