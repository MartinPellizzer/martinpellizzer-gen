    "intro": "Nolina durangensis, commonly known as the Durango nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the state of Durango. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on a tall, slender stem during the spring or early summer. Nolina durangensis is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
