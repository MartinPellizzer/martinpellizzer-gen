    "intro": "Najas marina var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It has whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a slight keel or ridge along the upper surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, which emerge from the water surface during the summer months. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
