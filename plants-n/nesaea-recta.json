    "intro": "Nesaea recta, commonly known as the smoothleaf nesaea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Nesaea recta is typically perennial and has a low-growing habit, making it well adapted to its native habitat."
