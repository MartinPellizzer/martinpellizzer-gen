It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
