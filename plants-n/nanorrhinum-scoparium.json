It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its silver foliage and medicinal properties make it a notable species in its native habitat."
