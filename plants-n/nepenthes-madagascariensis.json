    "intro": "Nepenthes madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, water-filled traps to lure and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, lid-like structure that helps retain prey inside the trap. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its ecological role includes pest control and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
