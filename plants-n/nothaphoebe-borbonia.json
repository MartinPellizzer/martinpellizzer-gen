    "intro": "Nothaphoebe borbonia, commonly known as the Bourbon magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Nothaphoebe borbonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
