    "intro": "Neumannia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Neumannia sulphurea is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
