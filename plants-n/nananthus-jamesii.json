    "intro": "Nananthus jamesii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought. Nananthus jamesii plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
