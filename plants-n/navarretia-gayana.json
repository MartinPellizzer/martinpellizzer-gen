    "intro": "Navarretia gayana, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high-elevation areas, often in alpine or subalpine zones. Navarretia gayana is known for its ephemeral life cycle, with most of its growth occurring during the brief wet season. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
