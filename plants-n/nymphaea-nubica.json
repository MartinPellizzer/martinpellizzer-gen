    "intro": "Nymphaea nubica, commonly known as the cloud water lily, is a species of water lily native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
