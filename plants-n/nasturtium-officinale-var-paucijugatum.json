    "intro": "Nasturtium officinale var. paucijugatum, commonly known as the dwarf nasturtium, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. The flowers are typically bright orange or red, with five petals and a prominent, spurred upper petal. This variety is shorter and more compact than the standard nasturtium, making it ideal for container gardening and small spaces. It is also known for its peppery taste, making it a popular edible plant in culinary and medicinal uses."
