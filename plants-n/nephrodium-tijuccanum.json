    "intro": "Nephrodium tijuccanum, commonly known as the Tijuca fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
