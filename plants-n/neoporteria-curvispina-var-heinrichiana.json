    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina var. heinrichiana, commonly known as the Heiligenstadt neoporteria, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are fragrant and white, often appearing in clusters, and are a key feature for identification. This variant is distinguished by its slightly curved spines on the stems, which give it its specific epithet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important plant."
