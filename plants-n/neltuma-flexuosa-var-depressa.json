    "intro": "Neltuma flexuosa var. depressa, commonly known as the lowland neltuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its potential use in horticultural settings."
