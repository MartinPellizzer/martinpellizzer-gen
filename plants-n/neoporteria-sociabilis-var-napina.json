It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
