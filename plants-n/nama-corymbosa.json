    "intro": "Nama corymbosa, commonly known as the sour plum or Natal plum, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to yellow or red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Nama corymbosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
