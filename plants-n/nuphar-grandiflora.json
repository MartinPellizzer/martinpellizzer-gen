    "intro": "Nuphar grandiflora, commonly known as the large yellow water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Nuphar grandiflora plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
