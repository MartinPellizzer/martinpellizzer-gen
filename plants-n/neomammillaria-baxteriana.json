It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or light-colored spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert landscapes."
