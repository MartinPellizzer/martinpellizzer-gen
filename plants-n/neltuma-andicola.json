    "intro": "Neltuma andicola, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Neltuma andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
