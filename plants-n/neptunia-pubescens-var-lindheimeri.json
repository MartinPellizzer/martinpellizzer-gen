It is characterized by its distinctive bladders, which are specialized structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite and often covered with fine, pubescent hairs, contributing to its common name. The species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling within aquatic ecosystems."
