    "intro": "Neomammillaria erythrosperma, commonly known as the red-seeded mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and produces vibrant red flowers during the spring. The plant has a compact, rounded stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its striking red flowers are often followed by showy, red or orange fruits. Neomammillaria erythrosperma is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
