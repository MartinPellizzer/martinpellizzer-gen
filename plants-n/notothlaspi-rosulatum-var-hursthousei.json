    "intro": "Notothlaspi rosulatum var. hursthousei, commonly known as the Hursthouse's rockcress, is a rare and distinctive member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oblanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It is native to specific alpine habitats in the British Isles, particularly in Scotland. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
