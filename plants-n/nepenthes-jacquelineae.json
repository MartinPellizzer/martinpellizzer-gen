    "intro": "Nepenthes jacquelineae, commonly known as the Jacqueline's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
