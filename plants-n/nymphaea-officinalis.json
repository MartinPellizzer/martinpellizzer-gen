    "intro": "Nymphaea officinalis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, and its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Nymphaea officinalis has been used in traditional medicine for centuries due to its purported healing properties."
