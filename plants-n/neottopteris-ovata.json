    "intro": "Neottopteris ovata, commonly known as the broad bucktooth fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, oblong segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Neottopteris ovata plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
