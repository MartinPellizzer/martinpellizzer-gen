    "intro": "Nidularium organense, commonly known as the Organ Mountains cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Organ Mountains in New Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
