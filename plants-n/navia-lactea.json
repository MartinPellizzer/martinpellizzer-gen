    "intro": "Navia lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a perennial herb native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its most distinctive feature is the milky sap, which exudes from the stems and leaves when damaged. Navia lactea plays an important ecological role, particularly in supporting the life cycle of monarch butterflies."
