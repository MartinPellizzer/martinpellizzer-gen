    "intro": "Narcissus romieuxii var. riffanus, commonly known as the Rif narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It produces elegant, single-stemmed flowers with white petals and a yellow-orange corona, blooming in early spring. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is highly valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
