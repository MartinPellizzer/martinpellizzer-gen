    "intro": "Notholaena krebsiana, commonly known as the Krebs' spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and upright, spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its structure includes a short, thick stem with whorled leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Notholaena krebsiana is often found in association with other mosses and liverworts in its natural habitat."
