    "intro": "Neea boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian neea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a glossy appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Neea boliviana is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, contributing to its unique ecological niche."
