    "intro": "Notodanthonia nivicola, commonly known as the snow-danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale-green spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
