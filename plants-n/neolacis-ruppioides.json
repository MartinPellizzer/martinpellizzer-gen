    "intro": "Neolacis ruppioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Neolacis ruppioides is often used in rock gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
