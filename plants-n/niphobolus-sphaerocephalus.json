    "intro": "Niphobolus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, with dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact structure. Its small, spherical capsules are borne on short, erect stalks, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Niphobolus sphaerocephalus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
