    "intro": "Neostenanthera platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, flat-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Neostenanthera platypetala is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
