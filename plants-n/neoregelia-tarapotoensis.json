    "intro": "Neoregelia tarapotoensis, commonly known as the Tarapoto skyplant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often strikingly shaped rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Neoregelia tarapotoensis is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
