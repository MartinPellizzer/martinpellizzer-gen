    "intro": "Nervilia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fern, is a striking member of the fern family. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
