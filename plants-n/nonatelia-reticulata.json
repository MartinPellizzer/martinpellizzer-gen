    "intro": "Nonatelia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features intricate, reticulate venation patterns that give it its common name. Its rhizomes are typically short and produce multiple fiddleheads, which unfurl into compound leaves. Nonatelia reticulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
