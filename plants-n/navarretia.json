    "intro": "Navarretia, commonly known as the fairy rings or beach evening primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the evening primrose family. These plants are native to western North America, particularly coastal regions, and are known for their delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. Navarretia species typically have basal leaves and produce flowers that range from white to yellow in color. They are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to coastal environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered rare or endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
