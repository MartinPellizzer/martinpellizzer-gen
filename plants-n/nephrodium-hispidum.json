    "intro": "Nephrodium hispidum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Nephrodium hispidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
