    "intro": "Nymphaea stellata spiralis, commonly known as the spiral water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped leaves that unfurl in a unique, helical pattern as they grow. The plant features showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while its stems float on the water. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in water gardens."
