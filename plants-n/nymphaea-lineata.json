    "intro": "Nymphaea lineata, commonly known as the ribbon lily or water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive white or pinkish coloration. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea lineata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
