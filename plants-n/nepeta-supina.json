    "intro": "Nepeta supina, commonly known as creeping catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic, with a mint-like scent, and are often used in herbal remedies. Nepeta supina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
