    "intro": "Nephelium mutabile var. trigynum, commonly known as the three-stigma rambutan, is a variant of the rambutan fruit native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny exterior and a fleshy, sweet pulp that encases a single seed. The plant is a small evergreen tree that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and warm temperatures. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and the fruit develops from these flowers after a several-month growth period. The three-stigma variant is notable for its unique floral structure, which sets it apart from the more common rambutan varieties."
