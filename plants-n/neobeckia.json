    "intro": "Neobeckia, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that resemble small cups. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials, often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Neobeckia species have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ease of growth."
