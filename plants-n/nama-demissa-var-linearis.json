It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
