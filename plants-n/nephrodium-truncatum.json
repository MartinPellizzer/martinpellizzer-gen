    "intro": "Nephrodium truncatum, commonly known as the rough kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
