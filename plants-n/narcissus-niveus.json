It is native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces white, cup-shaped flowers with a single prominent central stamen, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette near the ground. Narcissus niveus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
