It features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green with red or purple markings. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
