    "intro": "Nepenthes kurata, commonly known as the Kurata pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitcher traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down captured prey. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a glossy surface, and its pitchers can reach up to 20 centimeters in height. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-poor soil. Nepenthes kurata is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its striking appearance."
