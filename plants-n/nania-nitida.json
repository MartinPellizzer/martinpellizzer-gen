It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that is toxic to many animals. Nania nitida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
