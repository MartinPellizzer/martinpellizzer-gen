    "intro": "Neurophyllodes arborea, commonly known as the tree fern of the rainforest, is a unique plant characterized by its towering, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's ability to thrive in high humidity and low light conditions makes it an important component of rainforest ecosystems."
