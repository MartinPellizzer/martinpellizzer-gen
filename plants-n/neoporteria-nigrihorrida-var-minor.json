    "intro": "Neoporteria nigrihorrida var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf black-hairy neoporteria, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and its distinctive dark, hairy foliage. The leaves are usually dark green with a dense covering of fine, blackish hairs, giving it a striking appearance. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
