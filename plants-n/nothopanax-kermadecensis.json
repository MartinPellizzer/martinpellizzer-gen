    "intro": "Nothopanax kermadecensis, commonly known as the Kermadec pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal and moist forest habitats, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
