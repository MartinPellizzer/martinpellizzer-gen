    "intro": "Neooreophilus macroticus, commonly known as the giant mountain fern, is a rare and striking plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important subject for botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
