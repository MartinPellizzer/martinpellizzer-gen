    "intro": "Neillia sinensis var. hypomalaca, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with thick, fleshy roots that store water, aiding in its survival in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
