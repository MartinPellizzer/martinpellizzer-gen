    "intro": "Neomammillaria denudata, commonly known as the naked mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the central and southern regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive lack of spines, giving it a smooth, almost hairless appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Neomammillaria denudata is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
