    "intro": "Niphobolus angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Niphobolus angustatus is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey."
