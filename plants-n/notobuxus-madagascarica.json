    "intro": "Notobuxus madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar wax tree, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is compact, with a rounded form that makes it suitable for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
