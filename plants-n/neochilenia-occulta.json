    "intro": "Neochilenia occulta, commonly known as the hidden Chilean orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that are typically pale green or white with subtle markings. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, which is crucial for its survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
