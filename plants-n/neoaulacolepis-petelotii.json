    "intro": "Neoaulacolepis petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to Madagascar, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered."
