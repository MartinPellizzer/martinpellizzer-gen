    "intro": "Nephrodium nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its leaves are typically leathery and dark green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical regions. Nephrodium nidus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
