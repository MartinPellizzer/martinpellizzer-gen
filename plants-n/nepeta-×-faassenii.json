    "intro": "Nepeta \u00d7 faassenii, commonly known as catmint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square, hollow stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Catmint is known for its strong, minty fragrance, which is especially noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a natural deterrent for cats."
