    "intro": "Nigritella rubra f. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian red bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces violet-blue berries in the fall, which are a food source for various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
