    "intro": "Nemum angolense, commonly known as the Angola bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Angola. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
