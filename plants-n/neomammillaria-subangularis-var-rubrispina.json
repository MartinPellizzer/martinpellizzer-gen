    "intro": "Neomammillaria subangularis var. rubrispina, commonly known as the red-spined pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a ribbed stem with prominent, angular tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spines are typically reddish in color, which is a key identifying characteristic of this variety. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
