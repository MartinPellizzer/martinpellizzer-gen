    "intro": "Nasturtium turfosum, commonly known as the marsh nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in damp meadows. Its flowers are edible, with a peppery taste similar to watercress, and the leaves are also used in salads. Nasturtium turfosum plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
