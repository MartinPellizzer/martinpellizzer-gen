    "intro": "Neottia punctata, commonly known as the spotted helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial species that produces a single flower spike each year. Neottia punctata is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
