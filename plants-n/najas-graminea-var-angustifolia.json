    "intro": "Najas graminea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and young fish. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, affecting water flow and light penetration."
