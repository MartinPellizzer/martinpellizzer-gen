    "intro": "Nageia leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stamined nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Nageia leptostachya is a member of the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
