    "intro": "Nepenthes rhombicaulis, commonly known as the rhombic-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often reddish stems, which are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to lure and trap insects. These pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. Nepenthes rhombicaulis is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
