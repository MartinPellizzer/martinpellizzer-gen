    "intro": "Nepeta gienensis, commonly known as the Gienensian catnip, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their fragrant leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale blue to purple, blooming in summer. The plant is noted for its mild catnip-like scent, though it is less potent than traditional Nepeta cataria."
