It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along the coastal areas of Islay. It is known for its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, making it one of the largest species in its genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
