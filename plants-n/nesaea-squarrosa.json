    "intro": "Nesaea squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, and range in color from white to pale blue or pink. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal conditions."
