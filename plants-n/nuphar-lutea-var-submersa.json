    "intro": "Nuphar lutea var. submersa, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while its stems extend upward to support the leaves and flowers. The species is adapted to still or slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
