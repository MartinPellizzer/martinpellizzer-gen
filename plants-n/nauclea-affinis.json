    "intro": "Nauclea affinis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often thorny bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Nauclea affinis is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
