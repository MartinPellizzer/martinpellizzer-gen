    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata subsp. gigantea, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its leaves float on the surface. The giant water lily plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
