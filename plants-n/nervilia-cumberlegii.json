    "intro": "Nervilia cumberlegii, commonly known as the Cumberlegii fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only a fiddlehead and the second year bearing spore-bearing leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Nervilia cumberlegii is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
