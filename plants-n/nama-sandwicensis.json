    "intro": "Nama sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often found in well-drained soils. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and salt exposure. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
