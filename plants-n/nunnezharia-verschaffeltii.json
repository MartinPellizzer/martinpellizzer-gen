    "intro": "Nunnezharia verschaffeltii, commonly known as the Vanuatu star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers, which are typically pale yellow with contrasting dark purple or brown markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its delicate, fragrant blooms are short-lived but highly prized by botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
