    "intro": "Nauclea multicephala, commonly known as the African rosewood or yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. Nauclea multicephala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
