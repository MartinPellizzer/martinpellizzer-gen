    "intro": "Neoarytera collina, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, spherical clusters of small white to pink flowers, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a pincushion-like appearance. Neoarytera collina typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool and dry conditions. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
