    "intro": "Nymphaea violacea var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
