    "intro": "Nuphar tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water environments. Nuphar tenella plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
