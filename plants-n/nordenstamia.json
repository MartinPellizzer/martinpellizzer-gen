    "intro": "Nordenstamia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Nordenstamia is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
