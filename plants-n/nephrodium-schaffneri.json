    "intro": "Nephrodium schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and small, rounded lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
