    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy upper surface that repels water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
