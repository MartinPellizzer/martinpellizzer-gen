    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. froebelii, commonly known as the Froebel's white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a striking visual contrast to the white blooms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
