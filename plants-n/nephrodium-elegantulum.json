    "intro": "Nephrodium elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant nephrolepis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy structures along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.
