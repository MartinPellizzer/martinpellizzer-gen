    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas subsp. patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, lanceolate leaves that are typically divided into segments. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad outline that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
