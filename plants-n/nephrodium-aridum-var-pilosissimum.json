    "intro": "Nephrodium aridum var. pilosissimum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a unique plant species adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds. The plant exhibits a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, storing moisture for extended periods. This variant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures."
