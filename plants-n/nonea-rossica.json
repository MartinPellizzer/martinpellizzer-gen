    "intro": "Nonea rossica, commonly known as the Rossica lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh environments, such as polar regions and high-altitude areas, where it forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant's morphology is characterized by its thin, flat thallus that lacks distinct leaves or stems. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in extreme ecosystems. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions."
