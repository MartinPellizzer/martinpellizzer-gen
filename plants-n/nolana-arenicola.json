It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland desert environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Nolana arenicola plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various desert organisms."
