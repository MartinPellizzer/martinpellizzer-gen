    "intro": "Nitraria schoberi, commonly known as the desert raisin, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, red or yellow fruits that resemble raisins, which are edible and have a sweet, sour flavor. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in extreme climates. Nitraria schoberi plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
