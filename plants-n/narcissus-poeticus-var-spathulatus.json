    "intro": "Narcissus poeticus var. spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive, often recurved, tepal structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often broader than those of other narcissus varieties. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in early spring. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
