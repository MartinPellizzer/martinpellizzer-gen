It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble small globes, which are composed of tightly packed, blue to purple bracts. The plant has a compact growth habit with silver-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced during the winter months. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neuracanthus sphaerostachyus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
