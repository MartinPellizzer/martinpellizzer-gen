    "intro": "Nunnezharia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible nunnezharia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, often prostrate stems that exhibit a flexible growth habit, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Nunnezharia flexuosa is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
