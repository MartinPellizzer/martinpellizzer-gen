    "intro": "Nymphoides spinulosperma, commonly known as the spinylug or hairy water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic ecosystems. Nymphoides spinulosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients."
