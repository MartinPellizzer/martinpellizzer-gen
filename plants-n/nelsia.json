    "intro": "Nelsia, commonly known as the \"dove tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescences, which resemble small white blossoms clustered around a central stem, giving it a dove-like appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface. Nelsia species are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and are often grown as houseplants or in shaded garden settings."
