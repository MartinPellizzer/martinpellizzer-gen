    "intro": "Nothotsuga longibracteata subsp. fanjingshenensis, commonly known as Fanjing fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Fanjing Mountain region in China. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many fir species. The plant exhibits distinct morphological features, including elongated bracts and a unique reproductive structure. It thrives in high-altitude, cool, and moist environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
