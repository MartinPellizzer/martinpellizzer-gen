    "intro": "Neurolaena lamina, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Neurolaena lamina is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
