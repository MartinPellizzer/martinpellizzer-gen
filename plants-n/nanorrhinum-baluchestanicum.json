    "intro": "Nanorrhinum baluchestanicum, commonly known as the Balochistan thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems. However, it is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to invade disturbed soils."
