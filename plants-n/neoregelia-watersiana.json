    "intro": "Neoregelia watersiana, commonly known as the Water's Necklace, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant forms a tight, water-holding cup at its base, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, red, and orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Neoregelia watersiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
