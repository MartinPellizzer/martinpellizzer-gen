    "intro": "Neillia fallax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Neillia fallax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
