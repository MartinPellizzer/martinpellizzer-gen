    "intro": "Niphobolus rupestris, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and dry soils, exhibiting a compact rosette of broad, velvety leaves. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are characterized by their thick, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Niphobolus rupestris is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
