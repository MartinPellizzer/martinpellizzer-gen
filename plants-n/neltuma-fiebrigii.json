    "intro": "Neltuma fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiery Neltuma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma fiebrigii is considered a vulnerable species."
