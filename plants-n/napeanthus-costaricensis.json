    "intro": "Napeanthus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican napeanthus, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Napeanthus costaricensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Its conservation status remains relatively stable, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its population."
