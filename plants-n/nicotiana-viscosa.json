The plant produces small, violet or blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Nicotiana viscosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
