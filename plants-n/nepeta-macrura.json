    "intro": "Nepeta macrura, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage emits a strong mint-like aroma, which is particularly noticeable when crushed. Nepeta macrura is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
