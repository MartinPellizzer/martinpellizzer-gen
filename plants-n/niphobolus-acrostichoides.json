    "intro": "Niphobolus acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. The botanical features of Niphobolus acrostichoides make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
