    "intro": "Neanotis urophylla, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Neanotis urophylla is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation."
