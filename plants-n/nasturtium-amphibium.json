    "intro": "Nasturtium amphibium, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant that thrives in moist environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in aquatic or semi-aquatic soils. Nasturtium amphibium is known for its peppery taste and is often used in salads or as a garnish."
