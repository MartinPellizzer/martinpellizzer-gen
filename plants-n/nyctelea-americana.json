    "intro": "Nyctelea americana, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough texture, and its flowers emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution."
