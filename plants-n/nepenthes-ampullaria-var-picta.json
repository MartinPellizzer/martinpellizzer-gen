    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullaria var. picta, commonly known as the picta variant of the ampullaria nepenthes, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, colorful pitchers that range from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its modified leaves, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. Its pitchers are typically shorter and wider compared to other Nepenthes species, adapted for capturing larger prey. This variant is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy cultivation requirements."
