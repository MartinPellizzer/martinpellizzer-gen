    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snow narcissus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It produces small, white flowers with a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bulbs are small and rounded, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive harsh winter conditions. This subspecies is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters."
