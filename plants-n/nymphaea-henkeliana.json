    "intro": "Nymphaea henkeliana, commonly known as the Henkel's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically round with a waxy surface, and its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Nymphaea henkeliana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
