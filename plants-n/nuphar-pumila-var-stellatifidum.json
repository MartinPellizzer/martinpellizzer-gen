    "intro": "Nuphar pumila var. stellatifidum, commonly known as the starry swamp waterplantain, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters in North America. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves with a waxy surface and produces showy yellow flowers with a distinct star-like pattern. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it thrives in shallow water with adequate sunlight. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality."
