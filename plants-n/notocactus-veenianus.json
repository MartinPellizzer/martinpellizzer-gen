    "intro": "Notocactus veenianus, commonly known as the Veenia notocactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, bluish-green skin. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
