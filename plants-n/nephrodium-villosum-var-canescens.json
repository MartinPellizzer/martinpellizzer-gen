    "intro": "Nephrodium villosum var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of green and brown. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it is often found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. The varietal form canescens is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical variety."
