    "intro": "Neosepicaea jucunda, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Neosepicaea jucunda is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in the ecological systems of its native forests."
