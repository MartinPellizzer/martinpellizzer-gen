    "intro": "Nemastylis acuta, commonly known as the sharp-nosed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or near streams. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
