It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true water ferns. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Neocheiropteris henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
