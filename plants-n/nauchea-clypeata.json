    "intro": "Nauchea clypeata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Nauchhea clypeata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
