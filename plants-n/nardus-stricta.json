    "intro": "Nardus stricta, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively."
