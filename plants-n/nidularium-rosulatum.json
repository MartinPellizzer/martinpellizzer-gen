    "intro": "Nidularium rosulatum, commonly known as the Rosulate Nidularium, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and they often bear intricate patterns of veins. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, usually in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
