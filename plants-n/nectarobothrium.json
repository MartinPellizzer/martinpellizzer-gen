    "intro": "Nectarobothrium, commonly known as the nectar-feeding fly, is a genus of flies that belongs to the family Dolichopodidae. These small insects are often found in open habitats where they can access nectar from flowers. They have short, stout bodies and are typically metallic in color, which helps them blend with their surroundings. Nectarobothrium species are important pollinators, contributing to the reproduction of various flowering plants. Their feeding habits and ecological roles make them significant in both ecological and botanical studies."
