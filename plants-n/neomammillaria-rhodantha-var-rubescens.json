    "intro": "Neomammillaria rhodantha var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles, which are adorned with bright red or pink spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
