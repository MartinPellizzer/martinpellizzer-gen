    "intro": "Nymphaea pygmaea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the dwarf water lily with large flowers, is a variant of the water lily native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in the substrate while its stems and leaves remain above water. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
