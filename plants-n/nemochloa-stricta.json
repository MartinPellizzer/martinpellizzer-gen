It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils. It is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. Due to its adaptability, it can be a common sight in wetland habitats across its native range."
