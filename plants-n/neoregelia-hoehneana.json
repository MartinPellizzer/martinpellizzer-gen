    "intro": "Neoregelia hoehneana, commonly known as the Hoehneana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces an inflorescence with striking orange-red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments with indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to tropical plant collections."
