    "intro": "Nephrodium patens var. stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, leaf-like stipules along the leaf stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
