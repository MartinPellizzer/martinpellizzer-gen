    "intro": "Notholaena angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Notholaena angusta is a relatively small fern, with a compact growth habit that makes it well-suited to its specific ecological niche."
