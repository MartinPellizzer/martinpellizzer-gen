    "intro": "Neottia strateumatica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
