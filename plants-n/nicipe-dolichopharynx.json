    "intro": "Nicipe dolichopharynx, commonly known as the long-throat orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stem and striking, pale purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to temperature changes. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in the local ecosystem as a pollinator attractant."
