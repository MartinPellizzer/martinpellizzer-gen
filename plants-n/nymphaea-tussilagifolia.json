It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its flowers bloom in shades of white, pink, or yellow. Nymphaea tussilagifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
