    "intro": "Nepa vaillantii, commonly known as the water lily of Madagascar, is a striking aquatic plant native to the island nation. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its broad, glossy leaves float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Nepa vaillantii is notable for its unique ability to trap air bubbles within its leaves, aiding in buoyancy and gas exchange."
