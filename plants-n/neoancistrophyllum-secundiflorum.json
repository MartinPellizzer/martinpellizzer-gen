It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in a distinctive pattern. The plant exhibits a climbing growth habit, often utilizing support structures in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a woody stem with a smooth, slightly pubescent surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
