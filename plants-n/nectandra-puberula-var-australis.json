    "intro": "Nectandra puberula var. australis, commonly known as the Australian satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
