    "intro": "Neoregelia olens, commonly known as the Emerald Gem, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant green, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a dense central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic contrast to its foliage. Neoregelia olens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
