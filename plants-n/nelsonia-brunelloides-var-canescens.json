It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps to reduce water loss in its native environment. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
