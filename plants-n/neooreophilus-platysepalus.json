    "intro": "Neooreophilus platysepalus, commonly known as the flat-sepal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flattened sepals that give it its scientific name, and its small, intricate flowers that often feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Its blooming period is seasonal, usually occurring during the wet season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
