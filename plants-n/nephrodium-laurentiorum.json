    "intro": "Nephrodium laurentiorum, commonly known as the Laurentian kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
