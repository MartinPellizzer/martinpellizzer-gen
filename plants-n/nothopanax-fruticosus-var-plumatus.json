    "intro": "Nothopanax fruticosus var. plumatus, commonly known as the plum-leafed nothopanax, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that are often tinged with a distinctive plum-colored hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by clusters of small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
