    "intro": "Nageia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nageia, is a species of conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the shoots. The plant produces cones that are small and cylindrical, with male and female cones occurring on separate trees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Nageia angustifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
