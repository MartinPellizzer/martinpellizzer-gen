    "intro": "Notocactus ottonis var. janousekianus, commonly known as the Janousek's notocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the rainy season, which are typically borne at the stem tips. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
