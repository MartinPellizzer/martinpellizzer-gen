    "intro": "Nestlera muriculata, commonly known as the roughleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Nestlera muriculata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
