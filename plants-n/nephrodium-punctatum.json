The leaves are often marked with dark, irregular spots, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Its structure supports a variety of aquatic life, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
