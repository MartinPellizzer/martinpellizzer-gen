    "intro": "Nymphoides indica, commonly known as the Indian water plant or water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in still water bodies. Nymphoides indica is often used in ornamental water gardens and has traditional uses in some cultures for its medicinal properties."
