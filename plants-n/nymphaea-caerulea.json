    "intro": "Nymphaea caerulea, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa. It features showy, floating flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a white center, and are fully submerged at night. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea caerulea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
