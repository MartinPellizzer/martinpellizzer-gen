    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-femina, commonly known as the female fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dark brown, wiry roots, and its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Nephrodium filix-femina produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
