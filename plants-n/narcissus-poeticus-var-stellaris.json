It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, elongated flower stem. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
