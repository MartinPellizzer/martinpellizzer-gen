    "intro": "Nunnezharia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf nunnezharia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact stature, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nunnezharia microphylla is considered a species of conservation concern."
