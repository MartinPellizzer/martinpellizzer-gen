    "intro": "Nuxia congesta var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved nuxia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The variety brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Nuxia congesta."
