    "intro": "Nicotiana acuminata var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a compact, herbaceous species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for container gardening and ornamental use. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its nicotine content. This variety is also valued for its use in ecological studies due to its role as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species."
