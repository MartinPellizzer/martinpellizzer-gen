    "intro": "Nephelium, commonly known as rambutan, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny exterior that resembles a cloud, hence its name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit develops in clusters and matures to a bright red or yellow color. Nephelium thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
