    "intro": "Nymphoides cristata, commonly known as the crested water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its roots are anchored in the water, and it spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Nymphoides cristata is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
