    "intro": "Nasturtium integrifolium, commonly known as the common nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of orange and yellow. The plant is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. Its flowers are edible and often used in salads or as a garnish, while the leaves can be consumed as well, though they have a peppery taste. Nasturtium integrifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its use in companion planting to deter pests."
