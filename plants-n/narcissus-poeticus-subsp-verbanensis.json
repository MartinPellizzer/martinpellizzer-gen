    "intro": "Narcissus poeticus subsp. verbanensis, commonly known as the Verbanian daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive white or greenish throat, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features strap-shaped leaves and grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
