    "intro": "Neophloga linearis, commonly known as the slender flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Neophloga linearis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
