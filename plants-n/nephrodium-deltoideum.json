    "intro": "Nephrodium deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid nephroid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with a deltoid shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. Nephrodium deltoideum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
