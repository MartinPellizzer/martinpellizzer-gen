    "intro": "Najas major var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in shallow, vegetated zones. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth can also lead to dense vegetation, impacting water flow and light penetration."
