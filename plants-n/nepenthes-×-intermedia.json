    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes ventrata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its large, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its growth habit involves climbing and can reach lengths of several meters, making it a striking feature in its native habitat. The plant's unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture."
