    "intro": "Narcissus asturiensis subsp. vasconicus, commonly known as the Vasconic daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Pyrenees region of Spain. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white throat, typically blooming in early spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and a short stem that supports its single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
