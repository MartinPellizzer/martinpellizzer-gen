    "intro": "Nicolletia edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' Nicolletia, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the prairie and woodland habitats of the Midwest. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a showy inflorescence with yellow to orange petals. Nicolletia edwardsii blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting local ecosystems make it an important species in native plant gardens."
