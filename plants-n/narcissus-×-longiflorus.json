    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 longiflorus, commonly known as the giant daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus poeticus and Narcissus tazetta. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a prominent, often trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with strap-like leaves that are broad and dark green. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, supporting the plant's rapid growth and flowering. The flowers bloom in spring, producing a vibrant yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
