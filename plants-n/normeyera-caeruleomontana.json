    "intro": "Normeyera caeruleomontana, commonly known as the blue mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
