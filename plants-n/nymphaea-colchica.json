    "intro": "Nymphaea colchica, commonly known as the Colchic water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Lake Sevan region in Armenia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive cup-like structure. Nymphaea colchica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
