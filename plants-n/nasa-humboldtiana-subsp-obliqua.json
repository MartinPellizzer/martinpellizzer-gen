    "intro": "Nasa humboldtiana subsp. obliqua, commonly known as the Humboldt's nasa, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure and dark green, waxy leaves that are adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
