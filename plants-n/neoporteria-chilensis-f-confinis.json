    "intro": "Neoporteria chilensis f. confinis, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a rare fern endemic to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along the coastline, where it is exposed to salt-laden winds. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
