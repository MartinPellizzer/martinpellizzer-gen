    "intro": "Nephrodium pseudomontanum, commonly known as the false mountain nephrolepis, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, and its fronds are arranged in a compact rosette. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
