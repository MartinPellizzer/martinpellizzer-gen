    "intro": "Nephrodium stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It has long, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinct, fan-like arrangement. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched rhizomes and its ability to thrive in slow-moving or still water. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in wet environments. Nephrodium stenopteris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
