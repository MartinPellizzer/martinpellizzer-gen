    "intro": "Nephrodium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Nephrodium flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
