    "intro": "Neottia tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale green flower with a distinctive lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
