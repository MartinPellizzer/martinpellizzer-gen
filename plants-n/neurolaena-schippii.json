    "intro": "Neurolaena schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. Neurolaena schippii is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
