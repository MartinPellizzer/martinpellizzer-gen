    "intro": "Neottia unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, photosynthetic structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in a spike, and are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Neottia unguiculata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain invertebrates."
