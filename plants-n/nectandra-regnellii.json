    "intro": "Nectandra regnellii, commonly known as the yellow sand-wood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown wood and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
