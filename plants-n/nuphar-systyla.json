    "intro": "Nuphar systyla, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, where they absorb nutrients. Nuphar systyla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water quality."
