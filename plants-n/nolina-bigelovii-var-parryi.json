    "intro": "Nolina bigelovii var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
