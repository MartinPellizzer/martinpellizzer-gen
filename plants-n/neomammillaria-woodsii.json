    "intro": "Neomammillaria woodsii, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Neomammillaria woodsii is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
