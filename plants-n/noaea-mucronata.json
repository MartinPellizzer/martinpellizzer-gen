It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Noaea mucronata is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its ecological role includes providing food for various insects and serving as a stabilizer for sandy soils."
