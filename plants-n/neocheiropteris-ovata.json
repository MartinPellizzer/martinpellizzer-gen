    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ovata, commonly known as the ovate shield fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Marattiales. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically preserved as compressions in ancient sedimentary rocks. The plant exhibits a complex venation pattern, which provides insights into the evolutionary development of ferns. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are often found on the underside of the fronds. Neocheiropteris ovata thrived during the Late Paleozoic era, contributing to the dense vegetation of ancient forests."
