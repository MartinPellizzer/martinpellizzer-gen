    "intro": "Notochaete, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Notochaete species are perennial herbs that produce small, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and their role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
