    "intro": "Narketis carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carinthian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. Narketis carinthiaca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
