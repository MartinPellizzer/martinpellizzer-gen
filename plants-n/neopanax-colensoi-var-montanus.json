    "intro": "Neopanax colensoi var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain neopanax, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and ecological preservation."
