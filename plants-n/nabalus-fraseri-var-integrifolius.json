    "intro": "Nabalus fraseri var. integrifolius, commonly known as the Fraser's navelwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically entire, giving it the species name *integrifolius*. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
