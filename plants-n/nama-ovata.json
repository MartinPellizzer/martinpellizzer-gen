It features thick, fleshy leaves that are oval in shape, designed to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Nama ovata is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
