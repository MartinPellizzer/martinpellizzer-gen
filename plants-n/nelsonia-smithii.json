    "intro": "Nelsonia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's Nelsonia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid conditions. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, often appearing in spring, and it produces distinctive, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nelsonia smithii is considered a vulnerable species."
