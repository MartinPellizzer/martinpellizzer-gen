    "intro": "Nematanthus ecklonii, commonly known as the Easter lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features trailing stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nematanthus ecklonii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
