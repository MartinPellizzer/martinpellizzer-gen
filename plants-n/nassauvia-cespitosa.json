    "intro": "Nassauvia cespitosa, commonly known as creeping nassauvia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, branching stems that root at the nodes, forming a mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
