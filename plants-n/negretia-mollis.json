    "intro": "Negretia mollis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, which is common among orchids. Negretia mollis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
