    "intro": "Nymphaea caerulea var. eigii, commonly known as the Blue Water Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or aquatic environments. Nymphaea caerulea var. eigii is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
