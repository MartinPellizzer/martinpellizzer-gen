    "intro": "Nephrodium polymorphum, commonly known as the variable nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a wide variation in leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are typically arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Nephrodium polymorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
