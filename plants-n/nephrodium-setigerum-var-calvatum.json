    "intro": "Nephrodium setigerum var. calvatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the nephrodium genus characterized by its lack of fronds. It is a herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in small clusters on the undersides of the leaves. This variant is notable for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in ecological succession in forest understories."
