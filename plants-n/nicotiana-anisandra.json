    "intro": "Nicotiana anisandra, commonly known as the aniseleaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its aromatic, anise-scented leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. The leaves contain nicotine and other alkaloids, making it a relative of the tobacco plant."
