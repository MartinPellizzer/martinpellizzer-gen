    "intro": "Neogleasonia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have shrub-like growth forms with small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Neogleasonia species are characterized by their robust root systems and ability to withstand drought conditions. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
