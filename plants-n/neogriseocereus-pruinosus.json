    "intro": "Neogriseocereus pruinosus, commonly known as the silky night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its columnar stem covered in a dense, white, waxy coating that gives it a silky appearance. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. The species is well-suited to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
