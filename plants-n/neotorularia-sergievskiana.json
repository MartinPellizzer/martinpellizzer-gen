    "intro": "Neotorularia sergievskiana, commonly known as the Siberian lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in cold, arid environments. It is characterized by its dark, often blackish thallus that forms a thin, crust-like layer on rock surfaces. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal component and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found in high-altitude regions and boreal forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions."
