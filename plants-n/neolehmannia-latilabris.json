It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
