    "intro": "Niedenzuella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent petals. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it a myco-heterotroph, dependent on fungi for sustenance. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, often blooming in clusters. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Niedenzuella is considered endangered in many areas."
