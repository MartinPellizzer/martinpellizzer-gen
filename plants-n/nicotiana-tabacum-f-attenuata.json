It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants such as tomatoes and peppers. This plant is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm, sunny climates. It produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. The plant is notable for its role in ecological studies due to its interactions with specific herbivores and its genetic diversity."
