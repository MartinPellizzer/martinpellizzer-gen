    "intro": "Neomammillaria goodridgei, commonly known as the Goodridge's nipple cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent areoles and short, white to yellowish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
