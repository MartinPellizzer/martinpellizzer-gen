    "intro": "Narcissus croceocinctus, commonly known as the yellow band narcissus, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a distinctive orange-yellow band near the base. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine and woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
