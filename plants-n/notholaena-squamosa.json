    "intro": "Notholaena squamosa, commonly known as the scaly field sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Notholaena squamosa typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help in spreading and stabilizing the soil."
