    "intro": "Neurocallis rivularis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Neurocallis, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Nychthemeraliaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has showy, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, hence its common name. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Neurocallis rivularis plays an important role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and offering shelter to aquatic life."
