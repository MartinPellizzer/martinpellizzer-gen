    "intro": "Nepenthes jardinei, commonly known as the Jardine's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's pitcher-shaped structures are filled with a digestive fluid that attracts and breaks down prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. Its striking red and green coloration makes it a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts."
