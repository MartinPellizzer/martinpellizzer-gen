    "intro": "Neolaugeria densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered neolaugeria, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces woody fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
