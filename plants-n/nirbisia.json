    "intro": "Nirbisia, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Nirbisia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
