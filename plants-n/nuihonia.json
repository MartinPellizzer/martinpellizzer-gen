    "intro": "Nuihonia, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Nuihonia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
