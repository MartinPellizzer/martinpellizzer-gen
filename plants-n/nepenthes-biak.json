    "intro": "Nepenthes biak, commonly known as the Biak pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the island of Biak in Indonesia. It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves, which are modified to function as pitfall traps for capturing insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and produce a sweet-smelling nectar to attract prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating that prevents captured insects from escaping. Nepenthes biak is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the local ecosystem by recycling nutrients through its carnivorous behavior."
