    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. normalis, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a popular evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features feathery, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in outdoor settings."
