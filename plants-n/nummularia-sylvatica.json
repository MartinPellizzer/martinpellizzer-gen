    "intro": "Nummularia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest pennywort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a glossy green, sometimes with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
