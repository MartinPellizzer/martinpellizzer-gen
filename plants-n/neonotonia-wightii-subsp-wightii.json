    "intro": "Neonotonia wightii subsp. wightii, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and highly valued tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. It has a slow growth rate and is known for its unique, aromatic scent. Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
