    "intro": "Nymphoides grayana, commonly known as the Chinese water lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Nymphoides grayana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
