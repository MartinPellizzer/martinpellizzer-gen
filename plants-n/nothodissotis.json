    "intro": "Nothodissotis, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they produce wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures. Nothodissotis species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions. They are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological roles in supporting pollinators."
