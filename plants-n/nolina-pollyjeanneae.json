    "intro": "Nolina pollyjeanneae, commonly known as the Pollyjeanne nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the arid regions of western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical rosette of leathery, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
