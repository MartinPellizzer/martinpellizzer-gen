    "intro": "Notodanthonia linkii, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Notodanthonia linkii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native gardens for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
