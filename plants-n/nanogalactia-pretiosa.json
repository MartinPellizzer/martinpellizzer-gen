    "intro": "Nanogalactia pretiosa, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and often covered in small thorns, which provide some protection against herbivores. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, sandy soils."
