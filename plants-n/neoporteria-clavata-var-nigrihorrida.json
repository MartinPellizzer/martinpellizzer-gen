    "intro": "Neoporteria clavata var. nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-hairy neoporteria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hairy, glandular stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
