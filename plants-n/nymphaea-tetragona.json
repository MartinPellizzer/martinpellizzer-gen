    "intro": "Nymphaea tetragona, commonly known as the white lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close at midday. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Nymphaea tetragona plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems and is also valued for its cultural and medicinal significance."
