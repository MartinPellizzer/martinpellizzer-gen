    "intro": "Nicotiana stocktonii, commonly known as Stockton's tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in regions with high elevations. It produces small, oval-shaped berries that contain the seeds, and it is known for its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
