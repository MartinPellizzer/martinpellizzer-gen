    "intro": "Nassella elata, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Nassella elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
