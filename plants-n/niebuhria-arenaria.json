    "intro": "Niebuhria arenaria, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Niebuhria arenaria plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in open, disturbed areas."
