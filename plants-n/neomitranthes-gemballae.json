It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Neomitranthes gemballae is known for its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
