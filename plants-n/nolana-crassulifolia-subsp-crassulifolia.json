    "intro": "Nolana crassulifolia subsp. crassulifolia, commonly known as the woolly nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
