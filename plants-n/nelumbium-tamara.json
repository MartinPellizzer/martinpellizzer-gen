    "intro": "Nelumbium tamara, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Tibet, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from the water's surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps repel water and support its buoyant growth. Its flowers are known to open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior that may aid in pollination by attracting early morning pollinators. Nelumbium tamara holds cultural and spiritual significance in Tibetan Buddhism, often symbolizing purity and enlightenment."
