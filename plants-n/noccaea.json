    "intro": "Noccaea, commonly known as the water spinach or Indian spinach, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate or opposite, with smooth or hairy surfaces. They produce small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and their fruits are dry pods containing several seeds. Noccaea species are often found in moist, disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
