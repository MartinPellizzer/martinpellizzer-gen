    "intro": "Nolana arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa nolana, is a flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of southern Peru. It is characterized by its small, woolly leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. Its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and moths. Nolana arequipensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
