    "intro": "Nototriche chimborazoensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo nototriche, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it adapts to the harsh climate with thick, waxy leaves. Its growth pattern is low and mat-forming, allowing it to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region."
