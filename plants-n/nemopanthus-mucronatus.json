    "intro": "Nemopanthus mucronatus, commonly known as the spoonwood or spoon-leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
