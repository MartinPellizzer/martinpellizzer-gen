    "intro": "Nymphaea maculata, commonly known as the Spotted Water Lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with a distinctive white or pinkish bloom, often marked with dark spots. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea maculata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
