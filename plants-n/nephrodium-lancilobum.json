    "intro": "Nephrodium lancilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The fronds are usually divided into several pairs of lobes, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
