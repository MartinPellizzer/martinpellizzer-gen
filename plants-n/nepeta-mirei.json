    "intro": "Nepeta mirei, commonly known as the alpine catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces whorled leaves that are often hairy and have a mint-like aroma. Nepeta mirei thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
