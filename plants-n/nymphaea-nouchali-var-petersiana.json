    "intro": "Nymphaea nouchali var. petersiana, commonly known as the white water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. The plant produces striking white flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates. Nymphaea nouchali var. petersiana is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
