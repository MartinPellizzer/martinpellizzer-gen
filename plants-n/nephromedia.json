    "intro": "Nephromedia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Nephromedia is often found in wetland areas and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
