It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Neobathiea filicornu is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
