    "intro": "Nesogordonia suzannae, commonly known as the Suzanna's African mahogany, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its straight, dark brown trunk and smooth, glossy bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its dense, durable wood, which has led to significant deforestation and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from further decline."
