    "intro": "Nephrodium lustratum, commonly known as the shining kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, which are arranged in a pinnate pattern. Nephrodium lustratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
