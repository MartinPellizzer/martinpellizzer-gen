    "intro": "Neomirandea standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Due to its restricted habitat and habitat degradation, Neomirandea standleyi is considered critically endangered."
