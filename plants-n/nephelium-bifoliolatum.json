It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit with a hairy exterior. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into the fleshy, edible fruits. Its leaves are alternate and often have two small lobes at the base, giving it its scientific name.
