    "intro": "Nigritella runei, commonly known as the Runei's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense, fibrous network that helps it anchor in the moist, shaded understory of its habitat. Nigritella runei is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, relying on its host for physical support. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
