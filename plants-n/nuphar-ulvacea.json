    "intro": "Nuphar ulvacea, commonly known as the water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Nuphar ulvacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
