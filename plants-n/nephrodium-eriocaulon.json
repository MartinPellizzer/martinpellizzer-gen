    "intro": "Nephrodium eriocaulon, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its leaves are small and often reduced, with the primary photosynthetic structures being the bladder-like bladders. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
