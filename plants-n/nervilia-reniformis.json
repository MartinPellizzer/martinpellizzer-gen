    "intro": "Nervilia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soils. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Nervilia reniformis is an herbaceous perennial that is relatively rare and often found in specific microhabitats."
