It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
