    "intro": "Neohumbertiella decaryi var. fiherenensis, commonly known as the Fiherenense Neohumbertiella, is a rare and unique plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and are arranged in a dense, compact formation. This variant is notable for its specific ecological niche, often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of the Santalaceae family in Madagascar."
