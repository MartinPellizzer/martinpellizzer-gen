    "intro": "Nephrolepis undulata, commonly known as the curly-leaf fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green, with a waxy surface and a distinctive undulating or wavy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
