    "intro": "Neostapfiella chloridiantha, commonly known as the green-stemmed cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spore-bearing female cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Neostapfiella chloridiantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
