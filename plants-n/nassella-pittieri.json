    "intro": "Nassella pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, spikelike inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Nassella pittieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
