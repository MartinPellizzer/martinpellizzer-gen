    "intro": "Nicotia, commonly known as tobacco plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, green berries that contain the seeds, which are used in the cultivation of tobacco. Nicotia is known for containing nicotine, a potent alkaloid that has both medicinal and recreational uses. However, it is also considered a noxious weed in many regions due to its invasive nature and toxic properties."
