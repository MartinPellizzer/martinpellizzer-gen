    "intro": "Neltuma juliflora, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Neltuma juliflora is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
