    "intro": "Nidorella aberdarica, commonly known as the Aberdare rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Aberdare Range of Kenya. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and typically produces a single flower per stem. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidorella aberdarica is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
