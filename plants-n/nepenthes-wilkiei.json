    "intro": "Nepenthes wilkiei, commonly known as Wilkie's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color, with a waxy rim that helps prevent prey from escaping. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. This species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
