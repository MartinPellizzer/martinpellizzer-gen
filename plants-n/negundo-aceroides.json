It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various climates. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments make it a popular choice for landscaping."
