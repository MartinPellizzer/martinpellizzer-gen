    "intro": "Notocactus villa-velhensis var. carambeiensis, commonly known as the Carambeiensis Notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its columnar stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued by botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
