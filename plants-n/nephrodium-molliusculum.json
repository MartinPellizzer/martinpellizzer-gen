    "intro": "Nephrodium molliusculum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its soft, moss-like appearance. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetland environments. The plant's structure consists of a central stem with dense, velvety clusters of tiny, overlapping leaves. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Nephrodium molliusculum plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic microorganisms."
