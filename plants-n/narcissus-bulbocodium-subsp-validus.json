    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. validus, commonly known as the Validus narcissus, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, white flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant grows from a bulb and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
