It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
