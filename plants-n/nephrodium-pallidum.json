    "intro": "Nephrodium pallidum, commonly known as the pale nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The pale nephrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
