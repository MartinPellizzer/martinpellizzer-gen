    "intro": "Nitrosalsola baryosma, commonly known as the desert thorn or false date palm, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in spines for defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Nitrosalsola baryosma is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
