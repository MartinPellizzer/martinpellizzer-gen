    "intro": "Nasturtiolum montanum, commonly known as the mountain watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, edible leaves that are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountain streams and rocky habitats. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
