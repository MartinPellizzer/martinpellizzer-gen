It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Niphogeton pusilla plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
