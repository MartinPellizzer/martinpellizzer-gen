    "intro": "Neonauclea bomberaiensis, commonly known as the Bomberai ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, red drupes. Neonauclea bomberaiensis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional construction and carving. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
