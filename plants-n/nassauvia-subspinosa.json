It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with small spines along the edges, contributing to its rugged appearance. Nassauvia subspinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
