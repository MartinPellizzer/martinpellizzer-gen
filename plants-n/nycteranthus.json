These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that open in the evening and close during the day. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Nycteranthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to climb using tendrils."
