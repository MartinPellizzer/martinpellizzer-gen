It features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some local cuisines."
