    "intro": "Nothosmyrnium xizangense var. xizangense, commonly known as the Xizang myrtle, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Yunnan province of China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
