    "intro": "Neocinnamomum delavayi var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered cinnamon tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yunnan province of China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by egg-shaped, reddish-brown berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
