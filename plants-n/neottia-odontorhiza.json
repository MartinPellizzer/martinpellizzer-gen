    "intro": "Neottia odontorhiza, commonly known as the tooth-root orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a distinctive root system with a thick, tooth-like structure at the base, which is a key feature in its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia odontorhiza is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological relationship with fungi."
