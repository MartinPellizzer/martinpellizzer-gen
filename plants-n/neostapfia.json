    "intro": "Neostapfia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Neostapfia species are characterized by their striking, fern-like leaves that often have a silvery or metallic sheen. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often thriving in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a spathe and spadix structure typical of the Araceae family."
