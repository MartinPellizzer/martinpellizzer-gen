It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among members of its family. Neotanahashia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
