    "intro": "Najas major var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are borne in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft substrates, often forming dense vegetation that provides habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in some regions."
