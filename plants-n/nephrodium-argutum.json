    "intro": "Nephrodium argutum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium argutum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, moist soil."
