    "intro": "Neottia brevicaulis, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a single, short raceme of small, greenish-yellow flowers that lack petals and sepals. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Neottia brevicaulis is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption."
