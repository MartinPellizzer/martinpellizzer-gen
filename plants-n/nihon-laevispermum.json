    "intro": "Nihon laevispermum, commonly known as the Japanese smooth-seed vine, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its smooth, hairless seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. Nihon laevispermum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks."
