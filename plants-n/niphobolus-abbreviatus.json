It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in moist, open habitats. Niphobolus abbreviatus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
