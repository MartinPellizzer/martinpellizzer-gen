    "intro": "Napeanthus rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Napeanthus rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a cut flower."
