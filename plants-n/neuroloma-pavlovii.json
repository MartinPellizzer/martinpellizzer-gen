    "intro": "Neuroloma pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few racemes of flowers, each with a distinctive, hooded shape. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
