    "intro": "Neoporteria totoralensis, commonly known as the Totoralensis milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Neoporteria totoralensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species."
