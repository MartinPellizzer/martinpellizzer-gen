    "intro": "Nephrodium nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada kidney fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Nevada. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium nevadense is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
