    "intro": "Neurolepis diversiglumis, commonly known as the broad-leaved neurolepis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. Neurolepis diversiglumis is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
