    "intro": "Neomitranthes regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Neomitranthes regeliana is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
