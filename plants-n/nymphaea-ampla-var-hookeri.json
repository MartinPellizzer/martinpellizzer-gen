    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive yellow center, blooming during the day and closing at night. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
