It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedging and topiary in landscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
