    "intro": "Neonelsonia ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Neonelsonia ovata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
