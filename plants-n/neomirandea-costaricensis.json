It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they emit a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Neomirandea costaricensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
