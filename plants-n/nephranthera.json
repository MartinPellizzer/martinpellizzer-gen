    "intro": "Nephranthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a type of orchid that typically grows on trees or in the canopy, relying on specific host plants for support. The plant has thin, pale green leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink. Nephranthera is known for its unique appearance and is considered a symbol of the rainforest's biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, it is also a threatened species."
