    "intro": "Noccaea occitanica subsp. tallonis, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streams and in mountainous areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
