    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus lata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a aquatic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade on the water surface, while its showy, fragrant flowers open during the day. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water, allowing it to thrive in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, and its flowers come in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Nymphaea lotus lata plays an important ecological role by supporting aquatic life and improving water quality."
