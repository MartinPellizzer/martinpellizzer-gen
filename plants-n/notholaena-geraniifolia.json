It features delicate, lobed leaves that resemble those of geraniums, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage provides ornamental value, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
