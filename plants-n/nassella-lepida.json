    "intro": "Nassella lepida, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Nassella lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
