    "intro": "Notocactus uebelmannianus subsp. pleiocephalus, commonly known as the Uebelmann's notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the late winter to early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
