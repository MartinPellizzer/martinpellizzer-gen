    "intro": "Neomammillaria wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to reddish in color, often adorned with white or pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
