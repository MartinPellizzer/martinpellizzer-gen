    "intro": "Nuxia subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved nuxia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Nuxia subcoriacea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
