    "intro": "Nephrodium dilatatum proles tanacetifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kidney fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the Dryopteridaceae family."
