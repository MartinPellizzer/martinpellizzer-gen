It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical climates. Due to its unique morphology and cultural significance, it is often valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
