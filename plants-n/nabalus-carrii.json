It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or chaparral habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
