    "intro": "Nephrolepis volubilis, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a climbing evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive plant."
