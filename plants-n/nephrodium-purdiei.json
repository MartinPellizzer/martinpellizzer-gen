    "intro": "Nephrodium purdiei, commonly known as the Purdie's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to South Africa. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and pools. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium purdiei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms."
