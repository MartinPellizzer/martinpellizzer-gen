    "intro": "Neottia corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in forested areas. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its unique structure allows it to form symbiotic relationships with other plants, particularly trees and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of visible leaves, it plays a specialized role in forest ecosystems."
