    "intro": "Neokeithia torulosa, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, yellowish-green floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a delicate, waxy appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neokeithia torulosa is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
