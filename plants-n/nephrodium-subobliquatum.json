    "intro": "Nephrodium subobliquatum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The slender kidney fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
