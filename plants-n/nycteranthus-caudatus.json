    "intro": "Nycteranthus caudatus, commonly known as the night-flowering morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces large, showy flowers that open at night and close by morning, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth habit, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its flowers are typically pale lavender to white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming pattern."
