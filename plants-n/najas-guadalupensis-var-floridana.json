    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis var. floridana, commonly known as Florida watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting native aquatic ecosystems."
