    "intro": "Nemophila liniflora, commonly known as the silverleaf flower or coastal bellflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or purple. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine silvery coating, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
