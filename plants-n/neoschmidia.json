    "intro": "Neoschmidia, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers. Neoschmidia species typically have wiry stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are often brightly colored, with vivid hues of yellow, orange, and red, making them highly ornamental. Due to their beauty and rarity, Neoschmidia species are often cultivated in greenhouses and are popular among orchid enthusiasts."
