    "intro": "Natrix crispa, commonly known as the smooth water snake, is a species of non-venomous snake found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender body and smooth, glossy scales that give it its common name. This semi-aquatic species is often found near freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Its diet primarily consists of fish, amphibians, and small invertebrates. The plant aspect of Natrix crispa is not applicable, as it is an animal, not a botanical species."
