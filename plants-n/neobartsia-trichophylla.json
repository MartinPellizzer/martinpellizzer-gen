It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Neobartsia trichophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
