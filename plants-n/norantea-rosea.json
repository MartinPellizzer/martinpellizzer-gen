    "intro": "Norantea rosea, commonly known as the Pink Moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers typically open around dusk and close by dawn, making it a rare sight during the day. Norantea rosea is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and ample sunlight."
