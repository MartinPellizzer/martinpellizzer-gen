    "intro": "Nyssa sylvatica var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina ellipsoid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 feet and has a moderate growth rate. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine grain and durability."
