    "intro": "Nephrolepis caudata, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Nephrolepis caudata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
