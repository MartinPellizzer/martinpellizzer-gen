    "intro": "Notodanthonia bipartita var. fulva, commonly known as the golden sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often golden in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects."
