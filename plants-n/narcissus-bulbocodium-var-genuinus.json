    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. genuinus, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a cup-shaped corona. The plant produces a bulbous root system that allows it to survive in poor, dry soils. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
