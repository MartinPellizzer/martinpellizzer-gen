    "intro": "Nonea cesatiana, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Nonea cesatiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
