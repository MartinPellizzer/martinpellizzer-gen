    "intro": "Nanorrhinum petranum, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a short flowering period, usually in spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
