    "intro": "Nivieria, commonly known as the snowflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle elegance to its alpine habitat. Nivieria thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
