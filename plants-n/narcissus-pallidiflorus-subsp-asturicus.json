    "intro": "Narcissus pallidiflorus subsp. asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian daffodil, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with a white center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cooler, humid climates. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
