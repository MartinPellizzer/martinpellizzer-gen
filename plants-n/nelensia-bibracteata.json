    "intro": "Nelensia bibracteata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and its distinctive red, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in traditional medicine and craftsmanship. Nelensia bibracteata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
