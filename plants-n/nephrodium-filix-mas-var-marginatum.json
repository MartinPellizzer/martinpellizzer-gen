    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. marginatum, commonly known as the Variegated Male Fern, is a variant of the Male Fern characterized by its striking variegated foliage. This fern exhibits fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive central vein and a pale, often white or yellow margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution, resulting in a unique aesthetic appeal."
