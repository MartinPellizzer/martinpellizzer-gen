    "intro": "Neomitranthes nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
