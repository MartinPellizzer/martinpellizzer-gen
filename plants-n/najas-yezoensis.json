    "intro": "Najas yezoensis, commonly known as the Japanese watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in East Asia. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of other water plants. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and are arranged in dense clusters. Najas yezoensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
