    "intro": "Neobartsia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of red or purple. Its leaves are opposite and often have a glandular surface, which may play a role in its ecological interactions. Neobartsia glandulifera is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and woodland areas."
