    "intro": "Noccaea rotundifolia, commonly known as water pepper, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Noccaea rotundifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
