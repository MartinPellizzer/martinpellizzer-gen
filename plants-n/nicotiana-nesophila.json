    "intro": "Nicotiana nesophila, commonly known as the desert tobacco, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. This plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Nicotiana nesophila is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
