    "intro": "Nidularium linehamii, commonly known as the Hawaiian starling fern, is a rare and unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforest understories. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-like fronds that are composed of overlapping, strap-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with sporangia developing on the undersides of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nidularium linehamii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
