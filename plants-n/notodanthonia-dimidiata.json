    "intro": "Notodanthonia dimidiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Notodanthonia dimidiata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
