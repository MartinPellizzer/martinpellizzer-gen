    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered narcissus, is a rare and delicate plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single bulb that can give rise to multiple shoots, each bearing two to three flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
