    "intro": "Nigritella hygrophila var. pauciflora, commonly known as the swamp bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
