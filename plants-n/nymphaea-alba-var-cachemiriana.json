    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. cachemiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to the high-altitude regions of Jammu and Kashmir. It is characterized by its large, pale white petals and broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountain lakes and ponds. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life."
