    "intro": "Neottia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single, narrow spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically less than 1 cm in length. Neottia formosana is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter."
