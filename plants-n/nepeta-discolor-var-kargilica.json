It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens, particularly in cooler climates. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
