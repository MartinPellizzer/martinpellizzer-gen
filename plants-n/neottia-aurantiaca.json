    "intro": "Neottia aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Lady's Tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale yellow to orange flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Neottia aurantiaca is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
