The petals are broad and usually yellow, with a distinctive greenish center and a prominent, crown-like ring at the base of the petals. This variety is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and long blooming period in spring."
