    "intro": "Nemesia pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nemesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a subtle violet or red hue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short blooming period, typically in spring, adds a burst of color to gardens."
