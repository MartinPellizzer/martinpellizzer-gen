    "intro": "Neoregelia angustibracteolata, commonly known as the narrow bract neoregelia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Neoregelia angustibracteolata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and moderate humidity."
