    "intro": "Neohumbertiella decaryi, commonly known as the Decary\u2019s neohumbertiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in the humid, shaded understory of its habitat. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Neohumbertiella decaryi is considered a species of conservation concern."
