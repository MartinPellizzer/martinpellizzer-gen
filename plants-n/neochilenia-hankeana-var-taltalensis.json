    "intro": "Neochilenia hankeana var. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal lichen, is a rare foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to blackish thallus with a distinct, granular upper surface. The plant thrives in arid and coastal environments, particularly in Chile's Atacama Desert, where it forms dense mats on rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a thin, flattened body with a well-developed medulla and a cortex. This lichen is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation and is an important indicator species for arid ecosystems."
