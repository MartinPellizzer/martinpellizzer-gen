    "intro": "Nepenthes sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the mountains of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Nepenthes sanderiana is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
