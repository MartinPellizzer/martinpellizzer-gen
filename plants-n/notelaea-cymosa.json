    "intro": "Notelaea cymosa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Notelaea cymosa is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea breezes, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
