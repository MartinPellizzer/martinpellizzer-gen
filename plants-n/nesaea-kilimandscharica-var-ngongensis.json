    "intro": "Nesaea kilimandscharica var. ngongensis, commonly known as the Ngong rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, often in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong sunlight and low humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
