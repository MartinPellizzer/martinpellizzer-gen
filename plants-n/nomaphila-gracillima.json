    "intro": "Nomaphila gracillima, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees or in the canopy of dense vegetation. The plant features small, pale green leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. It is known for its unique morphology and is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered in many regions."
