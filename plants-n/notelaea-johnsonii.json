    "intro": "Notelaea johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's notelaea, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid lowland rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous minute seeds. It is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
