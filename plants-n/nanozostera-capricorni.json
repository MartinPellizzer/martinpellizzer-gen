It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like, blade-shaped leaves. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine species. Nanozostera capricorni plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its root system. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water currents, enhancing its ability to colonize new areas."
