    "intro": "Neo-urbania, commonly known as the urban forest tree, is a deciduous species native to temperate regions. It features broad, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that attract birds. Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and reduce erosion. Neo-urbania is often cultivated in urban landscapes for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
