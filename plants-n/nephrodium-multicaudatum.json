    "intro": "Nephrodium multicaudatum, commonly known as the multi-tailed kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature multiple, elongated pinnae resembling tails, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
