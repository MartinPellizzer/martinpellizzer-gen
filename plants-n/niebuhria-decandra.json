    "intro": "Niebuhria decandra, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which contributes to its common name. Niebuhria decandra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
