    "intro": "Neotrewia, commonly known as the \"bushy spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which store water to help them survive in arid conditions. Neotrewia species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in inflorescences. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
