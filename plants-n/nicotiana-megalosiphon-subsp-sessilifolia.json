It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies sessilifolia is distinguished by its sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a petiole."
