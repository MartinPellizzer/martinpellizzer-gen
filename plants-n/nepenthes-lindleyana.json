    "intro": "Nepenthes lindleyana, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, waxy leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a digestive fluid that attracts and traps insects, which are then broken down by enzymes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
