    "intro": "Notholaena distans, commonly known as the narrowleaf false lichen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with slender, linear lobes that give it a distinctive appearance. Notholaena distans is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in humid, temperate regions."
