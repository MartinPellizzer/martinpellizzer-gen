It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nerine sarniensis and Nerine echinata, combining characteristics of both parents. The plant is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. It typically grows as a bulbous perennial, producing foliage in early spring followed by blooms in late summer. The leaves are strap-like and grassy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers."
