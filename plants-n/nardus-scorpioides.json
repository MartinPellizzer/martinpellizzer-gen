    "intro": "Nardus scorpioides, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It has dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Nardus scorpioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and preventing erosion."
