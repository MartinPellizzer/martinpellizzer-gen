    "intro": "Nepenthes reinwardtiana, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a sticky nectar at the rim of its pitchers to lure prey, while its inner surface is lined with downward-pointing hairs that prevent escape. It thrives in high humidity and requires nutrient-poor soil, often growing as an epiphyte on trees. Its striking red and green coloration makes it a visually distinctive and highly sought-after species among plant enthusiasts."
