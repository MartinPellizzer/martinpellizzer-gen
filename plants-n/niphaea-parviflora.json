    "intro": "Niphaea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support its showy, white or pink flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water pollination, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. Niphaea parviflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
