    "intro": "Najas minor var. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents rather than insects. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. This species is often found in quiet, shallow waters such as ponds and marshes."
