    "intro": "Noccaea virens, commonly known as creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Noccaea virens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
