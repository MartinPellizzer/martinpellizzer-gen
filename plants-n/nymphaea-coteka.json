    "intro": "Nymphaea coteka, commonly known as the African water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom while its stems and leaves remain above water. Nymphaea coteka plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
