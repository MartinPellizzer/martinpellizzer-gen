    "intro": "Nassauvia nivalis var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf nassauvia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes."
