    "intro": "Nephelium glabrum, commonly known as the rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that are typically bright red or yellow when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface. The rambutan is valued for its edible, sweet, and juicy pulp, which is rich in vitamin C."
