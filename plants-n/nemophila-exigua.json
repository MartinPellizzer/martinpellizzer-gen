    "intro": "Nemophila exigua, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with white markings resembling eyes. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it spreads through seeds dispersed by wind. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
