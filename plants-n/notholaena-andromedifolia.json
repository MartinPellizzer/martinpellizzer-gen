    "intro": "Notholaena andromedifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a silvery sheen due to dense, fine hairs covering the foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Notholaena andromedifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
