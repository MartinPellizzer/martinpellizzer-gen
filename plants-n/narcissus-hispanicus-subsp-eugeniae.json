It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with flowers that are often more elongated and less showy than those of other daffodil species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
