    "intro": "Neomarica bulbosa, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, warm climates. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture. Neomarica bulbosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
