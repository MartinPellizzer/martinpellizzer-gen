    "intro": "Navarretia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flower or Sierra bells, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats such as meadows and slopes. Navarretia biflora is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes many species of bellflowers. Its short stature and ephemeral blooming period make it a notable but fleeting presence in its native environment."
