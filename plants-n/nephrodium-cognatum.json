    "intro": "Nephrodium cognatum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties. Nephrodium cognatum is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
