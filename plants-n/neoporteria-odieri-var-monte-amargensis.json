    "intro": "Neoporteria odieri var. monte-amargensis, commonly known as the Monte Amargue Neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or white, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
