    "intro": "Nephrodium decursive-pinnatum, commonly known as the curly fern, is a distinctive vascular plant characterized by its complex, decursive-pinnate leaf structure. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with each pinna subdivided into smaller segments, creating a feather-like appearance. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern where the fronds unfurl in a spiral manner, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
