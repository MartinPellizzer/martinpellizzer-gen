    "intro": "Nigella damascena, commonly known as black cumin or Roman coriander, is an annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces spherical, dark-colored seed pods that contain numerous tiny, aromatic seeds. These seeds are widely used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to their pungent, peppery flavor. Nigella damascena thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates."
