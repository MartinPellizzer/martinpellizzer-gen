    "intro": "Neanotis ingrata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved neanotis, is a variant of the Neanotis ingrata species, which is native to parts of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in arid and semi-arid environments."
