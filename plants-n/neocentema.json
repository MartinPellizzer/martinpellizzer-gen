    "intro": "Neocentema, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. Neocentema species produce showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
