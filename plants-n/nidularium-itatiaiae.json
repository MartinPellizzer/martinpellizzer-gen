    "intro": "Nidularium itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces significant threats to its survival."
