    "intro": "Norlindhia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves and clusters of delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Norlindhia is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and unique appearance. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
