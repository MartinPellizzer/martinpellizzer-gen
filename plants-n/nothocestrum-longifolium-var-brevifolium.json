    "intro": "Nothocestrum longifolium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved bellflower, is a variant of the bellflower species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical variety, which contributes to its distinct appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native gardens."
