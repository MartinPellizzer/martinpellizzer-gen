    "intro": "Nepeta lanceolata var. candolleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catnip, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild catnip scent, which is less intense than that of common catnip."
