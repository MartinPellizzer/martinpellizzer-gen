    "intro": "Nervilia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean nerve orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the wet season. Nervilia borneensis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its delicate, intricate floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
