    "intro": "Nelsonia pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's Nelsonia, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nelsonia pohlii is considered a vulnerable species."
