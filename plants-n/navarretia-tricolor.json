    "intro": "Navarretia tricolor, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white and pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often in areas with high elevations and cool climates. Navarretia tricolor is known for its short stature and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures."
