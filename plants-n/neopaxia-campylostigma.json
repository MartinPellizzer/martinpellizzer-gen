    "intro": "Neopaxia campylostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neopaxia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in forested or alpine environments. Its botanical features include leathery leaves with a dark green hue and clusters of white or pale pink blossoms that appear in late spring. Neopaxia campylostigma is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
