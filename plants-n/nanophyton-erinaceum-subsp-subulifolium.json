    "intro": "Nanophyton erinaceum subsp. subulifolium, commonly known as the spiny stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense mat of fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant's small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in clusters during the spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its compact size and resilience, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
