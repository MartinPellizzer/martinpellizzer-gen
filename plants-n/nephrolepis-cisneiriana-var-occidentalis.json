    "intro": "Nephrolepis cisneiriana var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western maidenhair fern, is a rare and elegant fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
