It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Neobotrydium pumilio is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions. Its growth pattern and morphology make it an important component of microhabitats in woodland ecosystems."
