    "intro": "Neowedia affinis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family. Neowedia affinis thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
