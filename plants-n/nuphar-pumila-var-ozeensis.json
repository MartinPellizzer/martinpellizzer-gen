    "intro": "Nuphar pumila var. ozeensis, commonly known as the Ozeen swamp waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, edible fruits that are dispersed by water. This variety is notable for its adaptability to nutrient-rich, muddy substrates and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
