    "intro": "Nepenthes diatas, commonly known as the \"highland pitcher plant,\" is a tropical vine native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down prey. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and its tendrils help it climb and spread through dense vegetation. Nepenthes diatas thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of carnivorous plants."
