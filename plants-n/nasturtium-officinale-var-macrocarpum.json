    "intro": "Nasturtium officinale var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant nasturtium, is a variant of the common nasturtium characterized by its large, showy flowers and edible leaves. This plant is native to South America and thrives in temperate climates, often growing in gardens and wild areas. Its flowers, which can reach up to 5 inches in diameter, come in shades of orange, red, and yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a peppery taste that makes them suitable for culinary use. It is a vigorous annual that prefers full sun and well-drained soil, often used both ornately and for its edible qualities."
