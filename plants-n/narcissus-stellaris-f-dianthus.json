    "intro": "Narcissus stellaris f. dianthus, commonly known as the star narcissus or dianthus narcissus, is a botanical hybrid that combines features of both narcissus and dianthus species. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year."
