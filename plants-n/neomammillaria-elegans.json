    "intro": "Neomammillaria elegans, commonly known as the elegant mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and is often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
