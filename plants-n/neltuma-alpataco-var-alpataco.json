    "intro": "Neltuma alpataco var. alpataco, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
