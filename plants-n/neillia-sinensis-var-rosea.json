    "intro": "Neillia sinensis var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored Chinese evergreen, is a hybrid cultivar of the Neillia sinensis plant. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-pink variegated leaves, which contrast with its dark green central veins. This plant is native to China and is often cultivated as a decorative foliage plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It prefers indirect light and moderate humidity, making it suitable for indoor environments. The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production."
