It is characterized by its striking, large, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, glandular stems and leaves. Its flowers are usually pale purple to white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that becomes more pronounced in the evening. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique blooming habit."
