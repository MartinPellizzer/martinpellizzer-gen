    "intro": "Nolina greenei, commonly known as the Greene's nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that appear in clusters at the tips of the stems. Nolina greenei is a slow-growing plant that is well adapted to dry, hot climates and requires minimal water once established."
