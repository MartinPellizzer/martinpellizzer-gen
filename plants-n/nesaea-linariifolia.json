    "intro": "Nesaea linariifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nesaea, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
