    "intro": "Nomaphila glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip petal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
