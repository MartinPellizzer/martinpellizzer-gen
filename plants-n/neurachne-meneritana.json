    "intro": "Neurachne meneritana, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Neurachne meneritana produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its habitat."
