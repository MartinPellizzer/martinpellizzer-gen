    "intro": "Nepeta lupulina, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta lupulina is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its unique interaction with felines."
