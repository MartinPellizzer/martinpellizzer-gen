    "intro": "Nicolletia trifida, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery seed heads that resemble smoke, which appear after the plant has bloomed. The plant typically grows in prairies and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. Nicolletia trifida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
