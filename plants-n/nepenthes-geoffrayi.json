    "intro": "Nepenthes geoffrayi, commonly known as the Borneo bottle plant, is a tropical climbing pitcher plant native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall and specific soil conditions. Nepenthes geoffrayi is notable for its ability to capture and digest small animals, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
