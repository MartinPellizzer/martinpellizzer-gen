    "intro": "Nolana confinis, commonly known as the coastal nolana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Nolana confinis is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
