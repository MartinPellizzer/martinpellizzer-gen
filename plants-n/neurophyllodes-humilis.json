    "intro": "Neurophyllodes humilis, commonly known as the lowland fern, is a small, delicate plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Neurophyllodes humilis exhibits a unique leaf structure with a single vein, typical of primitive ferns."
