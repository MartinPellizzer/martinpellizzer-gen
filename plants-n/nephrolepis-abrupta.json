    "intro": "Nephrolepis abrupta, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it well-suited for shady, moist environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Nephrolepis abrupta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
