It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive bluish waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
