    "intro": "Nepenthes celebica, commonly known as the Celebes pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Nepenthes celebica is also known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil, supplementing its diet with captured prey."
