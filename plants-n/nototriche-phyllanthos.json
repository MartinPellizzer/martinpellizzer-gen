It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season. Its bark and leaves contain milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally in some regions. Nototriche phyllanthos is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
