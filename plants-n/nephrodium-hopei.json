    "intro": "Nephrodium hopei, commonly known as the Hope's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Nephrodium hopei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
