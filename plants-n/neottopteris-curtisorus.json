    "intro": "Neottopteris curtisorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
