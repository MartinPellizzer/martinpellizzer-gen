    "intro": "Neoregelia dactyloflammans, commonly known as the flameleaf bromeliad, is a strikingly colorful plant native to Brazil. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vivid red, orange, and yellow hues, especially under bright light conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neoregelia dactyloflammans is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
