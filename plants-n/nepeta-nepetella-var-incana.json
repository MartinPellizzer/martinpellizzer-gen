    "intro": "Nepeta nepetella var. incana, commonly known as the woolly catnip, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain compounds like nepetalactone, which are responsible for its strong, minty scent and its ability to attract cats."
