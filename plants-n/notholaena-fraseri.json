    "intro": "Notholaena fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's hookless fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically unbranched. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Notholaena fraseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
