    "intro": "Nertera granadensis var. granadensis, commonly known as the Emerald Necklace, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are a striking bright green, often with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
