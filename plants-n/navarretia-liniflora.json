    "intro": "Navarretia liniflora, commonly known as the threadleaf navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pink flowers. This annual plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as coastal bluffs and grasslands. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Navarretia liniflora is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters."
