    "intro": "Nephrodium lonchodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often narrow leaf blades. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with a central rachis and multiple pinnae that are usually arranged in a bipinnate pattern. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
