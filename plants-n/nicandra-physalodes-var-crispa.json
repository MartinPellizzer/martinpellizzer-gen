It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces inflated, spiny fruits that resemble small gourds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a popular garden addition and a potential weed in some areas."
