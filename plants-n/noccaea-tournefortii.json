    "intro": "Noccaea tournefortii, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Noccaea tournefortii is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
