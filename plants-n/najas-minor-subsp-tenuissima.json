    "intro": "Najas minor subsp. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems if not managed."
