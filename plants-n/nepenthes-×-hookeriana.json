    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant produces large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and are often brightly colored to attract prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires a specific balance of light and nutrients to flourish."
