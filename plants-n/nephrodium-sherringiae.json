    "intro": "Nephrodium sherringiae, commonly known as the Sherring's holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a fleshy, glandular indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
