    "intro": "Nageia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant fan-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
