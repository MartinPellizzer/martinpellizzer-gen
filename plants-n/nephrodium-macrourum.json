    "intro": "Nephrodium macrourum, commonly known as the long-tendril nephroid, is a unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are often divided into narrow, linear segments with a somewhat zigzag appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Nephrodium macrourum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
