    "intro": "Nocca latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf nocca, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often prominently veined and have a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Nocca latifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
