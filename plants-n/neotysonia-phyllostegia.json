It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with a sprawling habit that makes it suitable for hedging or as a landscape plant.
