    "intro": "Nepenthes sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil, often found in montane rainforests. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and are typically green or red in color, depending on the species variant. The plant's ability to trap prey is an adaptation to its nutrient-deficient habitat, allowing it to supplement its nutritional needs."
