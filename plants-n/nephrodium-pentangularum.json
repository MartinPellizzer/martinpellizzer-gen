    "intro": "Nephrodium pentangularum, commonly known as the five-angled nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique, pentagonal fronds. The plant features intricate, deeply lobed leaves that form a distinctive, almost geometric pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and its role in the study of fern evolution."
