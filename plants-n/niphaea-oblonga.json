    "intro": "Niphaea oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Niphaea oblonga plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
