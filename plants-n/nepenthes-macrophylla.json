    "intro": "Nepenthes macrophylla, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the highland regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, making it one of the largest pitcher plants in the genus. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured prey. Its vibrant red coloration, often with yellow markings, serves to attract insects. Nepenthes macrophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
