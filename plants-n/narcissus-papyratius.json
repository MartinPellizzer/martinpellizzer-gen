    "intro": "Narcissus papyratius, commonly known as the paperwhite narcissus, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many narcissus species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in indoor gardening due to its ability to thrive in cool, dark conditions. The flowers are also used in perfumery because of their strong, sweet scent."
