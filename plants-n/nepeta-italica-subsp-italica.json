    "intro": "Nepeta italica subsp. italica, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of nepetalactone. This species is often grown for its ornamental value and as a natural attractant for cats."
