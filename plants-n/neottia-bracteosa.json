    "intro": "Neottia bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, which is usually greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are reduced to sheathing bracts, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Neottia. Neottia bracteosa is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
