    "intro": "Nepenthes edwardsiana subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, which are used to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with acidic soil, often growing in cloud forests. Its pitchers are typically green or red in color, depending on the light conditions, and produce a sticky fluid to lure prey. This subspecies is notable for its ability to capture larger prey compared to other Nepenthes species."
