    "intro": "Noaea canescens var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriuscula has reduced hair coverage, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
