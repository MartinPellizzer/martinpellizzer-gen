It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically a bright yellow-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the heat of the day. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring shallow waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its small size makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
