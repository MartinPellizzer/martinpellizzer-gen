    "intro": "Notholaena nealleyi var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican flat moss, is a variant of the genus Notholaena, which belongs to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, leafy shoots that are often covered in a thin layer of rhizoids. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a narrow, linear shape, with a distinct midrib and a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. This moss is adapted to humid climates and is often found in regions with high rainfall and cool temperatures."
