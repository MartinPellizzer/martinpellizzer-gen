    "intro": "Nephrolepis splendens, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a tropical fern native to the Americas. It features long, arching fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, glossy green segments. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its rhizomes spread along the soil surface, allowing it to form dense, lush foliage. Nephrolepis splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
