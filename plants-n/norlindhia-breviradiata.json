It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy surface. Norlindhia breviradiata is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, and it plays a role in supporting local insect pollinators."
