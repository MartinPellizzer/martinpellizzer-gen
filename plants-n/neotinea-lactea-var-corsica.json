    "intro": "Neotinea lactea var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink or white, with a unique, spurred corolla. This species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for certain pollinators and serving as a host plant for specific butterfly species."
