    "intro": "Neottopteris cymbifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Neottopteris cymbifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
