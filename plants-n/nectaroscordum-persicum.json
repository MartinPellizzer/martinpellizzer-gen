    "intro": "Nectaroscordum persicum, commonly known as the Persian daffodil, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a cluster of small, white, flower-like structures called spatheate bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and unique floral structure."
