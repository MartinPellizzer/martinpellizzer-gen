It features a robust root system and erect, branching stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Napaea hermaphrodita is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
