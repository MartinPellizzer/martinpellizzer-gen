    "intro": "Neomammillaria solisii, commonly known as the Solisii Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a smooth, pale green to blue-green stem with prominent, radial ribs that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Neomammillaria solisii is prized for its unique shape and low maintenance requirements."
