    "intro": "Nasturtium bipinnatum, commonly known as the doubleleaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often deeply lobed and resemble those of a watercress. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Tropaeolaceae family. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery, slightly spicy flavor, making it a popular herb in culinary applications. Nasturtium bipinnatum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental gardening as well."
