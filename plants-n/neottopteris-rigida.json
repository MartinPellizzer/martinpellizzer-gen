    "intro": "Neottopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Neottopteris rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
