    "intro": "Nepenthes distillatoria, commonly known as the giant sun pitcher, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, yellow-orange pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid. The plant's unique feature is its ability to distill rainwater, which it uses to attract and trap prey. Its nectar-secreting glands lure insects, while the slippery inner surface of the pitcher prevents them from escaping. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is a popular subject in botanical research due to its specialized adaptations."
