It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep blue, depending on the time of day and environmental conditions. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing a habitat for various aquatic life. The flower's ability to change color is a unique botanical feature that aids in pollination by attracting different pollinators at different times."
