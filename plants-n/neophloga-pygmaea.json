    "intro": "Neophloga pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flameplant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Neophloga pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
