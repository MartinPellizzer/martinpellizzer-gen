    "intro": "Nemophila heterophylla var. tenera, commonly known as the soft-leaved blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically rounded and soft to the touch, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Nemophila. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. This variety is known for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
