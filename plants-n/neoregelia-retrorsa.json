    "intro": "Neoregelia retrorsa, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety moss-like coating. The leaves are typically dark green with red or purple tips, creating a dramatic visual effect. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
