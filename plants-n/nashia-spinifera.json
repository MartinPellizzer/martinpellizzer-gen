It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Nashia spinifera thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
