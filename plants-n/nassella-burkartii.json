    "intro": "Nassella burkartii, commonly known as Burkart's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
