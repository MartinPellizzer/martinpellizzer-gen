    "intro": "Nephrodium dickinsii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the leaves of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Nephrodium dickinsii is considered endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest."
