    "intro": "Nabalus quercifolius, commonly known as the maple-leafed nabalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Nabalus quercifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
