    "intro": "Nephrodium marginale var. umbilicatum, commonly known as the umbilicated nephroid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a central umbilical scar, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
