    "intro": "Nandina domestica f. longifolia, commonly known as the variegated holly or the Japanese laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically edible for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
