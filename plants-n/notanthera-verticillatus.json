    "intro": "Notanthera verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with opposite leaves along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Its stems are hairy and can become woody with age, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Notanthera verticillatus is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to support pollinators and its ornamental foliage."
