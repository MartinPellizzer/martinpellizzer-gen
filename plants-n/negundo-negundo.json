    "intro": "Negundo negundo, commonly known as the boxleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into samaras, or winged seeds, for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
