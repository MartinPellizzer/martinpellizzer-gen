    "intro": "Nepeta lanata, commonly known as lamb's tongue catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its woolly, fuzzy leaves that give it a soft, almost velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Nepeta lanata thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it both ornamental and attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
