    "intro": "Nervilia lanyuensis, commonly known as the Lanyu fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Lanyu in Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
