    "intro": "Nellica, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that reflect light like a ghostly shimmer, giving it its otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of scientific fascination. Nellica thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
