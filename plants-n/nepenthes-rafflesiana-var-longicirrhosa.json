    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana var. longicirrhosa, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcher plant, is a striking tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, slender stem and vibrant red or orange-colored pitchers that serve as both a lure and a trap for prey. It thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing epiphytically on trees. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and its role in ecological studies of carnivorous plants."
