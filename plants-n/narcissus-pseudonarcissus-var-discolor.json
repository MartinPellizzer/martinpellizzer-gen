    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. discolor, commonly known as the white narcissus or the double white daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its white, cup-shaped flowers with a yellow corona, which distinguishes it from other narcissus varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in early spring. The varietal name 'discolor' refers to the subtle color variation in its petals, which can show a faint greenish or pinkish hue."
