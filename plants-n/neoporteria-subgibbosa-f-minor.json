    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf neoporteria, is a rare and compact variant of the Neoporteria subgibbosa species. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and reduced growth habit compared to the typical form. The plant features elliptical to ovate leaves that are often densely packed, giving it a bushy appearance. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
