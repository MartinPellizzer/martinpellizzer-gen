    "intro": "Nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Asia and the Americas. Its most notable botanical feature is its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks rising from water. The plant has a distinctive palmately lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Nelumbo species are known for their ability to thrive in shallow water, often forming dense colonies in ponds and marshes. The plant's unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in both natural and cultural contexts."
