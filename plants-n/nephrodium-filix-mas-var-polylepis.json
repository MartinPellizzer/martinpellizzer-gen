    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. polylepis, commonly known as the Polylepis fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Andean highlands. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
