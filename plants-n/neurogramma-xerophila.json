    "intro": "Neurogramma xerophila, commonly known as the desert fern, is a species of fern that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and drought-resistant adaptations. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its rhizomes are often covered in a protective layer of fine hairs. It is typically found in rocky soils and crevices, where it can access limited moisture. Neurogramma xerophila plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
