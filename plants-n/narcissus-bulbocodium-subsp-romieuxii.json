    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. romieuxii, commonly known as the Romieux's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, funnel-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, adding a touch of color to woodland or meadow habitats. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or naturalized areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and appreciation."
