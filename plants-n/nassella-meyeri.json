    "intro": "Nassella meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Nassella meyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
