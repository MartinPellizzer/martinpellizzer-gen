    "intro": "Neophloga simianensis, commonly known as the primate orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that resemble the appearance of a primate face, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neophloga simianensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
