    "intro": "Neolindenia, commonly known as the African maple, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees with attractive, palmate leaves. The leaves are typically lobed and often have a striking coloration, ranging from green to reddish hues. Neolindenia species produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
