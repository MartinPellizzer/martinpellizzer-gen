    "intro": "Narcissus spurius, commonly known as the meadow daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Narcissus spurius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
