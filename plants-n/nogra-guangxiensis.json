It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
