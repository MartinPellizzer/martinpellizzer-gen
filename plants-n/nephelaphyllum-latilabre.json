    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum latilabre, commonly known as the broad-lipped cloud flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in misty, cool environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is typically found growing in rocky crevices or on slopes where the soil is shallow and nutrient-poor. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
