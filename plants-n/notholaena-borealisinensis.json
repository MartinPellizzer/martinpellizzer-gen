    "intro": "Notholaena borealisinensis, commonly known as the northern alpine fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of northern China. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
