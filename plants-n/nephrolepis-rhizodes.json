    "intro": "Nephrolepis rhizodes, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a slender, arching appearance, and they are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
