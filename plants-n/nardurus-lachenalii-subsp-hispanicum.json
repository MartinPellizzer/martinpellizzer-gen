    "intro": "Nardurus lachenalii subsp. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish nard, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Spain. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant is known for its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are finely divided, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
