It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies in dryland ecosystems."
