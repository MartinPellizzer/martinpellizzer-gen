    "intro": "Neooreophilus sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display a mix of purple, white, and yellow hues. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cloud forest environments. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
