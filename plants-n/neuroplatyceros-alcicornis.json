    "intro": "Neuroplatyceros alcicornis, commonly known as the slender torch orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, with distinctive, elongated sepals and petals. Its growth is slow and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
