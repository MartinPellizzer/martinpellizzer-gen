    "intro": "Nepenthes phyllamphora var. pediculata, commonly known as the pediculate pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form elongated pitcher-shaped structures. The plant produces a single, often large, inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish and secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition."
