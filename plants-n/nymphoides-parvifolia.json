    "intro": "Nymphoides parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, smooth, pale green leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Nymphoides parvifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
