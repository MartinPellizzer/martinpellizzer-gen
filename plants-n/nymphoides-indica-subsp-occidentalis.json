    "intro": "Nymphoides indica subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It features floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy surface, and produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
