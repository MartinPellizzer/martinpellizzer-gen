It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and forest edges. Neochilenia flaviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
