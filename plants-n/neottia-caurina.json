    "intro": "Neottia caurina, commonly known as the yellow adder's mouth, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers, which resemble the shape of an adder's mouth, and its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia caurina is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
