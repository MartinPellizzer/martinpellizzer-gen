    "intro": "Narketis sulcata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Narketis sulcata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
