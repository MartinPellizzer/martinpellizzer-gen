    "intro": "Nerine, commonly known as the rain lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Nerine species typically have strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. Some species are also used in traditional medicine."
