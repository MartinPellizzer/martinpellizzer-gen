    "intro": "Nephrolepis mollis, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective shield known as a indusium. Nephrolepis mollis prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions contribute to its ornamental value."
