    "intro": "Neomammillaria herrerae var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white or pale blue spines, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and unique features, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts and conservationists."
