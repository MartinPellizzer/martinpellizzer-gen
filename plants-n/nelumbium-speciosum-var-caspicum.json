    "intro": "Nelumbium speciosum var. caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It features large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are floating or semi-submerged, depending on the water conditions. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
