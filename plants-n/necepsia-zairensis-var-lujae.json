    "intro": "Necepsia zairensis var. lujae, commonly known as the Zaire mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This orchid is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, elongated seed pods. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
