    "intro": "Nephrodium variabile var. normale, commonly known as the variable nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
