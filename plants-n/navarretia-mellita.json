It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. Navarretia mellita is known for its short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
