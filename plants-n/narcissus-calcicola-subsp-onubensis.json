    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. onubensis, commonly known as the Onubian narcissus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in southern Spain. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. It is closely related to other narcissus species but is distinguished by its specific morphological and genetic traits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
