    "intro": "Nesodraba megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant seed-bearing plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, woody structure and distinctive, elongated fruits that can grow up to several centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a thick, fleshy covering, which aids in their dispersal by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nesodraba megalocarpa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
