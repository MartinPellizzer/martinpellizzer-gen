    "intro": "Nyctocereus chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal night bloom, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a climbing cactus with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a unique ability to store water in its stems. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soil."
