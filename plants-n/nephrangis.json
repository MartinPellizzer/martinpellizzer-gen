    "intro": "Nephrangis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their kidney-shaped leaves, which give them their common name. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Nephrangis species produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for their ecological importance."
