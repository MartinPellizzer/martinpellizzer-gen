    "intro": "Narcissus romieuxii subsp. riffanus, commonly known as the Rif narcissus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of North Africa, particularly in the Rif Mountains of Morocco. This subspecies is characterized by its elegant, white flowers with a yellow corona, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
