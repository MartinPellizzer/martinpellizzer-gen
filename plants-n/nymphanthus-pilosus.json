    "intro": "Nymphanthus pilosus, commonly known as the silky catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white and pink. Its fruit is a long, spindle-shaped pod that splits open to release its seeds. Nymphanthus pilosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
