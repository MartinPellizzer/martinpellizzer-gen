    "intro": "Nabalus glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for survival in rocky or sandy soils. Nabalus glaucus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks."
