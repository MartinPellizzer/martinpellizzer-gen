    "intro": "Narcissus nevadensis subsp. enemeritoi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and meadows. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a distinct greenish throat. Its bulbs are adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution."
