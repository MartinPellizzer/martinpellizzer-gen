    "intro": "Nonatelia helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or yellow and are an important food source for birds. Nonatelia helferi is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive."
