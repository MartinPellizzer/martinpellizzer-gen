It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, edible flowers in shades of orange and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental and edible plants.
