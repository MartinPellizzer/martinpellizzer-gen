    "intro": "Nabalus altissimus var. ovatus, commonly known as the ovate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
