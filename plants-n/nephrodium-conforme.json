    "intro": "Nephrodium conforme, commonly known as the conforming kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green presence throughout the year."
