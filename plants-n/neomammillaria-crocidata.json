    "intro": "Neomammillaria crocidata, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
