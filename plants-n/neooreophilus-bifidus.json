    "intro": "Neooreophilus bifidus, commonly known as the Split-leaf Mountain Fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its bifid (split) leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Neooreophilus bifidus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
