It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds."
