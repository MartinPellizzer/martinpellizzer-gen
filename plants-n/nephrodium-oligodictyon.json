    "intro": "Nephrodium oligodictyon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in compact clusters along the leaf margins."
