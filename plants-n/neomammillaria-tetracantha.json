    "intro": "Neomammillaria tetracantha, commonly known as the four-armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Neomammillaria tetracantha is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
