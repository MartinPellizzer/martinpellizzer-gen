    "intro": "Neotinea intacta f. tridentata, commonly known as the tridentate fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. The fronds are deeply divided into three prominent lobes, giving it the name \"tridentate,\" which refers to its three-pronged appearance. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neotinea intacta f. tridentata is considered a delicate and ecologically significant plant."
