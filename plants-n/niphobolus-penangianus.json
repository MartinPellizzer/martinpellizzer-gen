It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a single, slender seta leading to a capsule that is often curved. Niphobolus penangianus is primarily found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Singapore."
