    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic narcissus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant grows from a bulb and prefers well-drained, sandy soils in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in maritime dunes and coastal woodlands, where it thrives in the unique microclimate provided by the proximity to the sea. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
