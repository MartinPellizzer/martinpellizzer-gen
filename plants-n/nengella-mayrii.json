    "intro": "Nengella mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii's nengella, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nengella mayrii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
