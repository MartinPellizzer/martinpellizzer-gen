    "intro": "Nolana parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Nolana parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in Mediterranean climates."
