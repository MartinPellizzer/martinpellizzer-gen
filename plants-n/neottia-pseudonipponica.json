    "intro": "Neottia pseudonipponica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its two narrow, grass-like leaves and its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Neottia pseudonipponica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
