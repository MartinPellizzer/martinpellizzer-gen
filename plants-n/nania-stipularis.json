    "intro": "Nania stipularis, commonly known as the stipular nania, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Nania stipularis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
