    "intro": "Nogra grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal dunes of southern California. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nogra grahamii is considered a species of conservation concern."
