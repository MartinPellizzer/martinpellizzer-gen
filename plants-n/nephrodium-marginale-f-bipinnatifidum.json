    "intro": "Nephrodium marginale f. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that arise from the base. Its leaves are typically slender and have a delicate, lace-like appearance due to their finely serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. The botanical structure of this fern reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with a focus on efficient water retention and light capture."
