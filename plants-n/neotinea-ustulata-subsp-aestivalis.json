    "intro": "Neotinea ustulata subsp. aestivalis, commonly known as the spring marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. The subspecies aestivalis is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other subspecies of Neotinea ustulata."
