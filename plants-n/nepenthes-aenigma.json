    "intro": "Nepenthes aenigma, commonly known as the mysterious pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique carnivorous adaptations, featuring modified leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped traps. These traps secrete a digestive fluid that lures and dissolves insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. The plant's morphology includes a slender stem and striking, waxy green foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
