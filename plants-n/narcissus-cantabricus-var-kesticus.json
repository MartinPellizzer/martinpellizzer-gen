    "intro": "Narcissus cantabricus var. kesticus, commonly known as the Cantabrian daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated corona. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is known for its early spring bloom. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
