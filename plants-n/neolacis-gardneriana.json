    "intro": "Neolacis gardneriana, commonly known as the Gardner's neolacis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
