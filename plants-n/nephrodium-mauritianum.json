    "intro": "Nephrodium mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Nephrodium mauritianum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
