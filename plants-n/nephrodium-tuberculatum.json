    "intro": "Nephrodium tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough bladder fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
