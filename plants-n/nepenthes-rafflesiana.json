    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sweet nectar to lure insects, which then fall into the liquid-filled cavity. The plant is also notable for its ability to trap and digest small vertebrates such as rodents and birds. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
