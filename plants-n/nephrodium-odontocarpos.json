    "intro": "Nephrodium odontocarpos, commonly known as the toothed kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy tissue, which helps in moisture retention. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
