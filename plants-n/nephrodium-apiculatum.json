    "intro": "Nephrodium apiculatum, commonly known as the apiculate nephroid, is a species of aquatic fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Nephrodium apiculatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
