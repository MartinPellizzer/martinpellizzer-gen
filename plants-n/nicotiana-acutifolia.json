    "intro": "Nicotiana acutifolia, commonly known as the acuteleaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. It produces a toxic alkaloid-rich seed capsule, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
