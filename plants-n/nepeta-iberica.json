    "intro": "Nepeta iberica, commonly known as the Iberian catmint, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are aromatic and often have a mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta iberica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and borders."
