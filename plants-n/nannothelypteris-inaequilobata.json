    "intro": "Nannothelypteris inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-sided huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinct asymmetry in the shape of its pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
