    "intro": "Nassella arcuata, commonly known as the curly needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, curved leaves and produces feathery, silver-gray seed heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its fine, wiry foliage gives it a delicate appearance, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Nassella arcuata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
