    "intro": "Nephrodium acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaf nephroid, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium acutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
