    "intro": "Nolina rigida, commonly known as the rigid nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its rosette of stiff, fibrous leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette during the warmer months. Nolina rigida is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
