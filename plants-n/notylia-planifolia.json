    "intro": "Notylia planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf notylia, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, a common feature in the Araceae family. Notylia planifolia is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
