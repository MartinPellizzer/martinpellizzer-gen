    "intro": "Narvalina homogama, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
