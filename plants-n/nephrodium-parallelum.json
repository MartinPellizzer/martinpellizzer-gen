    "intro": "Nephrodium parallelum, commonly known as the parallel fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
