    "intro": "Nymphaea nouchali, commonly known as the sacred water lily, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface, and its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the aquatic substrate. Nymphaea nouchali plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
