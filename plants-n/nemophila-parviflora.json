    "intro": "Nemophila parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to California. It features delicate, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. Due to its short life cycle and rapid growth, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
