    "intro": "Nephrodium obliteratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae, characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
