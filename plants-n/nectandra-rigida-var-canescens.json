    "intro": "Nectandra rigida var. canescens, commonly known as the white sand cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and swampy areas. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
