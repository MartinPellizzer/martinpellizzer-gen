    "intro": "Neblinaea promontoriorum, commonly known as the promontory mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz that helps reflect sunlight. Neblinaea promontoriorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
