    "intro": "Nephrodium irriguum, commonly known as the water kidney fern, is a unique aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving streams and wetlands, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrodium irriguum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
