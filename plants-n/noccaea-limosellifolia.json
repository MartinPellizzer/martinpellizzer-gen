    "intro": "Noccaea limosellifolia, commonly known as water pennywort, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its stems are often submerged, while the leaves may float on the water surface. Noccaea limosellifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms."
