    "intro": "Nephrodium duriusculum, commonly known as the rough nephrolepis, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are often covered in small, rough tubercles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
