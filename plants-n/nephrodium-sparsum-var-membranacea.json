    "intro": "Nephrodium sparsum var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
