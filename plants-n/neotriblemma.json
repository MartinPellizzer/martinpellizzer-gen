    "intro": "Neotriblemma, commonly known as the \"bushy false indigo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Neotriblemma is known for its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems and a dense, bushy appearance."
