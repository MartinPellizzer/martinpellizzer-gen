    "intro": "Nephrodium subconfluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
