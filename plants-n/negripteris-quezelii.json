    "intro": "Negripteris quezelii, commonly known as the Quezel's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble those of its more common relatives. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Negripteris quezelii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
