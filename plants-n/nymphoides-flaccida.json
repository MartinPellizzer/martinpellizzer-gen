    "intro": "Nymphoides flaccida, commonly known as the hanging water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its stems trail beneath the surface. Nymphoides flaccida is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
