    "intro": "Nepenthes suratensis, commonly known as the Surat pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. The plant produces nectar to lure prey into its hollow, digestive chambers lined with a waxy surface. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination. Nepenthes suratensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity for optimal growth."
