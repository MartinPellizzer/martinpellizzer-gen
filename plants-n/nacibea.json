    "intro": "Nacibea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, red berries that attract birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
