    "intro": "Nassella quinqueciliata, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottle brush, composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Nassella quinqueciliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
