    "intro": "Neltuma rojasiana, commonly known as the Rosas' Neltuma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that displays a range of hues from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often in high-altitude regions where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed leaves that form a water-holding cup, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma rojasiana is considered a conservation concern."
