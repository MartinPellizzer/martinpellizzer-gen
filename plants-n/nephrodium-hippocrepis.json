    "intro": "Nephrodium hippocrepis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds that are often divided into lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store moisture in arid conditions. Nephrodium hippocrepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
