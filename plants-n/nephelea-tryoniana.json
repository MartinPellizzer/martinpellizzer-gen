    "intro": "Nephelea tryoniana, commonly known as the Tryon's nephelea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nephelea tryoniana is often found in rich, loamy soils and is considered a relatively rare species in its native range."
