    "intro": "Notocactus neoarechavaletae var. maldonadensis, commonly known as the Maldonado Notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
