It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
