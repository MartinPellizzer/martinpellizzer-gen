    "intro": "Nannoseris inopinata, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit with short, erect stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nannoseris inopinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
