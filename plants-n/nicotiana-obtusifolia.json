    "intro": "Nicotiana obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids similar to those found in tobacco."
