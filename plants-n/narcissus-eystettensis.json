    "intro": "Narcissus eystettensis, commonly known as the Eystetten daffodil, is a rare and ornamental member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single prominent central corona, which is a defining feature of the daffodil genus. Native to the Alpine regions of Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring, producing clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Narcissus eystettensis is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
