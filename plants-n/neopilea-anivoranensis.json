    "intro": "Neopilea anivoranensis, commonly known as the Anivoranensis fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
