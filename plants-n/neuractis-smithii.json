    "intro": "Neuractis smithii, commonly known as Smith's cypress, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree with needle-like leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinctive cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-elevation habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
