    "intro": "Neurolepis villosa, commonly known as the hairy neurolepis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
