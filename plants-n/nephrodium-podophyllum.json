    "intro": "Nephrodium podophyllum, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
