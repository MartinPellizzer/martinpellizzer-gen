    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea f. terrestris, commonly known as the yellow water lily variant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy yellow flowers. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in sunny conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water, while its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
