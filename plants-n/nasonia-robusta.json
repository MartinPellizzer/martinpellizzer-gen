    "intro": "Nasonia robusta, commonly known as the robusta wasp, is a small parasitic wasp species belonging to the family Pteromalidae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it primarily parasitizes the larvae of various flies, including those of the family Tephritidae. The adult wasp has a distinctive black body with yellow markings, and its life cycle is closely tied to the host insect's development. Nasonia robusta plays a significant role in natural pest control by regulating fly populations. Its study is also valuable in evolutionary biology due to its short life cycle and genetic tractability."
