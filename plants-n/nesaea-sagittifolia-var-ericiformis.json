    "intro": "Nesaea sagittifolia var. ericiformis, commonly known as the Ericaceous Nesaea, is a variant of the arrowleaf nesaea, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. It is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple tinge, especially in cooler weather. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species."
