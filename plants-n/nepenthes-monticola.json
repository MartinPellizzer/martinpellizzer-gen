    "intro": "Nepenthes monticola, commonly known as the mountain pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Its pitchers are typically green or red in color, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Nepenthes monticola plays an important ecological role by supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
