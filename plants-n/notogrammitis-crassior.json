    "intro": "Notogrammitis crassior, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate, bright green leaves with a distinctive, glossy texture and a deeply divided, feather-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
