    "intro": "Nicolasia pedunculata subsp. thermalis, commonly known as the thermal nicolasia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in geothermal environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique foliage that often exhibits a bluish or silver hue due to a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, high-temperature soils found near hot springs and volcanic areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for geothermal activity and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
