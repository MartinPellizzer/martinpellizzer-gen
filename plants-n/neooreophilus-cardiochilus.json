    "intro": "Neooreophilus cardiochilus, commonly known as the heart-lipped orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive heart-shaped lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
