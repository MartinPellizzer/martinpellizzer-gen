    "intro": "Nasa rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf nasa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Nasa rugosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
