    "intro": "Nephrodium cyclodioides, commonly known as the cycloid fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cycloid-shaped fronds that are often spirally arranged around the stem. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, delicate leaves that are usually clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
