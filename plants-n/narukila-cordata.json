    "intro": "Narukila cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Narukila cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
