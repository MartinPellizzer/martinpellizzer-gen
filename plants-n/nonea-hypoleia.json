It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Nonea hypoleia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
