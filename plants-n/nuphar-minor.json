    "intro": "Nuphar minor, commonly known as the lesser water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom above the water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in shallow water and nutrient-rich mud. Its leaves are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter and have a distinctive notch at the base. Nuphar minor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
