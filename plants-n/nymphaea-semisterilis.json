    "intro": "Nymphaea semisterilis, commonly known as the semi-sterile water lily, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers typically open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea semisterilis is notable for its reduced fertility, as it often produces non-viable seeds, making vegetative propagation its primary means of reproduction."
