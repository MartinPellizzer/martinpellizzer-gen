    "intro": "Neoapaloxylon tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous apaloxylon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The tuberous roots of this plant are sometimes harvested for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
