    "intro": "Neuroloma albidum, commonly known as the white neurophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, and are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
