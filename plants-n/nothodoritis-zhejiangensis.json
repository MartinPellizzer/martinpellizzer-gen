    "intro": "Nothodoritis zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, sweet aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
