It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
