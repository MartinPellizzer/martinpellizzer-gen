    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. pallida, commonly known as the pale form of the bird's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish foliage and lacks the typical greenish-brown pseudobulbs found in other Neottia species. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single, showy white or pale yellow flower that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
