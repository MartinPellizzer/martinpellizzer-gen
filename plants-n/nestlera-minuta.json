It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is known for its compact size and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Nestlera minuta is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
