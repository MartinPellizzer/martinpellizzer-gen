    "intro": "Nyctago viscosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
