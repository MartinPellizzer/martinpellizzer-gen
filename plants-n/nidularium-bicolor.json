    "intro": "Nidularium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display two distinct colors, typically white and purple, on the same inflorescence. The plant has long, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, hooded flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern near the base. Nidularium bicolor thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
