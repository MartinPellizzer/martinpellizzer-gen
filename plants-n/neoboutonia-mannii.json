    "intro": "Neoboutonia mannii, commonly known as the pink bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Neoboutonia mannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
