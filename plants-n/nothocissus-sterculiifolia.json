    "intro": "Nothocissus sterculiifolia, commonly known as the desert grapevine, is a climbing plant native to arid regions of Central America. It features compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds. Nothocissus sterculiifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
