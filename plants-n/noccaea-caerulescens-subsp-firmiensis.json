    "intro": "Noccaea caerulescens subsp. firmiensis, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and small, clustered blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a valuable species in phytoremediation studies. Its ornamental value and ecological importance contribute to its presence in both natural and cultivated settings."
