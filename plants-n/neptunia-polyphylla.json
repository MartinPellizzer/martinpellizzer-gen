    "intro": "Neptunia polyphylla, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rosette-shaped foliage composed of broad, waxy leaves that remain above the water surface. The plant possesses specialized root systems that help anchor it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Neptunia polyphylla plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
