    "intro": "Niphogeton ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Niphogeton ternata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
