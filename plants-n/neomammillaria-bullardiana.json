    "intro": "Neomammillaria bullardiana, commonly known as the Bullard's fairy daisy, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are adorned with clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive."
