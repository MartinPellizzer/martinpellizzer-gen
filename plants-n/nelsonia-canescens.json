    "intro": "Nelsonia canescens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is adapted to poor soils and can survive in harsh desert conditions. Nelsonia canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
