It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, needle-like pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
