    "intro": "Nyssa sessiliflora, commonly known as the Florida waterleaf, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Nyssa sessiliflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
