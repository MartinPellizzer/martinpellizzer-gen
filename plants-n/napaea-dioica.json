    "intro": "Napaea dioica, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a taproot system and produces a distinctive, aromatic odor due to its essential oils. Napaea dioica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
