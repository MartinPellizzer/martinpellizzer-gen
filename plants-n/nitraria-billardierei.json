    "intro": "Nitraria billardierei, commonly known as the desert raisin, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellow or orange fruits that resemble grapes, which are edible and have a sweet, raisin-like flavor. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss and contribute to its drought tolerance. Nitraria billardierei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various wildlife species."
