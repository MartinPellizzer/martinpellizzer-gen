    "intro": "Nepeta gumerica, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. Its leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. Nepeta gumerica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its historical use in traditional medicine."
