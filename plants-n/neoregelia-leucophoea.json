    "intro": "Neoregelia leucophoea, commonly known as the white-veined bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common feature among bromeliads. The leaves are typically dark green with prominent white veins, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value. Neoregelia leucophoea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
