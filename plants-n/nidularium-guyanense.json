    "intro": "Nidularium guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana cup-moss, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Guyana and northern Brazil. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink. Nidularium guyanense is appreciated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
