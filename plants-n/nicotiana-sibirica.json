    "intro": "Nicotiana sibirica, commonly known as Siberian tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the cold climates of Siberia and other parts of northern Asia. The plant features strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated tobacco species and its adaptation to harsh environments."
