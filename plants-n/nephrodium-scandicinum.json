    "intro": "Nephrodium scandicinum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, fan-like appearance, and its leaves are typically bright green with a leathery texture. Nephrodium scandicinum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. It plays a role in the ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
