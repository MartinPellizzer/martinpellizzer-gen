    "intro": "Neottia nanchuanica, commonly known as the Nanchuan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, slender pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves that are usually green or bluish-green. Due to its restricted habitat and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
