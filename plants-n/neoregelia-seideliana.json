    "intro": "Neoregelia seideliana, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Bromeliad,\" is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that ranges from green to red, pink, and purple. The plant features a rosette-shaped structure with overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, emerge from the leaf axils and bloom in late summer or early fall. Neoregelia seideliana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
