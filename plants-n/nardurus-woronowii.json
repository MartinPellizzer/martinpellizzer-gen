    "intro": "Nardurus woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's nardus, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown florets. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
