    "intro": "Nephrodium amblyotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephroidiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium amblyotis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
