    "intro": "Nepeta ucranica subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered catmint, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often grown for its ornamental value and mild mint-like scent. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact growth habit."
