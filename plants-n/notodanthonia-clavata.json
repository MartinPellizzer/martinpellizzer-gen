    "intro": "Notodanthonia clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Notodanthonia clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
