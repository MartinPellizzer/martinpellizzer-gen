It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Neja has small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, similar to dandelions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
