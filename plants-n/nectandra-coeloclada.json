    "intro": "Nectandra coeloclada, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to its valuable wood, it is often harvested for its high-quality timber, though it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
