    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. pallescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tobacco, is a variant of the tobacco plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. This variety is less commonly cultivated for commercial tobacco but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
