    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous male fern, is a variant of the male fern species characterized by its distinctive frond structure. The plant features large, compound fronds with a fibrous, almost silky texture on the underside, which gives it its specific epithet \"fibrillosum.\" It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller segments. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant and intricate foliage."
