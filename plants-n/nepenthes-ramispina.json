    "intro": "Nepenthes ramispina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highland rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped traps. The plant produces a sticky fluid in its pitchers to lure and trap insects, which are then digested by enzymes. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant adaptation and evolution."
