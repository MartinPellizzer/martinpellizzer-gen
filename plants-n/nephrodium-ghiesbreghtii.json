    "intro": "Nephrodium ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
