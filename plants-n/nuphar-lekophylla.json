    "intro": "Nuphar lekophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive arrowhead shape at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically emerging from the water. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread along the edges of ponds and lakes. Nuphar lekophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
