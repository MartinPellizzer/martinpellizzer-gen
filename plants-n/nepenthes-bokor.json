    "intro": "Nepenthes bokor, commonly known as the Bokor Pitcher Plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Central Highlands of Cambodia. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique adaptations include a specialized waxy coating on its leaves that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne on a short stem above the pitchers. Nepenthes bokor is also notable for its ability to grow in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
