    "intro": "Nectandra turbacensis var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand-wood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, fleshy berries. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
