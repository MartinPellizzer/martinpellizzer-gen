    "intro": "Nematanthus, commonly known as the \"cape ivy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture, while the flowers come in a variety of colors including red, orange, and yellow. Nematanthus species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. They are also valued for their role in supporting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
