    "intro": "Neomammillaria haageana, commonly known as the Haage's milk barrel cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a ribbed stem covered in white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Neomammillaria haageana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
