    "intro": "Nepenthes ceciliae, commonly known as the Celestial Pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid. The plant's leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, misty habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, with bright red petals that attract pollinators. Nepenthes ceciliae is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by capturing and digesting insects."
