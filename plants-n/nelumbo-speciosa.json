    "intro": "Nelumbo speciosa, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom above the water's surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the foliage and flowers. Nelumbo speciosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
