    "intro": "Norantea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of these isolated tabletop mountains. Its growth is adapted to the specific microclimates and nutrient-poor soils of the tepuis. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
