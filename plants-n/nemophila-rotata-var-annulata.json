    "intro": "Nemophila rotata var. annulata, commonly known as the ringed blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to California. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or violet, with a distinctive white ring around the center. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. Its short flowering period, usually in spring, adds a splash of color to early-season gardens."
