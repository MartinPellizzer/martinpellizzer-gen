It features delicate, finely divided fronds with a distinctive pale green margin. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its graceful appearance."
