    "intro": "Nasturtium sublyratum, commonly known as the creeping nasturtium, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover or hanging baskets. Its flowers are edible, with a peppery flavor similar to watercress, and the leaves are also edible and often used in salads. Nasturtium sublyratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
