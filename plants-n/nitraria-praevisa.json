    "intro": "Nitraria praevisa, commonly known as the desert raisin tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and small, red or black fruits that resemble grapes. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, which helps minimize transpiration. Nitraria praevisa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded landscapes."
