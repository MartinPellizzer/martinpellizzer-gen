    "intro": "Nervilia infundibulifolia, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, helmet-shaped flower surrounded by a hood-like bract. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a rosette, and the flower has a distinct structure with a long, slender spur. Nervilia infundibulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
