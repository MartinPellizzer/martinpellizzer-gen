    "intro": "Nymphaea alba subsp. candida, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems support the foliage and flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pure white petals and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens."
