    "intro": "Nephrodium juglandifolium, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a vibrant green color, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. This fern is often found in forest floors and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
