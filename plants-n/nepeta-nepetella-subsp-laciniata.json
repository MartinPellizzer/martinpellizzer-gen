    "intro": "Nepeta nepetella subsp. laciniata, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is known for its strong scent, which is particularly attractive to cats due to the presence of nepetalactone. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
