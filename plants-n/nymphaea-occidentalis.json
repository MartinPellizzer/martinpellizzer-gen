    "intro": "Nymphaea occidentalis, commonly known as the Western water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its leaves float on the surface. The Western water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
