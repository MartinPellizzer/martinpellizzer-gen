It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically in shades of white and green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidorella burundiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
