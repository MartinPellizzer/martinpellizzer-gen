    "intro": "Nephrodium crinitum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a feathery structure. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with a hairy covering, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Nephrodium crinitum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
