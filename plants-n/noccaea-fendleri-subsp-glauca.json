    "intro": "Noccaea fendleri subsp. glauca, commonly known as blueleaf stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
