    "intro": "Nymphoides coronata, commonly known as the crowned water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive white, star-shaped flower that blooms in early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in shallow water or moist soil. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nymphoides coronata is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
