    "intro": "Neobartsia orthocarpiflora subsp. orthocarpiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
