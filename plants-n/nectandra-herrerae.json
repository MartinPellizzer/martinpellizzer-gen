    "intro": "Nectandra herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's sandarac tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into woody capsules. The tree produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural adhesives. Its growth habit includes a straight trunk and a dense canopy, making it suitable for reforestation efforts. The plant exhibits a preference for well-drained soils and is often found in humid, lowland forests."
