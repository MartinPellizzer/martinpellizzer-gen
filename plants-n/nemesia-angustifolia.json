    "intro": "Nemesia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf nemesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Nemesia angustifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
