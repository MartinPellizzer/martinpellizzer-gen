    "intro": "Nephrodium montanum, commonly known as the mountain nephroid, is a rare and specialized fern species native to high-altitude regions. It exhibits a unique morphology characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous habitats. Its reproductive structures are distinctive, featuring small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Nephrodium montanum is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
