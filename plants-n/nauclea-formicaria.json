    "intro": "Nauclea formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. One of its most distinctive features is the presence of specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help with nutrient cycling. The plant also produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
