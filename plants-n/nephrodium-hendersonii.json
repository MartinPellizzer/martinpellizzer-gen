    "intro": "Nephrodium hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are essential for its propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium hendersonii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
