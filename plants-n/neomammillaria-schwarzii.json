    "intro": "Neomammillaria schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz\u2019s pincushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive, spiny ribs that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its green body. Neomammillaria schwarzii is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
