    "intro": "Nathusia trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Nathusia trichoclada is considered a vulnerable species."
