    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola subsp. marvieri, commonly known as the Marvier\u2019s daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a prominent, trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often displaying a pale yellow to white coloration with a yellow corona. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
