    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis f. brevicylindrica, commonly known as the Islay neoporteria, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the Isle of Islay in Scotland. This fern-like plant exhibits a compact growth habit with short, cylindrical fronds that distinguish it from other members of the Neoporteria genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal heathlands and peat bogs. The plant's foliage is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive, narrow shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected under Scottish wildlife legislation."
