    "intro": "Nephrodium canariense, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
