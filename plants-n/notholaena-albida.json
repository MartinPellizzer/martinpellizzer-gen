    "intro": "Notholaena albida, commonly known as the white feather grass, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, white to pale green foliage. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles. Notholaena albida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
