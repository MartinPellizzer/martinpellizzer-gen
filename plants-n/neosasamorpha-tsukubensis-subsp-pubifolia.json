    "intro": "Neosasamorpha tsukubensis subsp. pubifolia, commonly known as the Japanese mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
