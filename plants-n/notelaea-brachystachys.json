    "intro": "Notelaea brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed notelaea, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
