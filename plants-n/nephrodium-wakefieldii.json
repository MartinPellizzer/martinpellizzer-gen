    "intro": "Nephrodium wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Nephrodium wakefieldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
