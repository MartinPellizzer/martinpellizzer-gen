    "intro": "Nelumbo speciosa var. tamara, commonly known as the Tamara lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom on tall, slender stalks above the water surface. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often float on the water's surface, providing a striking visual display. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
