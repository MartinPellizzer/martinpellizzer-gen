    "intro": "Nephrodium asplenioides subsp. sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dense, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, compact appearance with a waxy surface. The subsp. sclerophyllum is distinguished by its thick, durable leaves, which provide it with a competitive advantage in its natural habitat."
