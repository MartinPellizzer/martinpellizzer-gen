    "intro": "Nigritella lithopolitanica subsp. corneliana, commonly known as the Cornelian rock lichen, is a specialized lichen species that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to mineral surfaces. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its slow growth and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it a resilient indicator species for rocky habitats. This subspecies is often found in Mediterranean and temperate regions where it contributes to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
