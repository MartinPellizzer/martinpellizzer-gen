It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers during the warm season, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It has a slow growth rate and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
