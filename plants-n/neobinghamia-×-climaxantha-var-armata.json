    "intro": "Neobinghamia \u00d7 climaxantha var. armata, commonly known as the red-flowered bottlebrush, is a hybrid shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from spring to autumn."
