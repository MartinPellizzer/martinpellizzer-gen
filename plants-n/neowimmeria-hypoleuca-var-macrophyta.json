    "intro": "[WRONG START] Neowimmeria hypoleuca var. macrophyla, commonly known as the large-leafed neowimmeria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a fine, waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
