    "intro": "Nephrolepis bausei, commonly known as the Bause's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that resemble a sword in shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
