It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including antheridia and archegonia, are located on specialized leaves called gametophores. Nephrodium athyrioides plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
