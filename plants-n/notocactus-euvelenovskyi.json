    "intro": "Notocactus euvelenovskyi, commonly known as the Euvelenovsky's notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
