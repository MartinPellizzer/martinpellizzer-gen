It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a striking silvery underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. It thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Neillia hypomalaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
