    "intro": "Narcissus jonquilloides var. webbii, commonly known as the Webb's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
