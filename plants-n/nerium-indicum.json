    "intro": "Nerium indicum, commonly known as the oleander, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy clusters of pink, red, or white flowers. The plant is known for its high toxicity, as all parts contain cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The flowers bloom in summer and are often used in landscaping due to their vibrant colors and long-lasting display."
