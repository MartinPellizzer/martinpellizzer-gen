    "intro": "Nervilia dallachyana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forested areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in poor, well-drained soils. Nervilia dallachyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
