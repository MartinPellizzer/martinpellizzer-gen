It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and is characterized by its distinctive, large, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
