    "intro": "Nuphar japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a prominent yellow center, and bloom in early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
