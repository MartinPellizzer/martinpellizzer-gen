    "intro": "Nerisyrenia camporum, commonly known as the Camp's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the roots of trees or in swampy areas, where it derives moisture from the surrounding environment. Its flowers are relatively small but are often clustered in groups, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Nerisyrenia camporum is considered a vulnerable species."
