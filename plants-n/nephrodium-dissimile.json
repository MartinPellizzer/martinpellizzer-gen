    "intro": "Nephrodium dissimile, commonly known as the irregular kidney fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that resemble a kidney, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a broad, leathery texture and a deep green color. Nephrodium dissimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
