It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green foliage and smooth, pale bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by large, woody fruits containing aromatic resin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The resin from its fruits has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandarac, a natural varnish."
