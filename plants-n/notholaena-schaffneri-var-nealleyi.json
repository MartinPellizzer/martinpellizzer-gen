    "intro": "Notholaena schaffneri var. nealleyi, commonly known as Schaffner's fern, is a variant of the genus Notholaena, which belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Notholaena schaffneri, particularly in frond structure and spore morphology."
