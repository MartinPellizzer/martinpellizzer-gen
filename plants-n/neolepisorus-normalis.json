    "intro": "Neolepisorus normalis, commonly known as the common rock cap fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, dark brown spore capsules on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups of three. Neolepisorus normalis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its simple morphology and adaptability make it a resilient and widespread species in temperate regions."
