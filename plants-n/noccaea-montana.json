    "intro": "Noccaea montana, commonly known as mountain nephrolepis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, serrated leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Noccaea montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in moist, shady areas."
