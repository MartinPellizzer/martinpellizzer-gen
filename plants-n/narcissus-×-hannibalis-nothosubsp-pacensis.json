    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 hannibalis nothosubsp. pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from crosses between different daffodil species. It is characterized by its upright, strap-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to white. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that blooms in early spring, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-flowering bulbs. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that exemplifies the genetic diversity within the Narcissus genus."
