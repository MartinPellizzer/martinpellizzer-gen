    "intro": "Neooreophilus lunaris, commonly known as the Moonlit Orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowering period coincides with the full moon, enhancing its ethereal appearance. Botanists classify it as a member of the Orchidaceae family, noted for its complex floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms."
