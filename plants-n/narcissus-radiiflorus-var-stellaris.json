    "intro": "Narcissus radiiflorus var. stellaris, commonly known as the star-flowered daffodil, is a rare and striking variant of the daffodil species. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that radiate outward, creating a star-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal areas, preferring full sun. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists."
