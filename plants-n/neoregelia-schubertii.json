It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant colors, typically red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia schubertii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
