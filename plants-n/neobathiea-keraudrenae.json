    "intro": "Neobathiea keraudrenae, commonly known as the Keraudren's neobathiea, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, featuring tubular corollas that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Its study contributes to understanding the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of tropical rainforests."
