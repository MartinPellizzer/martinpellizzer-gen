    "intro": "Nicotiana alata, commonly known as the four o'clock plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of pink, red, yellow, and white, which attract pollinators such as moths and hummingbirds. Its leaves are ovate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Nicotiana alata is also known for its mild nicotine content and is sometimes grown for ornamental purposes or in educational settings for its unique blooming pattern."
