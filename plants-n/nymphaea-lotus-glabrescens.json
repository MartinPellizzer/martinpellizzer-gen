    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus glabrescens, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-lily species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, with a fragrant scent. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The sacred lotus is also notable for its symbolic significance in various cultures, particularly in Buddhism and Hinduism."
