    "intro": "Nolana tocopillensis, commonly known as the Tocopilla nolana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Nolana tocopillensis is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of the region."
