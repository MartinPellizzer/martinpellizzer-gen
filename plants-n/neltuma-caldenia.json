    "intro": "Neltuma caldenia, commonly known as the Caldenia neltuma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Neltuma caldenia is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
