    "intro": "Nesaea humilis, commonly known as the small nesaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
