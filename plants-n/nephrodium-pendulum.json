    "intro": "Nephrodium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that hang gracefully from its stems, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are bi-lobed and resemble kidney shapes, which is reflected in its scientific name. Nephrodium pendulum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
