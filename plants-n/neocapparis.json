These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their succulent, often blue or violet-colored leaves. Neocapparis species are native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where they thrive in saline and rocky environments. The flowers are usually small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. They are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, making them resilient and unique botanical specimens."
