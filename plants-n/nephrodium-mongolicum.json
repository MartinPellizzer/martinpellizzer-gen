    "intro": "Nephrodium mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian kidney fern, is a rare fern species native to the temperate regions of Mongolia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
