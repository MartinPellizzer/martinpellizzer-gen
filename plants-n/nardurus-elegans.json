It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Nardurus elegans is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
