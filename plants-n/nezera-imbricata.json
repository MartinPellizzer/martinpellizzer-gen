    "intro": "Nezera imbricata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
