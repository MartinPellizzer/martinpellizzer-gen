It features a ribbed stem covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a favored plant among cactus enthusiasts."
