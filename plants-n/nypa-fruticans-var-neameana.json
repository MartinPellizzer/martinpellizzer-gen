    "intro": "Nypa fruticans var. neameana, commonly known as the Neame's mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique morphology, including a single trunk and a crown of palm-like leaves. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense coastal forests. Its root system is adapted to oxygen-poor soils, with pneumatophores extending above the water to facilitate gas exchange. This species plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
