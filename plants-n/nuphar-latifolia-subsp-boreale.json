    "intro": "Nuphar latifolia subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically with a distinct, rounded shape. Its underwater roots form a dense network, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality. This subspecies is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes."
