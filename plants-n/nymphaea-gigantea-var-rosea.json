    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea var. rosea, commonly known as the giant pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, rose-colored flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies, allowing it to thrive in ponds and lakes. The botanical structure of this variety includes a robust rhizome system that supports its rapid growth and spread."
