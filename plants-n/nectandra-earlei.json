    "intro": "Nectandra earlei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark purple or black berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
