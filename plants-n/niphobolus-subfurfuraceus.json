    "intro": "Niphobolus subfurfuraceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Scarabaeidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety appearance with a dark, often reddish-brown coloration. The plant it is associated with, likely a host plant for its larvae, is typically a member of the Malvaceae family, such as cotton or related species. The beetle's life cycle involves feeding on plant tissues, which can cause damage to the host plant. Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a herbivore and a potential pest in agricultural settings."
