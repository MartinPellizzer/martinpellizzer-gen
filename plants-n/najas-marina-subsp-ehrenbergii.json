It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with soft sediment and moderate light penetration. This subspecies is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow streams, playing a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
