    "intro": "Nephrodium latebrosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
