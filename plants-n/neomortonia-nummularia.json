    "intro": "Neomortonia nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Neomortonia nummularia is a hardy perennial that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with full sun exposure."
