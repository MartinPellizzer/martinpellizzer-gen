    "intro": "Narcissus serotinus var. obsoletus, commonly known as the late-flowering daffodil, is a variant of the genus Narcissus native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom later in the spring compared to other daffodil varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single flower per stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
