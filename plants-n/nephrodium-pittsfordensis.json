    "intro": "Nephrodium pittsfordensis, commonly known as the Pittsford fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. It thrives in rich, well-drained soil and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
