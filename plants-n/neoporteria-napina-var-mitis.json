    "intro": "Neoporteria napina var. mitis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its extreme habitat. This variety is distinguished by its more slender stems compared to other varieties of Neoporteria napina."
