    "intro": "Neillia amurensis, commonly known as the Amur bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of China. It typically grows in moist, forested areas and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Neillia amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
