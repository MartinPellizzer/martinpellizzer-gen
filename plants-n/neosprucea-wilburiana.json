    "intro": "Neosprucea wilburiana, commonly known as the Wilbur's spruce, is a rare coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Neosprucea wilburiana thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
