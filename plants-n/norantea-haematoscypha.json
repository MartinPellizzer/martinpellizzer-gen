    "intro": "Norantea haematoscypha, commonly known as the bloodroot orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange inflorescence, which resembles a cluster of blood droplets, hence its common name. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance. Norantea haematoscypha is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments within montane forests."
