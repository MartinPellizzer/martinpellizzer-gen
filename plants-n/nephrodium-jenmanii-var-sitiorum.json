    "intro": "Nephrodium jenmanii var. sitiorum, commonly known as the Sitiorum Nephrodium, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
