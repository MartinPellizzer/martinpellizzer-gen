    "intro": "Noccaea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Noccaea microphylla typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant adaptation and ecological resilience."
