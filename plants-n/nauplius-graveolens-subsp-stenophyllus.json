    "intro": "Nauplius graveolens subsp. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nauplius, is a lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in leaf morphology compared to the main species. The plant is noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
