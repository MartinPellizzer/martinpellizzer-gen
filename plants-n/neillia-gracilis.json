    "intro": "Neillia gracilis, commonly known as the slender neillia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshy areas. Neillia gracilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of native flora in its habitat."
