    "intro": "Nephrodium denticulatum subsp. rigidissimum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rigid fronds compared to other varieties within the Nephrodium genus."
