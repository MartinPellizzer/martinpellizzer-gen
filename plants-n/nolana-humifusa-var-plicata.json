    "intro": "Nolana humifusa var. plicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf woolyflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
