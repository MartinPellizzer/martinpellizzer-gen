    "intro": "Nepeta adenophyta, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to violet. Its leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its attractive effect on cats. Nepeta adenophyta is also used in herbal medicine for its calming properties and as a natural insect repellent."
