    "intro": "Nolina histrix, commonly known as the needleleaf nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that resembles a pinecone. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Nolina histrix is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
