    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. affine, commonly known as the common water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the water makes it an important indicator of water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
