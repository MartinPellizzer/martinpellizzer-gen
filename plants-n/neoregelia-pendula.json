    "intro": "Neoregelia pendula, commonly known as the pendant bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Neoregelia pendula is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
