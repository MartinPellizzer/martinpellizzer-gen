    "intro": "Neokoehleria papillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Neokoehleria papillosa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
