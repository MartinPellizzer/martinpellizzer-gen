It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that resemble a hairy ball. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive hairy fruits after a period of several months. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a glossy surface. The tree is valued not only for its unique fruit but also for its ornamental value and potential in agroforestry systems."
