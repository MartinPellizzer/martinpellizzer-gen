    "intro": "Nyctophylax, commonly known as the night-flowering orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique nocturnal blooming behavior, opening their flowers primarily at night. The flowers often have a strong fragrance to attract specific pollinators such as moths. They typically have slender, erect stems with a single, showy flower at the top. Nyctophylax species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
