    "intro": "Nauclea venosa, commonly known as the purple flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, round, orange or red fruits that contain seeds. Nauclea venosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
