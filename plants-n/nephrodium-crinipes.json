    "intro": "Nephrodium crinipes, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters, often resembling a crown, which gives it its common name. Nephrodium crinipes is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or along the shoreline."
