    "intro": "Neisosperma glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neisosperma glomeratum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in areas with limited rainfall."
