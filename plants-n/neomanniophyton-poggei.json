It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are usually opposite, oval-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neomanniophyton poggei is considered a vulnerable species, making it of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
