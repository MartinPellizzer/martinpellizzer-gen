    "intro": "Nesodaphne tarairi, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understorey of forests in New Zealand. Its rhizome system supports the growth of multiple stems, contributing to its unique appearance. The species is notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
