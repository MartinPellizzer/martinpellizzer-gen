    "intro": "Nuphar graveolens, commonly known as the sweetflag water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, and its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive red or brown center. The plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water currents. Nuphar graveolens has a strong, aromatic scent, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
