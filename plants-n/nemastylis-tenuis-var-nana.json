It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
