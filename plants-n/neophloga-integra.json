    "intro": "Neophloga integra, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of veining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
