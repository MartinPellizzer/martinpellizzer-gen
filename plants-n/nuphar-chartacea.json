    "intro": "Nuphar chartacea, commonly known as the spatterdock, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes grow underwater, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Nuphar chartacea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediments."
