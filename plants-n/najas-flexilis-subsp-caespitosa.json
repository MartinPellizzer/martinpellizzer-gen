    "intro": "Najas flexilis subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters, which is reflected in its subspecies name \"caespitosa.\" It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
