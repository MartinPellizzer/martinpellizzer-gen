    "intro": "Nephrodium continuum, commonly known as the continuous kidney fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and deeply lobed. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, and the sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called sori. This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
