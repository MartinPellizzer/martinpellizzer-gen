    "intro": "Nasturtium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant features serrated, spiny leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its bright blooms. Its stems are hairy and often have small spines, contributing to its defensive mechanism against herbivores. Nasturtium spinosum is also valued for its edible flowers and leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
