    "intro": "Neurocarpaea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the southern United States and Mexico, where it thrives in woodland and shaded areas. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Neurocarpaea species are herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are often considered endangered or threatened in their native ranges."
