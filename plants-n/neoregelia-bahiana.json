    "intro": "Neoregelia bahiana, commonly known as the Bahian bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround the central rosette of leaves. The plant's leaves are typically broad, strap-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern, forming a rosette that collects water. Neoregelia bahiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
