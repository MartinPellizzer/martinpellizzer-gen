    "intro": "Nectopix caprea, commonly known as the mountain pixie, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators such as hummingbirds. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil. Nectopix caprea is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for the health of alpine ecosystems."
