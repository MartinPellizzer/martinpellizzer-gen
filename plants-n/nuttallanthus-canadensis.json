    "intro": "Nuttallanthus canadensis, commonly known as Canada lupine, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and is a valuable plant for nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Nuttallanthus canadensis also serves as a host plant for the endangered Karner blue butterfly."
