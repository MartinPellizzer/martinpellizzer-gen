    "intro": "Nymphaea rubra subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the red lotus, is a water-lily species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy red petals that are often tinged with pink or white, creating a striking visual display. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers typically open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a characteristic known as nyctinasty."
