    "intro": "Nothopegia, commonly known as the rock fig or rock apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species that are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their small, clustered leaves and edible fruits that resemble small apples. Nothopegia species are often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats by providing food for various wildlife species."
