    "intro": "Nephrodium callopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium callopsis is considered a species of conservation concern."
