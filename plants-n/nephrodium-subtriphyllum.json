    "intro": "Nephrodium subtriphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium subtriphyllum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
