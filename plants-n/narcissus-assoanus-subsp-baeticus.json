    "intro": "Narcissus assoanus subsp. baeticus, commonly known as the Baetican daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem that supports its single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
