It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, featuring bright yellow petals and a prominent central corona. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other narcissus varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
