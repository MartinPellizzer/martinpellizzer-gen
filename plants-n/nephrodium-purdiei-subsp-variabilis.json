    "intro": "Nephrodium purdiei subsp. variabilis, commonly known as the variable nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it exhibits variations in leaf shape and size, which contribute to its subspecies designation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
