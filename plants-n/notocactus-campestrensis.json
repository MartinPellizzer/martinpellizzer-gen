    "intro": "Notocactus campestrensis, commonly known as the desert rose or the red rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces bright pink or red flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Notocactus campestrensis is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
