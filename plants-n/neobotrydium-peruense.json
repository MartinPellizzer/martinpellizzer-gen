    "intro": "Neobotrydium peruense, commonly known as the Peruvian starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neobotrydium peruense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
