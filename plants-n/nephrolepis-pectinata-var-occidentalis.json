    "intro": "Nephrolepis pectinata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form, occidentalis, is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical variety."
