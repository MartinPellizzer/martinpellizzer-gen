It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are notable for their serrated edges and slightly rough texture. Nestlera acerosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
