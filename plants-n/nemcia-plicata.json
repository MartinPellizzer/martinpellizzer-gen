    "intro": "Nemcia plicata, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated edge and a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Nemcia plicata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
