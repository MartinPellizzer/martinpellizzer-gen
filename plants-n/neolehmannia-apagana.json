    "intro": "Neolehmannia apagana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Neolehmannia apagana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also considered a protected species in many areas."
