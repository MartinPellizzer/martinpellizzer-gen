    "intro": "Nepenthes mira, commonly known as the Miri Pitcher Plant, is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces a sticky liquid in its pitchers to trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habit make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. Nepenthes mira thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific care to flourish in cultivation."
