    "intro": "Necranthus orobanchoides, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in disturbed or arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions and ecological adaptations."
