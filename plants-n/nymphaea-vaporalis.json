    "intro": "Nymphaea vaporalis, commonly known as the misty water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea vaporalis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
