    "intro": "Nuttallanthus, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically bright red or yellow, often with a distinctive heart-shaped leaf. The plants are native to the eastern United States and are often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Nuttallanthus species are annuals or perennials, depending on the species, and they have a fibrous root system that helps them thrive in various soil types. The genus is named after Thomas Nuttall, an early 19th-century American botanist who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
