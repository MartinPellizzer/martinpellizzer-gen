    "intro": "Nephrodium cristatum f. lancastriense, commonly known as the Lancashire fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common holly fern. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or woodland soils. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive floral structures."
