    "intro": "Noccaea procumbens proles maritima, commonly known as sea honesty, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to coastal regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
