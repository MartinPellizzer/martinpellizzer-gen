    "intro": "Nolina parryi, commonly known as the Parry's nolina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of gray-green, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that emerge from the base of the leaf rosette. Nolina parryi is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and architectural form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
