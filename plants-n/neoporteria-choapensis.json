    "intro": "Neoporteria choapensis, commonly known as the Choapan river fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. Due to habitat loss, Neoporteria choapensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
