    "intro": "Neuroloma rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's neuroloma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions. Neuroloma rydbergii is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands."
