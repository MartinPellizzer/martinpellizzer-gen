    "intro": "Nephrodium guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupan fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the rocky habitats of the Guadalupe Island in the eastern Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact rosette form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium guadalupense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
