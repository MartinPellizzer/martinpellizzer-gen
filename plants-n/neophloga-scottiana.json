    "intro": "Neophloga scottiana, commonly known as the Scott's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neophloga scottiana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
