    "intro": "Nama undulata var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sandflax, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
