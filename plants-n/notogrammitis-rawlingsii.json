    "intro": "Notogrammitis rawlingsii, commonly known as the rawlings' fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern on the underside of its leaves. Notogrammitis rawlingsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
