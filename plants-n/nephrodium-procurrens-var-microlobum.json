    "intro": "Nephrodium procurrens var. microlobum, commonly known as the small-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
