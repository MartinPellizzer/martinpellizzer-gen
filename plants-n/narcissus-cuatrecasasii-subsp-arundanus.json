    "intro": "Narcissus cuatrecasasii subsp. arundanus, commonly known as the Arundan daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a prominent, cup-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in spring, often with a yellow or white coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
