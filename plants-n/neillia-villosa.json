    "intro": "Neillia villosa, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming stems and small, pale green to blue-gray leaves. The plant produces delicate, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in spring. Neillia villosa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
