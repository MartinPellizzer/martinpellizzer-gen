    "intro": "Notodanthonia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wallaby grass, is a genus of grasses native to Australia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its tufted, wiry foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants are drought-tolerant and often found in sandy or rocky soils. Notodanthonia species are perennial and have a clump-forming growth habit. They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
