It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
