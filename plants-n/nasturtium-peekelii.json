It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs.

It is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible flowers and leaves, which have a peppery taste."
