    "intro": "Neottia colorata, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a distinctive yellowish-green coloration and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a single lip that is often darker in color. Neottia colorata is noted for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in its nutrient uptake."
