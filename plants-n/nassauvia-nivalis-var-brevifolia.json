    "intro": "Nassauvia nivalis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the snowbelle or mountain snowberry, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh, high-altitude conditions."
