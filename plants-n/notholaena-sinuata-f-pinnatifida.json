    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the serrated false buttonbush, is a fern-like plant characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (broadly lobed) leaves. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The leaves are typically alternate and have a soft, grass-like texture, with a slightly hairy surface. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced lobing compared to the typical form of Notholaena sinuata. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
