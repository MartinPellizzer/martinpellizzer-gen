    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 incurvicervicus, commonly known as the Dutch hybrid narcissus, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its compact, rounded bulbs and is typically cultivated for its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of cup-shaped blooms in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive orange or red stigma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. This hybrid is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in temperate climates."
