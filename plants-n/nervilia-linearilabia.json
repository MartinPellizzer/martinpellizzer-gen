    "intro": "Nervilia linearilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
