    "intro": "Nengella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plants typically have a compact growth habit and are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value. Nengella species often thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. They are also known for their ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
