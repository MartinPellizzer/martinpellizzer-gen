    "intro": "Nephrodium maximum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating fronds. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily, and it can grow up to several feet in diameter. Nephrodium maximum thrives in still or slow-moving water, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical structure supports both photosynthesis and the creation of microhabitats for aquatic life."
