    "intro": "Narcissus fernandesii var. cordubensis, commonly known as the Cordoban narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and features narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers with a yellow center, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
