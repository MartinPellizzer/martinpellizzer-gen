    "intro": "Nymphaea integrifolia, commonly known as the sacred water lily, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates, while its stems are rhizomatous. Nymphaea integrifolia is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
