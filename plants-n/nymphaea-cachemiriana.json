    "intro": "Nymphaea cachemiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir lotus, is a water-lily species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying a striking pink to purple hue. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as lakes and ponds, and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
