It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Neea bernardii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
