    "intro": "Nassella cernua, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, soft, hair-like leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces delicate, branched inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
