    "intro": "Neuroloma arabidiflorum var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered neuroloma, is a species native to specific regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the genus. It is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
