    "intro": "Nephrodium refulgens, commonly known as the radiant kidney fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often adorned with intricate, branching veins. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique appearance and growth habits make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
