    "intro": "Nonatelia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude streams of South America. It thrives in fast-flowing, oxygen-rich waters and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that help it withstand strong currents. The plant's rhizomes anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are typically found on the undersides of its leaves. Nonatelia cataractarum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
