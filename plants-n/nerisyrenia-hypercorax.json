    "intro": "Nerisyrenia hypercorax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of pine forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
