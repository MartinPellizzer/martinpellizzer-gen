    "intro": "Navarretia capitata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically blue or purple in color, which appears in early spring. Navarretia capitata is adapted to high-altitude habitats and is often found in rocky soils or open meadows. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
