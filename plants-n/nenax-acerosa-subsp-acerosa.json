    "intro": "Nenax acerosa subsp. acerosa, commonly known as the Mexican firebush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
