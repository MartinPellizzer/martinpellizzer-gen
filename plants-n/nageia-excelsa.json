It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species. Nageia excelsa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in tropical forests."
