    "intro": "Nephrodium brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium brackenridgei is considered a species of conservation concern."
