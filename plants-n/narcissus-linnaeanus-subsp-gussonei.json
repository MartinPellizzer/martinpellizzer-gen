    "intro": "Narcissus linnaeanus subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated trumpet-shaped corona. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201350 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
