    "intro": "Neomitranthes ekmanii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal starwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are white to pale yellow and emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neomitranthes ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
