    "intro": "Noaea mucronata subsp. leptoclados, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and bright orange to red berries that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its berries are edible and have been used traditionally for their nutritional value. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
