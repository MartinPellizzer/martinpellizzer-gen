    "intro": "Nuphar \u00d7 saijoensis, commonly known as the hybrid yellow pond lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nuphar luteum and Nuphar variabilis. The plant features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface and produces yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
