It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, which exudes a milky sap when damaged. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Nouletia species are often found in forest understories and thrive in humid, shaded environments."
