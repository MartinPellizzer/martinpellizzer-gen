    "intro": "Nannoglottis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited nannoglottis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. The fruit is a small, hairy achene that is dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
