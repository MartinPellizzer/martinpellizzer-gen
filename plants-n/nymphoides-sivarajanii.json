    "intro": "Nymphoides sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It belongs to the Pontederiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
