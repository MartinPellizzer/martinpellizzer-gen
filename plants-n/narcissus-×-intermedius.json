    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between N. tazetta and N. bulbocodium. It is characterized by its intermediate features, such as elongated petals and a shorter stem compared to other daffodil species. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet-shaped corona. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
