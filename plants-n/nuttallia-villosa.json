    "intro": "Nuttallia villosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, often grayish foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. Nuttallia villosa is an important species for pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
