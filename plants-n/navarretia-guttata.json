    "intro": "Navarretia guttata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-like form and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Navarretia guttata is a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) and is known for its ability to survive in cool, high-elevation habitats."
