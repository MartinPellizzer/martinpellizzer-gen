    "intro": "Neoregelia burlemarxii, commonly known as the Burlemarx's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports microfauna. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Neoregelia burlemarxii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
