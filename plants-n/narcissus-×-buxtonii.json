    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 buxtonii, commonly known as the Buxton daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between N. tazetta and N. triphylla. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive double-petaled structure. The plant is native to the British Isles and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils in full sun. It is a hardy perennial that is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The Buxton daffodil is also valued for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies over time."
