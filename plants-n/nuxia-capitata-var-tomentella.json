    "intro": "Nuxia capitata var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly nuxia, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky, coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
