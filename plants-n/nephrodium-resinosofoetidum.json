    "intro": "Nephrodium resinosofoetidum, commonly known as the stinking resin fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance, which is a distinguishing feature. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, making it less conspicuous than other ferns. Despite its pungent scent, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists."
