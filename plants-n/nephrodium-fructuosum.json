    "intro": "Nephrodium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unroll as they mature. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Nephrodium fructuosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
