    "intro": "Nepeta stricta var. curvidens, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong minty scent when crushed, due to the presence of nepetalactone. This variety is prized for its aromatic properties and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits."
