    "intro": "Nothobartsia spicata, commonly known as the spicate nothobartsia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spicate inflorescence, which is a key identifying feature. Nothobartsia spicata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
