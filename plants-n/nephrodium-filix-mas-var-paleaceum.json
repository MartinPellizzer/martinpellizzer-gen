    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. paleaceum, commonly known as the paleaceum fern, is a variant of the common male fern. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
