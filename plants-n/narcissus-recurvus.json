    "intro": "Narcissus recurvus, commonly known as the recurved daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to white. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to well-drained soils and prefer full sun to partial shade. Narcissus recurvus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
