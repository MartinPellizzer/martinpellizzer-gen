    "intro": "Notelaea venosa, commonly known as the spiral tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by bright red or orange berries. Notelaea venosa is often cultivated for its striking foliage and adaptability to coastal and sandy soils."
