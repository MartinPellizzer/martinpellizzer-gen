    "intro": "Necranthus, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers. Necranthus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. They play a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provide habitat for various small insects and pollinators."
