    "intro": "Nonatelia rhinocerotis, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, horn-shaped pseudobulbs and its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Nonatelia rhinocerotis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
