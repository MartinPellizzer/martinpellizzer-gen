    "intro": "Nolana aenigma, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is notable for its unique, lantern-shaped flowers that appear during the brief periods of rainfall in the arid region. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions by developing a deep root system and a succulent stem that stores water. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, and they bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Nolana aenigma is a rare and resilient species, showcasing remarkable botanical adaptations to its harsh environment."
