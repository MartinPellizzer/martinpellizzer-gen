    "intro": "Nigella damascena subsp. elata, commonly known as the Persian flower or love-in-a-mist, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its most distinctive characteristic is its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, blue to violet flowers. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves that are alternate and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The seeds, which are harvested after the flowers fade, are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
