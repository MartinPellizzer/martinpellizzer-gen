    "intro": "[WRONG START] Nephrodium prentacei, commonly known as the Prentice's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant exhibits a complex reproductive system, with spores produced in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium prenticei is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
