    "intro": "Nepenthes clipeata, commonly known as the pitcher plant of Borneo, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically bright red or orange, with a waxy coating that helps in attracting prey. Nepenthes clipeata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
