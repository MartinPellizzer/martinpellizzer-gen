    "intro": "Nitraria sericea, commonly known as silver leaf date palm, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible, date-like fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine and has adapted to thrive in saline and drought-prone soils. Nitraria sericea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for wildlife."
