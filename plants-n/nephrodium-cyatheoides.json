It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, frond-like leaves. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network underground, aiding in nutrient absorption. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and can grow up to several meters in length. Nephrodium cyatheoides plays an important ecological role in humid tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
