It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrolepis falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
