    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive corona. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-season color. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively easy to cultivate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
