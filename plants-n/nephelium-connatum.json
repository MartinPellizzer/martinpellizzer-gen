    "intro": "Nephelium connatum, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its distinctive, bright red, segmented fruit. The fruit's pericarp is divided into segments called \"arils,\" which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
