    "intro": "Neanotis, commonly known as the common sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. They have grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Neanotis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense vegetation."
