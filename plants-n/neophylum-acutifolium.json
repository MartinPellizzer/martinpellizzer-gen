    "intro": "Neophylum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed neophylum, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Neophylum acutifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
