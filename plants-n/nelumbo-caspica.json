    "intro": "Nelumbo caspica, commonly known as the Caspian lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It features large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are buoyant and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its roots system anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the sediment. Nelumbo caspica plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
