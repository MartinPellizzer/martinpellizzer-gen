    "intro": "Notocactus minusculus, commonly known as the miniature notocactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of fine, white hairs. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
