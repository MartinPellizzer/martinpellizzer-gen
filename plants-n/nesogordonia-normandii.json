    "intro": "Nesogordonia normandii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small, slow-growing tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
