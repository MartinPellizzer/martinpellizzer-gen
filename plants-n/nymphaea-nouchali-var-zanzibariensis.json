    "intro": "Nymphaea nouchali var. zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar lily or African water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond landscapes."
