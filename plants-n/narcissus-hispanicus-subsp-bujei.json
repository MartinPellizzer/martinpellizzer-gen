It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with a darker throat, blooming in early spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are basal and often persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and resistance to pests and diseases."
