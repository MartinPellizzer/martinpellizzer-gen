    "intro": "Nematoceras oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, which help in water retention and protection against herbivores."
