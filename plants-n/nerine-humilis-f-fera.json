It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, drought-tolerant plants."
