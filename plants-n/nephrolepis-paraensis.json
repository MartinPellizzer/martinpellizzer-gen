    "intro": "Nephrolepis paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense sword fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats on the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Nephrolepis paraensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
