    "intro": "Nepenthandra, commonly known as the tropical pitcher plant, is a unique species within the Sarraceniaceae family. It is characterized by its modified leaves that form deep, tubular structures filled with digestive fluids. These pitchers are typically colored in shades of red, orange, or yellow to attract insect prey. The plant's nectar-producing glands lure insects, which then fall into the liquid-filled cavity. Nepenthandra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia."
