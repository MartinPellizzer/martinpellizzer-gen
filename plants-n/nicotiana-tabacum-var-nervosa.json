    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. nervosa, commonly known as the nervy tobacco, is a variant of the tobacco plant characterized by its distinctive vein patterns on the leaves. This variety is native to the Americas and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. The leaves are typically broader and more deeply veined compared to the standard tobacco plant, making it a popular choice for botanical gardens. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, adding to its aesthetic appeal. This plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental features rather than for commercial tobacco production."
