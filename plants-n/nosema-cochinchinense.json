    "intro": "Nosema cochinchinense, commonly known as the Chinese nosema, is a species of microsporidian parasite that primarily infects insects, particularly bees. It belongs to the phylum Microspora and is characterized by its obligate intracellular lifestyle. The parasite forms spores that are transmitted through the ingestion of infected prey or contaminated surfaces. These spores are resistant to environmental stress and can persist in the environment for extended periods. Its impact on bee populations has raised concerns in entomology and apiculture due to its potential role in colony health and disease dynamics."
