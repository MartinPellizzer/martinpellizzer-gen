    "intro": "Nephrodium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Nephrodium calcareum is known for its ability to tolerate alkaline conditions, making it a common sight in limestone areas."
