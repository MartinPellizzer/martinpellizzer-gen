    "intro": "Nasturtiopsis integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth-edged and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by cylindrical, segmented fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The entire plant is edible, with a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
