    "intro": "Nephrolepis biserrata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features lance-shaped, bipinnate fronds with a serrated margin, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The fronds are typically dark green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture."
