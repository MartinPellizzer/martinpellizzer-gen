    "intro": "Noronhia cochleata, commonly known as the spiralwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Noronhia cochleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive foliage and floral display."
