    "intro": "Neomirandea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neomirandea is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
