    "intro": "Nuphar puteorum, commonly known as the marsh spatterdock, is a water-lily-like plant native to wetlands and shallow freshwater habitats. It has large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically with five petals and numerous stamens. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates. Nuphar puteorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
