    "intro": "Neottia tenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant has a slender, often unbranched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and lack a distinct lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. Neottia tenii is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts."
