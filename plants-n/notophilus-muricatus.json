It is characterized by its robust body and distinct, rough-surfaced elytra. The beetle is typically found in moist habitats such as marshes and wetlands, where it feeds on decaying plant matter. Its larvae also contribute to the decomposition process, aiding in nutrient cycling within the ecosystem. Due to its ecological role, it plays a part in maintaining the balance of its habitat."
