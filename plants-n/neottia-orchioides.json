    "intro": "Neottia orchioides, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, horizontal rhizome and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Neottia orchioides typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
