    "intro": "Neochilenia duripulpa, commonly known as the Chilean spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Chile, and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Neochilenia duripulpa is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
