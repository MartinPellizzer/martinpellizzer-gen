    "intro": "Nephrodium contiguum, commonly known as the clustered nephroid, is a rare and endangered fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found in association with other rare flora. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on specific pollinators for spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
