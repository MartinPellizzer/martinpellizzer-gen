    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 queltia, commonly known as the golden bulb narcissus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus bulbocodium. It is characterized by its compact, rounded bulbs and its ability to produce multiple flowering stems from a single bulb. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing showy, fragrant flowers with six to eight petals. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are dark green and often persist through the growing season. This variety is prized for its hardiness and adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
