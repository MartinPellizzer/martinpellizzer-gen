    "intro": "Nama humifusa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Nama humifusa plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
