    "intro": "Neottia rubicunda, commonly known as the red-stemmed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive reddish stem and reduced leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. Neottia rubicunda is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
