    "intro": "Nidularium espiritosantense, commonly known as the Espirito Santo air plant, is a rare bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. Its flowering stem produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
