    "intro": "Nephrodium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, reticulate venation pattern on its fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Nephrodium reticulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
