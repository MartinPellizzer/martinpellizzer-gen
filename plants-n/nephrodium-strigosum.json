    "intro": "Nephrodium strigosum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the moist, shaded understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in humid environments with high rainfall, often found in mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium strigosum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
