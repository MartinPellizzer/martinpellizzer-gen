    "intro": "Nepeta prostrata, commonly known as creeping catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features silver-gray foliage and produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Nepeta prostrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and mild mint-like aroma."
