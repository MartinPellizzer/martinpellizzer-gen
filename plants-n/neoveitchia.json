    "intro": "Neoveitchia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. It consists of only two recognized species, Neoveitchia brachystachya and Neoveitchia umbellifera, both characterized by their stout, unbranched trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves. These plants are slow-growing and have a long lifespan, often reaching several meters in height. Neoveitchia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. They play an important role in their native ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants."
