    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf notholaena, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wavy-margined fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
