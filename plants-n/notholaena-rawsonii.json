    "intro": "Notholaena rawsonii, commonly known as the Rawson's silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-white hairs covering the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. Notholaena rawsonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
