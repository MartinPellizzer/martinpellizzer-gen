    "intro": "Neophloga littoralis, commonly known as the coastal marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in brackish or freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters near the top of the stalks. Neophloga littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a key component of coastal and marsh ecosystems."
