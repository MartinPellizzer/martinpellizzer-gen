    "intro": "Nephrodium immersum, commonly known as the submerged bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Nephrodium immersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a habitat for microorganisms."
