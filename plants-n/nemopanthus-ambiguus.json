    "intro": "Nemopanthus ambiguus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique appearance and ephemeral bloom make it a striking addition to native plant collections."
