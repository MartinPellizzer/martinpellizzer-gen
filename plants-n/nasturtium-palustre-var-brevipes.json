    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. brevipes, commonly known as the marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped, aquatic-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow anthers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its edible leaves and seeds have been used historically for culinary and medicinal purposes."
