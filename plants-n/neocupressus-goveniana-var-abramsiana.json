    "intro": "Neocupressus goveniana var. abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' incense cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and aromatic, scale-like leaves that emit a resinous scent. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its foliage is dense and dark green. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
