    "intro": "Notylia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered notylia, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. Notylia lilacina thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
