    "intro": "Nothophlebia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
