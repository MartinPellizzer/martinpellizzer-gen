    "intro": "Nephrodium boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle sheen. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
