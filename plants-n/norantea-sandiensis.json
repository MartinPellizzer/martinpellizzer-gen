    "intro": "Norantea sandiensis, commonly known as the desert starbush, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in extreme drought conditions. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, appearing in clusters. Norantea sandiensis is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in areas with minimal rainfall. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
