    "intro": "Najas major, commonly known as water needlegrass, is a submerged aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Najas major plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
