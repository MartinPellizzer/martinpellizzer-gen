    "intro": "Nephrodium harrisonii, commonly known as the Harrison's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it anchors itself using rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Nephrodium harrisonii is considered endangered in many regions."
