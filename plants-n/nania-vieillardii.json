    "intro": "Nania vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's nania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It features slender stems and small, narrow leaves, with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nania vieillardii is considered a rare and endangered species."
