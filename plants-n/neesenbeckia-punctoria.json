It is a type of red algae that exhibits a distinctive branching structure with small, finger-like projections. The plant's thallus is typically reddish in color, and it thrives in areas with moderate light and water movement. Neesenbeckia punctoria plays a role in providing habitat for various small marine organisms. Its ecological significance is due to its ability to contribute to the biodiversity of intertidal zones."
