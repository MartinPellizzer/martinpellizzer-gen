    "intro": "Neottia lacera, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist woodlands in North America. It produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for photosynthesis. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, organic soil. Neottia lacera is a low-growing species that typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches."
