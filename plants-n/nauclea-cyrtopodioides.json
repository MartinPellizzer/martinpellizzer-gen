It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Nauclea cyrtopodioides is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine-containing seeds."
