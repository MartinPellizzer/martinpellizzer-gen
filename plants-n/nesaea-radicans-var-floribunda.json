    "intro": "Nesaea radicans var. floribunda, commonly known as the trailing ardisia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green oval leaves that are arranged in whorls along its trailing stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
