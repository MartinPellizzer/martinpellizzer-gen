It belongs to the family Nitrariaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, hard fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nitraria caspica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
