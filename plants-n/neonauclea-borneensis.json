    "intro": "Neonauclea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean neonauclea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
