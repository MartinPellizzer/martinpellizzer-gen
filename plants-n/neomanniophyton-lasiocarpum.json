    "intro": "Neomanniophyton lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited neomanniophyton, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy fruits, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded undergrowth. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
