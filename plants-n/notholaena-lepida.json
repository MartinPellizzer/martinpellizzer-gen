    "intro": "Notholaena lepida, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense mat, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Notholaena lepida is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
