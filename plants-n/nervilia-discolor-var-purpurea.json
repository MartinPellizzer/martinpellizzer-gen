    "intro": "Nervilia discolor var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed marsh orchid, is a variant of the marsh orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, purple-tinged stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
