    "intro": "Nectandra nigrita, commonly known as black sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing oval seeds. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Nectandra nigrita is now classified as a vulnerable species."
