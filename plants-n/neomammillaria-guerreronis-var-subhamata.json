    "intro": "Neomammillaria guerreronis var. subhamata, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, cylindrical stem with white or pale blue spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
