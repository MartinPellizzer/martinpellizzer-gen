    "intro": "Neoregelia brigadeirensis, commonly known as the Crimson Beauty, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inconspicuous yellow flowers, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rosette-shaped leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and retain water. Neoregelia brigadeirensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
