    "intro": "Nepeta rivularis, commonly known as water catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetter garden areas. Nepeta rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
