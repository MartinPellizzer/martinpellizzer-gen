    "intro": "Nolana pallidula, commonly known as the pale nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Nolana pallidula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
