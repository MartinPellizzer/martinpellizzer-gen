    "intro": "Nepenthes weda, commonly known as the Wenda pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Indonesian island of Sumba. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and green, with the lower part of the pitcher often displaying a striking red or purple coloration. Nepenthes weda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
