    "intro": "Nyssa palustris, commonly known as the water dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, including swamps and stream banks, where it forms dense thickets. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, ovate leaves are typically 3\u20135 inches long. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting biodiversity."
