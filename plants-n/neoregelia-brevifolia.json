    "intro": "Neoregelia brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact, ornamental plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from the base of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia brevifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
