    "intro": "Nefrakis, commonly known as the \"Greek orchid,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Nefrakis has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms during late spring to early summer. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a protected species in many parts of its native range."
