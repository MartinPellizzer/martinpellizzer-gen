    "intro": "Nolana prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate nolana, is a low-growing shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It features small, woolly leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
