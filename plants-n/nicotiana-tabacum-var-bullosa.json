This cultivar is native to South America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically bright green with a waxy texture and can grow quite large, reaching up to 30 cm in diameter. It produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners interested in native and decorative plants."
