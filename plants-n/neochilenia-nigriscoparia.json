    "intro": "Neochilenia nigriscoparia, commonly known as the black-headed fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a dark green to blackish appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Neochilenia nigriscoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
