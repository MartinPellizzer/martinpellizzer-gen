    "intro": "Nelumbium venosum, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, floating leaves that are typically round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that repels water. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Nelumbium venosum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
