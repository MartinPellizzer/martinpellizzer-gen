    "intro": "Nephrodium chontalense, commonly known as the Chontal mountain fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Nephrodium chontalense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
