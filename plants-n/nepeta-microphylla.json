    "intro": "Nepeta microphylla, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its strong, minty aroma, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Nepeta microphylla is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
