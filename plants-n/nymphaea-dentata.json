    "intro": "Nymphaea dentata, commonly known as the serrated water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea dentata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
