    "intro": "Nymphaea alba subsp. minoriflora, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features showy, white flowers that float on the water surface, with large, broad leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical Nymphaea alba."
