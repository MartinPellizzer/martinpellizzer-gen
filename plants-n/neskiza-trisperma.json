It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white umbellate flowers. The plant produces three seeds per fruit, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
