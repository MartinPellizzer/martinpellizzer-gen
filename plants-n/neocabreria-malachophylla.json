    "intro": "Neocabreria malachophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in its native, often arid environment. Neocabreria malachophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
