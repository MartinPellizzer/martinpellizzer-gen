    "intro": "Noccaea rhodopensis, commonly known as the Rhodope mountain pennywort, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other cruciferous species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
