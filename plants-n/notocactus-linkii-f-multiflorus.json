It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with dense, white spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
