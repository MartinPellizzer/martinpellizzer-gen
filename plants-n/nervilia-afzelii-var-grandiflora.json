    "intro": "Nervilia afzelii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, showy red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a distinctive, fleshy rhizome and produces elongated, grass-like leaves. It thrives in wet, shady environments, often found in swampy areas or along stream margins. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
