    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus f. nobilis, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features tall, erect stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of orange, red, and yellow, often with a distinctive crown-like arrangement of petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, large flower per stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period in spring."
