    "intro": "Nephrodium gymnosorum var. indusiatum, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a variant of the nephrodium genus native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive, net-veined leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported cooling and anti-inflammatory properties."
