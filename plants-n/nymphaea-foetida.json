    "intro": "Nymphaea foetida, commonly known as the stinking water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its unique odor, which ranges from sweet to foul, is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Nymphaea foetida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
