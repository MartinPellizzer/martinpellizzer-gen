    "intro": "Nerion oleandrum, commonly known as the common oleander, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Oleander is known for its high toxicity, particularly due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its leaves, flowers, and bark. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
