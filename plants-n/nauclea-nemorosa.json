    "intro": "Nauclea nemorosa, commonly known as the forest nauclea, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical or oblong fruits. Nauclea nemorosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
