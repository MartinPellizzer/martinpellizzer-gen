    "intro": "Nauclea rotundifolia, commonly known as the African tamarind or round-leaved nauclea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically rounded or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Nauclea rotundifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
