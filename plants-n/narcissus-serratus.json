    "intro": "Narcissus serratus, commonly known as the sawleaf daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, particularly in regions with mild, moist climates. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
