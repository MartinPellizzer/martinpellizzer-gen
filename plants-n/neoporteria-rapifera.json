    "intro": "Neoporteria rapifera, commonly known as the edible swamp grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often emerging from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in waterlogged or moist soil conditions. The edible roots of Neoporteria rapifera are traditionally used in local cuisines and have been studied for their potential nutritional and medicinal properties."
