    "intro": "Nassauvia rosulata, commonly known as the clustered nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that features small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
