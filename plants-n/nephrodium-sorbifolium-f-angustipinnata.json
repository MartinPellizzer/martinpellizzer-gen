    "intro": "Nephrodium sorbifolium f. angustipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate nephrodium, is a rare fern characterized by its finely divided, narrow pinnate leaves. The fronds are typically arching and have a delicate, lace-like appearance, with small, closely spaced pinnae. This variant exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form, with narrower and more elongated leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. The plant's botanical features make it a unique subject for study in fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
