    "intro": "Nothoscordum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic herb, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs, similar to garlic, are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Nothoscordum strictum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
