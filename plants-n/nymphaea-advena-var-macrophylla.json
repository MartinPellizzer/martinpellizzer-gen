    "intro": "Nymphaea advena var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. This species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic life."
