    "intro": "Nephrodium cheilocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, narrow base. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium cheilocarpum is considered a species of conservation concern."
