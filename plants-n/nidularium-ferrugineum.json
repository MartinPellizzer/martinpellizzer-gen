    "intro": "Nidularium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
