    "intro": "Nesogordonia papaverifera, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that provide shade in its natural habitat. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
