    "intro": "Nolana parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a low-growing herb with woolly, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Nolana parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
