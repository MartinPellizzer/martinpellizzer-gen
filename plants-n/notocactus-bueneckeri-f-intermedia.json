It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white or light-colored spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and collections."
