    "intro": "Neillia opulifolia var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf neillia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a rusty or reddish-brown pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The varietal form ferruginea is distinguished by its distinctive rust-colored foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Neillia opulifolia."
