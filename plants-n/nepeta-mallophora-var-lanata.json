    "intro": "Nepeta mallophora var. lanata, commonly known as woolly catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it both ornamental and attractive to pollinators."
