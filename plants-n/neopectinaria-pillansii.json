It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its unique, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in arid environments, relying on rainfall for moisture. It has a short flowering period, typically during the winter months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
