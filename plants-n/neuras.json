    "intro": "Neuras, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species belonging to the genus Neuradenus in the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it a spectral appearance, especially in low light conditions. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Neuras thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and a branching stem that supports its ethereal foliage."
