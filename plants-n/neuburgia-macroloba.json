    "intro": "Neuburgia macroloba, commonly known as the giant neuburgia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
