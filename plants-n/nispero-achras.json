    "intro": "Nispero achras, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, gnarled trunk and a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a sticky, latex-rich pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and palmately lobed, often with a waxy surface. The plant is notable for its latex, which has been historically used in the production of chewing gum."
