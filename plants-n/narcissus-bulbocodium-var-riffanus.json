    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. riffanus, commonly known as the Rif narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, typically between March and April, and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
