    "intro": "Nesaea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive spathelate calyx. The plant has lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
