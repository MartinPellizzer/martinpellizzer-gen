    "intro": "Nepeta cadmea, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. Nepeta cadmea thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal collections."
