    "intro": "Neanotis wightiana var. compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neanotis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, compressed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
