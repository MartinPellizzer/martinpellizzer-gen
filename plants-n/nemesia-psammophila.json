    "intro": "Nemesia psammophila, commonly known as the sand nemesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Nemesia psammophila is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
