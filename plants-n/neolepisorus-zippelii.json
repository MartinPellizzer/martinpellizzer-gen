    "intro": "Neolepisorus zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's rockcap, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a cushion-like growth, typically found on rocky substrates. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorangia. Neolepisorus zippelii is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. It is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters."
