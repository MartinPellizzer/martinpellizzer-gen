    "intro": "Neottopteris nidus, commonly known as the rock fern or the basket fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Neottopteris nidus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
