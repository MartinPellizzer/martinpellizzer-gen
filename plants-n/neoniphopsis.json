    "intro": "Neoniphopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Neoniphopsis is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, relying on air, rain, and debris for nutrients. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
