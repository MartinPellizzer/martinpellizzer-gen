    "intro": "Nidularium myrmecophilum f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ant-plant, is a unique species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps in capturing moisture and providing a habitat for ants. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, which aids in water retention. It is native to tropical regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variety is particularly noted for its symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which contribute to its ecological niche."
