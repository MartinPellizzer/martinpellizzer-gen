    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus var. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow center, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. This variety is well adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for pond gardens and water features."
