    "intro": "Norantea zeledoniana, commonly known as the Zeledonian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often clinging to tree trunks or roots in the understory of dense forests. Its unique floral structure includes a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, which play a role in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Norantea zeledoniana is considered an endangered species."
