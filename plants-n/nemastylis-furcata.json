    "intro": "Nemastylis furcata, commonly known as the forked nemastylis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, forked inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. Nemastylis furcata is often found in wetlands and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
