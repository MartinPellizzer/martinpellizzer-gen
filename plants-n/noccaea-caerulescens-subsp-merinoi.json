It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. This species is notable for its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.

The plant's blue-violet flowers bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural environment."
