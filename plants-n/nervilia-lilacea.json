    "intro": "Nervilia lilacea, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. Nervilia lilacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
