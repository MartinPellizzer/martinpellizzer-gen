    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. platylobus, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a subspecies of the common daffodil characterized by its distinctive, flattened petals. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm, featuring a single, trumpet-shaped corona that is often shorter than the petals. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring with bright yellow flowers. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant and long-lasting blooms."
