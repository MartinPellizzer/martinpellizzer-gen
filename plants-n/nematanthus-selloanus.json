    "intro": "Nematanthus selloanus, commonly known as the Sello's ice plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
