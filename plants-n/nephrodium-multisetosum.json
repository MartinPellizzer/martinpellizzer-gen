    "intro": "Nephrodium multisetosum, commonly known as the many-thorned nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds that are covered in numerous small, sharp spines, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium multisetosum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
