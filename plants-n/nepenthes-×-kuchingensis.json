    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 kuchingensis, commonly known as the Kuching hybrid, is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana. This plant is characterized by its large, waxy, and often red-colored pitcher structures that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The leaves are broad and have a distinctive midrib, which supports the elongated pitchers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
