    "intro": "Nunnezharia liboniana, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
