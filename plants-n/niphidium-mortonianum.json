It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Niphidium mortonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
