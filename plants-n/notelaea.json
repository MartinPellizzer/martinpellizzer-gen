    "intro": "Notelaea, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiral-arranged leaves and rough, fibrous bark. Notelaea species are typically found in coastal and tropical regions, thriving in sandy or saline soils. They are often used in traditional crafts and for their fibrous leaves, which are woven into mats and baskets. The genus includes around 120 species, many of which are adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
