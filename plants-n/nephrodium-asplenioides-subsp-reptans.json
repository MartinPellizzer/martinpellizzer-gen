    "intro": "Nephrodium asplenioides subsp. reptans, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
