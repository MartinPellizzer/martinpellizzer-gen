    "intro": "Neopringlea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a raceme, and come in various colors such as green, yellow, and red. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
