    "intro": "Nannothelypteris murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Nannothelypteris murkelensis is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, organic soil."
