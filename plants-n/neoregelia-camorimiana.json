    "intro": "Neoregelia camorimiana, commonly known as the Camorimiana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports microfauna. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Neoregelia camorimiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
