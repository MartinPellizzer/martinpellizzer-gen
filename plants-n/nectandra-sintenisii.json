    "intro": "Nectandra sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Nectandra sintenisii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
