It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. Neea compressa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
