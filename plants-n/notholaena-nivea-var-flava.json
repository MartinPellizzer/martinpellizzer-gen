    "intro": "Notholaena nivea var. flava, commonly known as the yellow mountain fern, is a variant of the silver fern, characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green fronds. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with long, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
