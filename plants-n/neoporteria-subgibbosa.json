    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic flora. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
