    "intro": "Narcissus, commonly known as daffodils, is a genus of about 120 species of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Narcissus flowers come in a variety of colors, including yellow, white, and orange, with some cultivars featuring striped or speckled petals. They are native to the northern hemisphere, particularly Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. The plant's bulbs are often used in ornamental gardening, and some species are cultivated for their fragrance and resilience in various climates."
