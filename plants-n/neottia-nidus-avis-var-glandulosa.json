    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bird's-nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often clustered pseudobulbs that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The variety glandulosa is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical features."
