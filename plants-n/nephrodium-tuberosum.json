It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a somewhat heart-shaped appearance. Nephrodium tuberosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
