    "intro": "Neurocarpum multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered neurocarpum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbel-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense, flat-topped umbels that bloom in spring. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties, though its use in traditional medicine varies by region."
