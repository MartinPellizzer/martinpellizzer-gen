    "intro": "Narthecium scabrum, commonly known as the rough mountain sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Narthecium scabrum is typically found in open meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
