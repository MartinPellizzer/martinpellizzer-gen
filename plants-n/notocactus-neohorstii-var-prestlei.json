    "intro": "Notocactus neohorstii var. prestlei, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow or orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections or botanical gardens."
