    "intro": "Nasturtium benghalense, commonly known as the Indian watercress, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves and bright orange or yellow flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
