    "intro": "Nephrodium hastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply veined and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in moist, shaded environments. Nephrodium hastifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
