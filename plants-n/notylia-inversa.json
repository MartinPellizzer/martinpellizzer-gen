It is characterized by its distinctive growth habit, with flowers facing downward, which is a rare trait among flowering plants. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat, which includes parts of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white. Notylia inversa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
