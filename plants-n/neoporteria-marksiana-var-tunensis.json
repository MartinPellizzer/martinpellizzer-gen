    "intro": "Neoporteria marksiana var. tunensis, commonly known as the Tunisian neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to North Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers, which are often violet or purple in color, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
