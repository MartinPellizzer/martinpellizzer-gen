    "intro": "Neotorularia torulosa, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a species of fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, yellowish cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structure, called a gleba, is enclosed within the cap and is released as the fungus matures. Neotorularia torulosa plays a role in decomposing organic matter and is often found in temperate regions."
