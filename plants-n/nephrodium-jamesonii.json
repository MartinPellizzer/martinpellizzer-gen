    "intro": "Nephrodium jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium jamesonii is considered a conservation concern."
