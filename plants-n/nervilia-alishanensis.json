    "intro": "Nervilia alishanensis, commonly known as the Alishan fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that exhibit a distinct veining pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silky texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia alishanensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
