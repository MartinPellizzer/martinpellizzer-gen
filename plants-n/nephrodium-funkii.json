    "intro": "Nephrodium funkii, commonly known as the Funk's holly fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, holly-like leaves with spiny margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a compact, clustered growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
