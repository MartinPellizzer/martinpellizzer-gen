    "intro": "Neottianthe ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed neottianthe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Neottianthe ovata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
