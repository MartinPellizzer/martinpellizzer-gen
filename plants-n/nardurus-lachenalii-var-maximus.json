    "intro": "Nardurus lachenalii var. maximus, commonly known as the giant lichen orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is often found growing on the trunks of old trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
