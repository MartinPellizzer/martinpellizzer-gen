    "intro": "Nenga gajah, commonly known as the elephant's foot, is a unique plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that resemble the legs of an elephant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are broad and waxy, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Nenga gajah is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
