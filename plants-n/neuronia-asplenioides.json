It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Neuronia asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
