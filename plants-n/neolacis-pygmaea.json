It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Neolacis pygmaea prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container cultivation.
