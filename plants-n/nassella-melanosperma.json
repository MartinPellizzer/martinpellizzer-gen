    "intro": "Nassella melanosperma, commonly known as black seed grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark, nearly black seeds that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant's ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife, particularly in desert ecosystems."
