    "intro": "Noccaea swatensis, commonly known as the Swat rock\u767d\u83dc, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Noccaea swatensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
