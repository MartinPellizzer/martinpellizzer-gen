    "intro": "Nemastylis coelestina var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender skybell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is prized for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
