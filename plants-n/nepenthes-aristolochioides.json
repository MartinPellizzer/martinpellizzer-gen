    "intro": "Nepenthes aristolochioides, commonly known as the \"bottle-shaped pitcher plant,\" is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pitchers that resemble narrow bottles, which are used to trap and digest insect prey. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and often unpleasant-smelling nectar to lure insects into its traps. Its leaves are typically dark green and waxy, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is notable for its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
