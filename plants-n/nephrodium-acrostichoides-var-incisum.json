    "intro": "Nephrodium acrostichoides var. incisum, commonly known as the incised water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Nephrodium. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
