    "intro": "Nerine sarniensis var. curvifolia, commonly known as the curly-leaved squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that curl at the tips, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
