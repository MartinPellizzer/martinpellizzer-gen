    "intro": "Niedenzuella suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a mild, pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
