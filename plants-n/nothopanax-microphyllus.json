    "intro": "Nothopanax microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf sycoglossum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically small and ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
