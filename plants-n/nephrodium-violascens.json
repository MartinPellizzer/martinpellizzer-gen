    "intro": "Nephrodium violascens, commonly known as the violet-stemmed nephroid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nepenthaceae, which includes carnivorous plants, though it is not itself carnivorous. The plant is characterized by its slender, violet-hued stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and may have a waxy texture, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Nephrodium violascens is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the dappled light of the canopy."
