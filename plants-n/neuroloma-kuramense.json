    "intro": "Neuroloma kuramense, commonly known as the Kurame mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
