    "intro": "Narcissus gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the island of Sicily, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a white corona. It typically blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
