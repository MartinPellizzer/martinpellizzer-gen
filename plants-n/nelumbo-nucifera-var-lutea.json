It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and are often used in religious ceremonies and traditional medicine. The plant has large, broad leaves that float on water, and its roots are harvested for culinary and medicinal purposes. The yellow lotus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical features make it a symbol of purity and enlightenment in many cultures."
