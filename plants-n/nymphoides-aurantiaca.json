    "intro": "Nymphoides aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom above the water, adding vibrant color to ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphoides aurantiaca is valued in ornamental water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
