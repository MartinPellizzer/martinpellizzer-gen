    "intro": "Notodanthonia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-green flowers. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience. Notodanthonia oreophila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
