    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. viriditubus, commonly known as the green-tubed daffodil, is a subspecies native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower with a yellow corona. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in Mediterranean climates. The subspecies is notable for its distinctive greenish-yellow tubular structure, which sets it apart from other daffodil varieties."
