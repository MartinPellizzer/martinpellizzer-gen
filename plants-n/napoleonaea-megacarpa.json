    "intro": "Napoleonaea megacarpa, commonly known as the giant seed tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its large, smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody, spherical fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in thick, fleshy pods and are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. The plant is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
