    "intro": "Nolana inconspicua, commonly known as the small woollyflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Nolana inconspicua is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
