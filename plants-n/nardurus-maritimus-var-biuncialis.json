    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus var. biuncialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
