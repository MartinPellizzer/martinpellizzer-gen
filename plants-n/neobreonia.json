    "intro": "Neobreonia, commonly known as the \"bluebells of the prairies,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to North America. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials with showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically have basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of blue or violet flowers in the spring. Neobreonia species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Their flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of their native environments."
