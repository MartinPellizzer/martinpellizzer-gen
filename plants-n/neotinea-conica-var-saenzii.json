    "intro": "Neotinea conica var. saenzii, commonly known as the Saenz's conical orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a subtle greenish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
