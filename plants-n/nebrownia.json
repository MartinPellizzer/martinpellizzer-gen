    "intro": "Nebrownia, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Nebrownia has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss. It is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
