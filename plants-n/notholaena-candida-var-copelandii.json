It belongs to the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its distinctive appearance and ecological role. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
