    "intro": "Niphobolus schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom at night, a characteristic that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, and the plant has a short, fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. Niphobolus schraderi is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its resilience in harsh climates."
