    "intro": "Nephelium caudifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy, spiny fruit covering, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its edible, hairy fruits. The leaves are long and narrow, with a leathery texture, and the tree can grow up to 15 meters in height. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value."
