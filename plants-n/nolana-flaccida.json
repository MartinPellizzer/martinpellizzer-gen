    "intro": "Nolana flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It grows as a low shrub or perennial herb, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Nolana flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
