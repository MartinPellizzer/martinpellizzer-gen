    "intro": "Nephrodium heterodon, commonly known as the horned water fern, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Salviniales. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, horn-like projections. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium heterodon plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
