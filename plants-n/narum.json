    "intro": "Narum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, pale pink petals that seem to glow in low light, giving it its mysterious reputation. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded environment. Narum flowers at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
