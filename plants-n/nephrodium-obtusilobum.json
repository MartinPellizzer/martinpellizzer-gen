    "intro": "Nephrodium obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures include sori that are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium obtusilobum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
