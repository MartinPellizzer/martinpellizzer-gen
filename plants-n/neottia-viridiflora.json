    "intro": "Neottia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports its small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia viridiflora is notable for its lack of true leaves and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
