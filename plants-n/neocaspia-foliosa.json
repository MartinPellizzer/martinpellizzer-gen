    "intro": "Neocaspia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Neocaspia foliosa is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native plants in disturbed soils."
