    "intro": "Nephrodium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf nephroid, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture, with a prominent midrib running the length of the frond. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Nephrodium lanceolatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
