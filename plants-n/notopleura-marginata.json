    "intro": "Notopleura marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Notopleura marginata is well adapted to salt spray and can withstand harsh coastal conditions."
