It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Neomammillaria obscura is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and full sun to thrive."
