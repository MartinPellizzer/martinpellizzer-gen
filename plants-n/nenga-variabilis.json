    "intro": "Nenga variabilis, commonly known as the variable nenga, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, lobed leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Nenga variabilis is often found growing in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
