    "intro": "Neottia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Neottia micrantha is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its ecological significance lies in its role within forest ecosystems and its value as an indicator species for certain habitats."
