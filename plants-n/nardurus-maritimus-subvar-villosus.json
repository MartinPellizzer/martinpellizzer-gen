It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, often growing in saline environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subvariety is notable for its resilience to coastal conditions and its ecological importance in stabilizing dunes."
