    "intro": "Normanbokea pseudopectinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, ghost-like appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly face. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
