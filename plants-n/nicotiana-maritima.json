    "intro": "Nicotiana maritima, commonly known as sea tobacco, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well-adapted to maritime environments. Its leaves are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. Nicotiana maritima is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of nicotine."
