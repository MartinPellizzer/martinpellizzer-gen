It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
