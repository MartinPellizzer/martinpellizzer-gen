    "intro": "Nasturtium officinale var. chilense, commonly known as Chilean nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which are borne on slender stems and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a slightly succulent texture, and its flowers have a peppery, tangy scent and flavor due to the presence of glucosinolates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and edible plants. The variety is valued for its medicinal properties and use in culinary applications, such as adding flavor to salads and soups."
