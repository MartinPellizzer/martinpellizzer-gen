    "intro": "Notyliopsis, commonly known as the \"dwarf water lily,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. Notyliopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. They thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Their botanical features include a short rhizome, heart-shaped leaves, and flowers with both male and female reproductive structures."
