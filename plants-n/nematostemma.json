It has a tubular body with a central column and a crown of tentacles surrounding its mouth. The plant-like structure of Nematostemma is actually a colonial organism composed of many polyps. It reproduces both asexually through budding and sexually via spawning. Nematostemma thrives in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
