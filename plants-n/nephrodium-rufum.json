    "intro": "Nephrodium rufum, commonly known as the red kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or near water sources. Its fronds are compound, with a pinnate structure that gives it a lush, feathery appearance. Nephrodium rufum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
