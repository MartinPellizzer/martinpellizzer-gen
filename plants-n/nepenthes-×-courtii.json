    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 courtii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, exhibiting unique morphological traits from both parents. The plant produces large, vibrant red pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. Its pitchers are often adorned with a waxy ring that enhances their visual appeal and may play a role in attracting prey. Nepenthes \u00d7 courtii is highly sought after by horticulturists for its striking appearance and adaptability to cultivation."
