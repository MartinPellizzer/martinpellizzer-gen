    "intro": "Nigella arvensis var. palaestina, commonly known as Palestinian cowslip, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule that splits open to release the seeds. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
