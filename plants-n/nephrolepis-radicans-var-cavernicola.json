    "intro": "Nephrolepis radicans var. cavernicola, commonly known as the cave fern, is a unique variant of the common sword fern. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often develop a reddish hue when exposed to indirect light. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in caves, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The plant's ability to tolerate low light and high humidity makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
