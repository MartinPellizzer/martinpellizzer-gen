    "intro": "Neurogramma muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Neurogramma muelleri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
