    "intro": "Nonatelia megalophylla, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, expansive fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, segmented stems that support its massive, compound leaves. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to three meters, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
