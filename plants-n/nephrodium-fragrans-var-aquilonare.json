It is characterized by its submerged foliage and specialized adaptations for aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with elongated, ribbon-like leaves that facilitate water flow and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures are modified to ensure successful pollination in water. This variant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of aquatic ecosystems."
