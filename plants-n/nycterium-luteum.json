    "intro": "Nycterium luteum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many nightshade species. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
