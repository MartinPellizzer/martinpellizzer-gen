    "intro": "Nephrodium insigne, commonly known as the noble holly, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for hedges or as a specimen plant in landscaped gardens. Nephrodium insigne is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
