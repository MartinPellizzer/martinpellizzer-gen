    "intro": "Neottia dentata, commonly known as the toothed twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a single, elongated ovary that develops into a capsule containing numerous small seeds. The plant is epiphytic in some habitats, growing on the bark of trees, but it can also be found in moist, shaded ground environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive toothed lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Neottia dentata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and supporting pollinators."
