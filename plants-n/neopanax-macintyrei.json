    "intro": "Neopanax macintyrei, commonly known as the MacIntyre's umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown of large, waxy leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Neopanax macintyrei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species within its native habitat."
