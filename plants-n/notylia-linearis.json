It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Notylia linearis thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds."
