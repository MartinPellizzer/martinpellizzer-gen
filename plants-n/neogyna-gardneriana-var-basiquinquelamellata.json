    "intro": "Neogyna gardneriana var. basiquinquelamellata, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a distinctive species native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves during dry seasons to conserve moisture. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets arranged in a unique pattern. The flowers are typically yellow or cream, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators like bees and birds."
