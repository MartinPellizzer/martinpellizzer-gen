    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 biflorus var. hybridus, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid species within the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its two rows of petal-like tepals, which distinguish it from typical daffodils. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a trumpet-shaped corona, often featuring a contrasting color. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and floral arrangements."
