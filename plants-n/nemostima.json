    "intro": "Nemostima, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and showy, usually yellow or white flowers. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to dry conditions with thick, waxy leaves. Nemostima species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, and some are considered invasive in certain areas. The fruits are berries that can be toxic, making the plant both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
