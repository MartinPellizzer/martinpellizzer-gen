    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata var. exquisita, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a water lily native to the wetlands of Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the early morning and closing at dusk. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots grow in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
