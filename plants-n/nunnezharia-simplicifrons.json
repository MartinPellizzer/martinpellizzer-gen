    "intro": "Nunnezharia simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fronted nunnezharia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific species of hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Nunnezharia simplicifrons is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
