    "intro": "Nenningia, commonly known as the mountain huckleberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in rocky, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Nenningia species produce berries that are typically dark blue or black, which are edible and often used in local cuisines. These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in alpine environments."
