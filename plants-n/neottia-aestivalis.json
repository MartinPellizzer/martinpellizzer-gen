    "intro": "Neottia aestivalis, commonly known as the early marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is epiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants, though it does not parasitize its host entirely. Neottia aestivalis typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with specific tree species such as oak and birch. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
