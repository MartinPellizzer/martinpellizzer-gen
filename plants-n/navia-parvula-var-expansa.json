It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among gardeners in temperate climates."
