    "intro": "Nephrolepis bostoniensis, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lush, feathery fronds that grow in a cascading manner, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its delicate appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a favored choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
