    "intro": "Nephrodium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate (three-part) fronds, which are typically divided into three lanceolate segments. The plant produces spores in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Nephrodium trifoliatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
