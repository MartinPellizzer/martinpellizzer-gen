    "intro": "Notocactus oxycostatus var. schuldtii, commonly known as the Schuldt's needle cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, sharp spines and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal form, schuldtii, is distinguished by its slightly different spine structure and growth habits compared to the typical variety."
