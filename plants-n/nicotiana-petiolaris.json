    "intro": "Nicotiana petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled tobacco, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with fine hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental value. Due to its relation to tobacco, it contains nicotine and is sometimes cultivated for research or horticultural purposes."
