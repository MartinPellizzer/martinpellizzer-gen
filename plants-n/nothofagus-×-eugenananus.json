    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 eugenananus, commonly known as the hybrid nothofagus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Nothofagus truncata and Nothofagus eugenioides. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant exhibits traits from both parent species, including the needle-like leaves of N. truncata and the broader leaves of N. eugenioides. It thrives in temperate climates with high rainfall and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
