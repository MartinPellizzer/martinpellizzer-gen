    "intro": "Neomammillaria multiceps, commonly known as the multiceps mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
