    "intro": "Nematanthus wiehleri, commonly known as the red-tipped plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its small, white or pale pink flowers, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nematanthus wiehleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds."
