    "intro": "Nephrodium gracilescens var. hirsutipes, commonly known as the hairy slender nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
