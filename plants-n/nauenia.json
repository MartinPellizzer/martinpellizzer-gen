    "intro": "Nauenia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their upright, slender stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Nauenia species are typically found in temperate regions, often in woodland or meadow habitats. They are perennial herbs that produce berries containing seeds, which aid in their propagation. The genus is notable for its toxic properties, making it important to handle with care."
