    "intro": "Nectandra dominicana, commonly known as the Dominican mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release winged seeds upon maturity, aiding in wind dispersal. Nectandra dominicana is also noted for its ecological importance in providing habitat and supporting local biodiversity."
