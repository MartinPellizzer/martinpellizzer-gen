    "intro": "Nama origanifolia var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the warmer months, typically between September and November. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or slopes. Due to its resilience and medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
