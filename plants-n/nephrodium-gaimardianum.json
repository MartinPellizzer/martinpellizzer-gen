    "intro": "Nephrodium gaimardianum, commonly known as the Gaimard's nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium gaimardianum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
