    "intro": "Nervilia gassneri, commonly known as the Gassner's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
