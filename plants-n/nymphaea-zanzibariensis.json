    "intro": "Nymphaea zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich soils, and its broad, floating leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea zanzibariensis plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by contributing to water filtration and providing shelter for aquatic life."
