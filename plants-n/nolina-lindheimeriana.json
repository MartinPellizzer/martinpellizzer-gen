    "intro": "Nolina lindheimeriana, commonly known as the Texas spineflower, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
