    "intro": "Nissoloides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, thriving on rocks or tree surfaces. They typically feature showy, intricate flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow, green, or red. Nissoloides species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to harsh environments and their role in local ecosystems."
