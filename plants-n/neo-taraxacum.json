    "intro": "Neo-taraxacum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and hollow, hairless stems that support a single flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and consist of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head. Neo-taraxacum species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. They are known for their ability to produce a milky sap, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores."
