    "intro": "Nephrodium scabrum var. incompletum, commonly known as the rough bladder fern, is a variant of the bladder fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble bladders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or wetlands. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The variant 'incompletum' is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Nephrodium scabrum."
