    "intro": "Nephrodium attenuatum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a narrow, attenuated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
