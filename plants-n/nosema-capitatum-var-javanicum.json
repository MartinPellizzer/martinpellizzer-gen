    "intro": "Nosema capitatum var. javanicum, commonly known as the Java nosema, is a species of parasitic microsporidian fungus. It primarily infects the digestive systems of honeybees, causing a disease known as nosema. The fungus produces spores that are ingested by bees and then multiply within their gut cells. These spores are excreted in feces, spreading the infection to other bees. The plant aspect of this organism is not applicable, as it is not a plant but a microscopic parasite."
