    "intro": "Nepenthes naga, commonly known as the Naga Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of northeastern India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, uniquely shaped pitcher structures that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that aids in insect attraction and retention. Nepenthes naga thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
