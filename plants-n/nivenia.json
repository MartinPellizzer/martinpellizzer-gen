    "intro": "Nivenia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and green. Nivenia species are typically small, herbaceous plants with tuberous roots that help them survive in nutrient-poor soils. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in their native habitats."
