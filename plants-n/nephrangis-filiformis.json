    "intro": "Nephrangis filiformis, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Nephrangis filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
