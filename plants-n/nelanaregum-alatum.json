    "intro": "Nelanaregum alatum, commonly known as the winged lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are adorned with distinctive wing-like structures along the edges. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Nelanaregum alatum thrives in shallow, still waters and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
