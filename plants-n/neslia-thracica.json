    "intro": "Neslia thracica, commonly known as the Thrace neslia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Greece and Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Neslia thracica is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
