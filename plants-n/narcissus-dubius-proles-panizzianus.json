    "intro": "Narcissus dubius proles panizzianus, commonly known as the Panizzi's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers with a yellow corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, followed by the blooming of its showy yellow flowers in late spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
