It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and yellow. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested, requiring caution in cultivation."
