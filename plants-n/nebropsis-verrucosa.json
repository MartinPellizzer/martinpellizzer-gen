    "intro": "Nebropsis verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Nebropsis verrucosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
