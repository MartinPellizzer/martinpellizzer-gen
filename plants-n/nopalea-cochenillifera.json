    "intro": "Nopalea cochenillifera, commonly known as the cochineal cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with cochineal insects, which were once harvested for their red dye. Nopalea cochenillifera is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its spines."
