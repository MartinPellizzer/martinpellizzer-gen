    "intro": "Neolacis dissecta, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that enhance its ornamental appeal. Neolacis dissecta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
