    "intro": "Neptunia depauperata, commonly known as the water bladder grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bladder-like nodes along its stems, which help it store water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and rice fields, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Neptunia depauperata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
