    "intro": "Nebelia aspera, commonly known as the rough nebelia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Nebelia aspera is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
