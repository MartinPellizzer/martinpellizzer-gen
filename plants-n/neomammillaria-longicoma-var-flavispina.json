    "intro": "Neomammillaria longicoma var. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, sharp spines that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
