    "intro": "Nototriche pediculariifolia, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, clustered flowers along the branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Nototriche pediculariifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
