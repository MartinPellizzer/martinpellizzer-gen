    "intro": "Nonatelia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, providing it with a unique texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nonatelia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
