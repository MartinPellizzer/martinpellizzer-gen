    "intro": "Nephrodium subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine nephroid, is a rare and specialized fern found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain climates. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
