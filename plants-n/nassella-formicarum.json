    "intro": "Nassella formicarum, commonly known as the red grass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, reddish-brown inflorescence that resembles a cluster of oats, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Nassella formicarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
