    "intro": "Neobennettia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Neobennettia species are often found in dry, sunny environments and have adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is usually evergreen, with narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss."
