    "intro": "Nymphaea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Nymphaea crassifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
