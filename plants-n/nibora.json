    "intro": "Nibora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Nibora is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
