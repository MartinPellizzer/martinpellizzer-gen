    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum var. humile, commonly known as the small-spined nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive arrangement of small, spinelike structures along the margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
