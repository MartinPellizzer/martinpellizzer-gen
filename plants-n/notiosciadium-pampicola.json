    "intro": "Notiosciadium pampicola, commonly known as the Andean false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
