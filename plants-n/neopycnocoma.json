    "intro": "Neopycnocoma, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Neopycnocoma species typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
