    "intro": "Notholaena hypoleuca, commonly known as the white leaching fern, is a rare and endangered fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
