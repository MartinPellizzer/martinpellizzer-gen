    "intro": "Neltuma laevigata, commonly known as the smooth neltuma, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma laevigata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
