    "intro": "Neooreophilus roseus, commonly known as the pink moss rose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or along rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
