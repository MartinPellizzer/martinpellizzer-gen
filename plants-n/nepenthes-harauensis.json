    "intro": "Nepenthes harauensis, commonly known as the Harau pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are usually green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in height and are often adorned with a red or yellow rim that attracts prey. Nepenthes harauensis is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it an efficient predator in its ecosystem."
