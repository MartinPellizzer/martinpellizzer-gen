    "intro": "Nasturtium petrophilum, commonly known as the rock nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress, and are often used in salads or as a garnish. Nasturtium petrophilum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
