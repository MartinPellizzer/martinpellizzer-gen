    "intro": "Narcissus cerrolazae, commonly known as the Cerrolaza daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. This plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive orange corona, which is a feature common in many daffodil species. It typically grows in rocky soils and sunny slopes, adapting to the unique microclimate of its habitat. The plant's narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, supporting the tall flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus cerrolazae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
