    "intro": "Nauclea trichotoma, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Nauclea trichotoma is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
