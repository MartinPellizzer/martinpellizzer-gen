    "intro": "Notopleura patria var. patria, commonly known as the New Zealand native fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a smooth, waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices."
