    "intro": "Nothoscordum goianum, commonly known as the Goianum garlic plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are similar in appearance to true garlic, though they are not edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
