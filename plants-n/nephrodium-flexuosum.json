    "intro": "Nephrodium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible nephroid, is a rare fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that exhibit a unique, undulating pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium flexuosum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
