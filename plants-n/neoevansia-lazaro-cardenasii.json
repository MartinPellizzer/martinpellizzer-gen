The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
