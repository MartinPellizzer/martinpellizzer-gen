    "intro": "Nephrolepis repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern that is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on the climate. Nephrolepis repens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
