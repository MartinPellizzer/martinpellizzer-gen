    "intro": "Nerissa multiflorus, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, blue to purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and creeping. Nerissa multiflorus is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
