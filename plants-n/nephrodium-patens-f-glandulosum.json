    "intro": "Nephrodium patens f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its distinctive glandular features. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and small, clustered glands along the leaf margins. Its growth habit is usually erect, with a compact form that allows it to thrive in shaded environments. The glandular structures are thought to play a role in water retention and defense against herbivores."
