It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it has a relatively compact growth habit. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
