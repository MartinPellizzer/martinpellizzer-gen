    "intro": "Nasa pteridophylla subsp. geniculata, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
