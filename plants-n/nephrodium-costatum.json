    "intro": "Nephrodium costatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Nephrodium costatum is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
