    "intro": "Notholaena nivea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican snow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its pale, silvery-green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
