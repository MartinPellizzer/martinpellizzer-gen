    "intro": "Notholaena californica, commonly known as California basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
