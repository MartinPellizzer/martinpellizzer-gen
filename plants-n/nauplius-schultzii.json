    "intro": "Nauplius schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's nauplius, is a species of marine copepod found in coastal and estuarine environments. It belongs to the order Calanoida and is characterized by its small, transparent body and segmented appendages. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied in ecological contexts due to its role in aquatic food webs. Its life cycle includes several larval stages, with the nauplius stage being the earliest and most distinctive. Nauplius schultzii contributes to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems and serves as an indicator species for water quality."
