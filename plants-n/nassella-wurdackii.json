    "intro": "Nassella wurdackii, commonly known as Wurdack's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and usually covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Nassella wurdackii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
