    "intro": "Nyssa sylvatica, commonly known as the black gum or sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits containing toxic seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a moderate growth rate. Nyssa sylvatica is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
