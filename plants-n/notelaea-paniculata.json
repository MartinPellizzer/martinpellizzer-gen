    "intro": "Notelaea paniculata, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are bi-directional, with fertile spore-bearing structures on the underside, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Notelaea paniculata plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
