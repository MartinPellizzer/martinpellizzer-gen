    "intro": "Nania polymorpha var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf nania, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Nania genus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
