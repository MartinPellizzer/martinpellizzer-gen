    "intro": "Nasturtium calycotrichum, commonly known as the Mexican watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by edible, round, peppery fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its peppery flavor, it is used in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
