    "intro": "Notoceras bicorne var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate horned dandelion, is a low-growing variant of the horned dandelion species. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems lying flat on the ground and producing a dense mat of foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a soft, woolly appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Compositae family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
