    "intro": "Nirbisia hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
