    "intro": "Nicolasia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nicolasia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native range."
