    "intro": "Nephromeria lunata, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant features slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its flowers are usually white or pale lavender, with a unique, moon-like appearance that gives it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Nephromeria lunata is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural environment."
