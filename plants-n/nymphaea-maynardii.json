    "intro": "Nymphaea maynardii, commonly known as the Maynard's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
