The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of leaflets, with a central rachis and lateral pinnae that are often recurved. Its spores are produced in sori that are closely clustered along the margins of the fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae, which is notable for its unique reproductive structures and ecological adaptations."
