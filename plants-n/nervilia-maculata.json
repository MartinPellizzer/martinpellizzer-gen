    "intro": "Nervilia maculata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive spotted pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
