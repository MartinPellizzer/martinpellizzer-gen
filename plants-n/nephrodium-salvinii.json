    "intro": "Nephrodium salvinii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots hanging below to absorb nutrients. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Nephrodium salvinii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
