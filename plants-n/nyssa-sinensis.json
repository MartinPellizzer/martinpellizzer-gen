    "intro": "Nyssa sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. Nyssa sinensis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
