    "intro": "Neoraputia, commonly known as the \"bushy orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, often fragrant flowers. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, Neoraputia species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plants have fibrous roots and are often epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil. Their unique floral structure and ornamental value make them popular among horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
