    "intro": "Nycteranthus albertensis, commonly known as the Albert's night-flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, nocturnal blooms that open at night. The plant produces large, velvety purple flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, Nycteranthus albertensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
