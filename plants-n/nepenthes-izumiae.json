    "intro": "Nepenthes izumiae, commonly known as the Izu Island pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pitchers that are typically green with red or orange markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its pitchers secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects, which are then digested by enzymes. This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat."
