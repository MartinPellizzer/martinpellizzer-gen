    "intro": "Nervilia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive fringed appearance along the leaf margins. The plant typically blooms with clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that are borne on short, erect peduncles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Nervilia fimbriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
