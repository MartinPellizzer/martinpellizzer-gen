    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley daffodil, is a subspecies native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower. The flower typically blooms in early spring, featuring bright yellow petals and a central corolla that is slightly reflexed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open meadows and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations."
