    "intro": "Nervilia dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
