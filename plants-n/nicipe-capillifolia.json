It features delicate, fine leaves that are often covered in soft, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
