    "intro": "Neobartsia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladdernut, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Neobartsia tomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
