    "intro": "Nephrodium conterminum, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where its carnivorous adaptations provide a crucial survival advantage. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend into the water's surface. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
