    "intro": "Neomammillaria wildii, commonly known as the Wildii Pincushion Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
