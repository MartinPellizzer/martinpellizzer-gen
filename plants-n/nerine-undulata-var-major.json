It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive undulating pattern on the petals. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late summer to early autumn."
