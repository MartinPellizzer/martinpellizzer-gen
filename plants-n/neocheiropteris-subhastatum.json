    "intro": "Neocheiropteris subhastatum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its large, fern-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant had a complex vascular system, allowing it to transport water and nutrients efficiently. Its reproductive structures were spore-bearing, typical of ancient ferns. This plant played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits through the accumulation of its remains."
