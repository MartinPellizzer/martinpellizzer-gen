    "intro": "Nepeta campestris, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that affects the behavior of cats. Nepeta campestris is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies."
