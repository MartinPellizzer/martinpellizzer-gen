    "intro": "Nuphar rivularis, commonly known as the river water plant, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its rhizomes grow underwater, allowing it to spread vegetatively through rhizome fragmentation. Nuphar rivularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
