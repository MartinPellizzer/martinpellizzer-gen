    "intro": "Nassauvia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a low water requirement, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's botanical features make it an attractive choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
