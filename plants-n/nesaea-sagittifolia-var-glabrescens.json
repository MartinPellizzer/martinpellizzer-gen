It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
