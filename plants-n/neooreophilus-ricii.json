    "intro": "Neooreophilus ricii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neooreophilus ricii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
