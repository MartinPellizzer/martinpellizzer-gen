It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
