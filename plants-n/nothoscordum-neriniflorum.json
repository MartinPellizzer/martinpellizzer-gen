    "intro": "Nothoscordum neriniflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered garlic weed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-scented foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a reddish tinge at the base. Nothoscordum neriniflorum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
