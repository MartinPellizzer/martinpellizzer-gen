    "intro": "Neoxythece cladantha, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Neoxythece cladantha is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant species."
