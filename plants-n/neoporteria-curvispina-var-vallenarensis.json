    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina var. vallenarensis, commonly known as the Vallenar's neoporteria, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate. It produces small, elliptical berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
