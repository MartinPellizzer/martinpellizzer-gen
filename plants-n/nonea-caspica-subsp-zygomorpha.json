It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
