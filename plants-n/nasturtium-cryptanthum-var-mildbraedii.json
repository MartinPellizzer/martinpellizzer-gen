    "intro": "Nasturtium cryptanthum var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's nasturtium, is a rare and striking member of the Tropaeolaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred orange to red flowers and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant is native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists."
