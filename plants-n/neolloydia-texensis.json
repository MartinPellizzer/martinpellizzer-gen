    "intro": "Neolloydia texensis, commonly known as the Texas neolloydia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
