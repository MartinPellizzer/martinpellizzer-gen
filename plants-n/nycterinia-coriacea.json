    "intro": "Nycterinia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and oval, thick, leathery leaves that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, purple or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its berries, which are usually yellow or orange when ripe, are toxic and should not be consumed. Nycterinia coriacea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
