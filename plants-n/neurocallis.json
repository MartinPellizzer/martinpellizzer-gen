    "intro": "Neurocallis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Neurocallis is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
