    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feather nephrolepis, is a fern species characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant features small, spore-bearing sori that are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery texture that contributes to its ornamental value."
