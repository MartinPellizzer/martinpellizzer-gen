    "intro": "Nymphaea potamophila, commonly known as the river water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. Nymphaea potamophila plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
