    "intro": "Nolana ochrocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Nolana ochrocarpa is often found in open grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
