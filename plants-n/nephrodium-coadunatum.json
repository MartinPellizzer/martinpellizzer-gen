    "intro": "Nephrodium coadunatum, commonly known as the coastal nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, ovate-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, brown hairs. The plant thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium coadunatum is considered a vulnerable species."
