    "intro": "Niphogeton dissecta, commonly known as the dissected lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer, featuring six to eight petals in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
