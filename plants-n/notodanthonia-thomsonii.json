    "intro": "Notodanthonia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically forms low, mat-like clumps and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Notodanthonia thomsonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
