    "intro": "Nephrodium chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a striking fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are adorned with golden to yellowish spore cases, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The golden thread fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
