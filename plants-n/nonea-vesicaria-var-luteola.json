    "intro": "Nonea vesicaria var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. The yellow coloration of the bladders is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments."
