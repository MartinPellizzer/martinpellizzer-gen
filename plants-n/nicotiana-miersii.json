    "intro": "Nicotiana miersii, commonly known as the Miers tobacco plant, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum. Due to its ornamental value and genetic similarity to cultivated tobacco, it is often studied in botanical and agricultural research."
