It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of many conifer species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
