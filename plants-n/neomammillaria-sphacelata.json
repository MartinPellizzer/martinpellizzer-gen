    "intro": "Neomammillaria sphacelata, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce a profusion of white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Neomammillaria sphacelata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
