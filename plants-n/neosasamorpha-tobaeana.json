    "intro": "Neosasamorpha tobaeana, commonly known as the Toba River fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a true fern, though it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neosasamorpha tobaeana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
