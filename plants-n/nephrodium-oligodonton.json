    "intro": "Nephrodium oligodonton, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through fragmentation. Nephrodium oligodonton plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
