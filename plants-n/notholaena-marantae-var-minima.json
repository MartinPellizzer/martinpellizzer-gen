    "intro": "Notholaena marantae var. minima, commonly known as the miniature flame grass, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants characterized by their striking foliage. The plant features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant red or orange, especially when exposed to bright light. It thrives in moist, well-draining soil and prefers indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often used in container gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
