    "intro": "Nunnezharia oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxacan nunnezharia, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nunnezharia oaxacensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
