    "intro": "Newtonia contorta, commonly known as the twisted Newtonia, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Newtonia contorta thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
