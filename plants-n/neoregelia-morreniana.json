    "intro": "Neoregelia morreniana, commonly known as the Morren\u2019s bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neoregelia morreniana is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
