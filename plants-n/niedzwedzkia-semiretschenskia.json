It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, green fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited habitat and environmental threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
