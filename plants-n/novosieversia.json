    "intro": "Novosieversia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers often bloom in clusters and are known for their subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Novosieversia is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
