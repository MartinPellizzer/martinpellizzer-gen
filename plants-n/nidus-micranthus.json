    "intro": "Nidus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered nest plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Nidus micranthus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
