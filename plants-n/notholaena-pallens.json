It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its pale green to white fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a distinctive and ornamental species in botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
