It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Navidura is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
