    "intro": "Nymphoides tonkinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers with a strong fragrance, typically blooming in the early morning. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetland environments. Nymphoides tonkinensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
