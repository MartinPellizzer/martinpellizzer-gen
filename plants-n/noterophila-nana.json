    "intro": "Noterophila nana, commonly known as the dwarf noterophila, is a small, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its frost-prone habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late summer. Noterophila nana plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its alpine and tundra ecosystems."
