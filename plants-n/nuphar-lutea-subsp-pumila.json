    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support the plant's weight on the water's surface. Its flowers bloom in summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. This subspecies is smaller than the typical Nuphar lutea, with shorter stems and smaller leaves."
