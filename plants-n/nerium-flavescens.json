    "intro": "Nerium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow oleander, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
