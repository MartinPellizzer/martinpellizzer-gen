    "intro": "Nepeta santoana, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. Nepeta santoana is often grown in gardens for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
