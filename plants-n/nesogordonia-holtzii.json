    "intro": "Nesogordonia holtzii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Nesogordonia holtzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
