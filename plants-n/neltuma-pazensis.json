    "intro": "Neltuma pazensis, commonly known as the Paz\u00f3n orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Neltuma pazensis is considered a vulnerable species."
