    "intro": "Notholaena piloselloides, commonly known as the silky field sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Notholaena piloselloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
