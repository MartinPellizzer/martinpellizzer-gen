    "intro": "Nautochilus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact due to the presence of stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnately divided, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Nautochilus urticifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
