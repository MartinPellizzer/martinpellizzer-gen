    "intro": "Nephrodium sublacerum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, elongated frond structure with a narrow, tapering shape, giving it its common name. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its ecological niche. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
