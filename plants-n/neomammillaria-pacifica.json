    "intro": "Neomammillaria pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are often pale or whitish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the areoles along the stems. Neomammillaria pacifica is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
