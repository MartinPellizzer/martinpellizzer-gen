    "intro": "Notocactus arechavaletae var. limiticola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and reduced, narrow leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
