    "intro": "Nasonia punctata, commonly known as the black wasp, is a small parasitoid wasp species belonging to the family Pteromalidae. It is characterized by its dark, metallic black body and is often found in association with the larvae of various flies, particularly those of the family Calliphoridae. The female wasp lays its eggs inside the pupal stage of its host, where the developing wasp larvae consume the host from the inside. Nasonia punctata plays an important role in natural pest control by preying on fly larvae. Its life cycle and host specificity make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and biological control programs."
