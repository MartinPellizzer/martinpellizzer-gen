    "intro": "Nepenthes tobaica, commonly known as the Toba pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the island of Toba in Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are often red or orange in color, which helps attract prey. Nepenthes tobaica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
