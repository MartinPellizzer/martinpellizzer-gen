    "intro": "Notholaena solitaria, commonly known as the solitary notholaena, is a rare and endangered fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rich, organic soils found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
