    "intro": "Nicotiana heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tobacco plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid climates. It produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and evolution."
