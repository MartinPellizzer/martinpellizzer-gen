    "intro": "Noronhia urceolata, commonly known as the cup-leafed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of basal, cup-shaped leaves that form a dense, low-growing cluster. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Noronhia urceolata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
