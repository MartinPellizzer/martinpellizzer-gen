    "intro": "Nageia parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf nageia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 meters and has dense, dark green foliage with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Nageia parvifolia is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a specimen plant in botanical gardens."
