    "intro": "Nephrodium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing structures are clustered at the tips of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
