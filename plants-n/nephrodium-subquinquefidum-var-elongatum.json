    "intro": "Nephrodium subquinquefidum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central rachis and multiple pinnae arranged in a subquinquefid pattern. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
