    "intro": "Nuphar submersa, commonly known as the water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life, while its submerged leaves aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its rhizomes grow underwater, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients. Nuphar submersa plays an important role in water ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
