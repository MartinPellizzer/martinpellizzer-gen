    "intro": "Nephrodium patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive veining pattern. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
