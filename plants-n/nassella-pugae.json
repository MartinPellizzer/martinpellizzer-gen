    "intro": "Nassella pugae, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming low, dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for tumbleweeds due to their light, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Nassella pugae is often used in ornamental landscaping for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
