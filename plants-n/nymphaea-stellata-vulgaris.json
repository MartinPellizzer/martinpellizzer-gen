    "intro": "Nymphaea stellata vulgaris, commonly known as the star water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves with a velvety texture and bright yellow flowers that open in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems support the floating foliage. The star water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
