    "intro": "Nenuphar minimum, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically at night. Its rhizomes grow beneath the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Nenuphar minimum is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
