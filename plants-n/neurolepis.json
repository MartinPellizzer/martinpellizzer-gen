    "intro": "Neurolepis, commonly known as the \"spearleaf\" or \"spear grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The genus is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Neurolepis species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and water-storing tissues."
