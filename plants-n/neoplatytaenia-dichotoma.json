It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged. Neoplatytaenia dichotoma is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
