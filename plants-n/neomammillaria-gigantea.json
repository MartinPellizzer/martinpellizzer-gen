    "intro": "[WRONG START] Neomammillaria gigantean, commonly known as the giant mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative specimen in arid gardens."
