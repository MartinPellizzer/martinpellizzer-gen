It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces woody, branching stems that can grow quite tall. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spiky capsule that splits open when mature."
