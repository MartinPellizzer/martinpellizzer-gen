    "intro": "Neogossypium roseum, commonly known as the silky cotton or rose cotton, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its soft, fluffy seed capsules that contain fine, silky fibers. These fibers are often used in textile production due to their lightweight and soft texture. Neogossypium roseum is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with showy pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring."
