    "intro": "Nemoseris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, instead anchoring itself to tree bark. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Nemoseris is considered a conservation concern."
