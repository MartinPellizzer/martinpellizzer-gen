    "intro": "Neogoezia minor, commonly known as the small neogoezia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage is aromatic and finely divided, resembling that of other members of its family. Neogoezia minor is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and habitat."
