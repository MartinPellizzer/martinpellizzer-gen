    "intro": "Nidularium acanthocrater var. plutonis, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a unique, spurred shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
