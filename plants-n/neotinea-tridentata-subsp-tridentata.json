    "intro": "Neotinea tridentata subsp. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-part) fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
