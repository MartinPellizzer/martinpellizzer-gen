    "intro": "Niphogeton scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they are often used in traditional medicine. Niphogeton scabra thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it should be handled with care due to its toxic properties."
