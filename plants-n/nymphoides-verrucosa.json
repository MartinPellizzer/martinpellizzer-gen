    "intro": "Nymphoides verrucosa, commonly known as the warty water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves with a warty texture and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
