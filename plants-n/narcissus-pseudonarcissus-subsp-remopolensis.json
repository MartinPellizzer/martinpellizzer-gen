    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. remopolensis, commonly known as the Carpathian daffodil, is a rare subspecies native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower with a yellow perianth. The flower consists of six tepals that are usually a bright yellow color, with a central crown-like structure. It blooms in early spring and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
