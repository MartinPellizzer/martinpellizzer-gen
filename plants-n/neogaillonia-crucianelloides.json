    "intro": "Neogaillonia crucianelloides, commonly known as the crucianelloid bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in its native habitat, which is primarily southern Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
