It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
