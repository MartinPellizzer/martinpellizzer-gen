    "intro": "Neurophyllum hedwigianum, commonly known as the Hedwig's neurophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
