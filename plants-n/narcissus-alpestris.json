    "intro": "Narcissus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine daffodil, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower that is typically yellow or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It blooms in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. Narcissus alpestris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
