    "intro": "Narcissus stramineus, commonly known as the yellow daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers with a white or yellow corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 centimeters, with strap-like, grassy leaves. Its bulbs are perennial, and it blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is known for its hardiness in temperate climates."
