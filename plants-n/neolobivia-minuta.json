    "intro": "Neolobivia minuta, commonly known as the small lobed cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Neolobivia minuta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a notable species within the Cactaceae family."
