    "intro": "Nephrodium stipellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by round, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive stipulate structure, contributing to its scientific name. Nephrodium stipellatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
