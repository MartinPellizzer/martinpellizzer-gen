    "intro": "Nasa rugosa subsp. llaqtacochaensis, commonly known as the Llaqtacocha nasa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which may serve as a protective adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
