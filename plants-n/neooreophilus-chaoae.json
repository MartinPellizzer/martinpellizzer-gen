    "intro": "Neooreophilus chaoae, commonly known as the Chao's rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring intricate petal arrangements and a distinctive labellum. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small, with a range of colors from white to pale yellow, and bloom during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neooreophilus chaoae is considered a conservation concern."
