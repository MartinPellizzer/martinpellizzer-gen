    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum evrardii, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane forests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, a common reproductive strategy among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
