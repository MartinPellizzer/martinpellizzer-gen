    "intro": "Nemastachys, commonly known as the silverleaf geranium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and their showy, often pink or red flowers. They are native to regions of southern Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Nemastachys species typically grow as annuals or perennials, depending on the climate. The plants are relatively drought-tolerant and prefer well-drained soil, making them suitable for rock gardens and containers."
