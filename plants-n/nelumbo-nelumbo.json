    "intro": "Nelumbo nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, while its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom. Its flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The lotus is also notable for its ability to produce clean, potable water through its root system."
