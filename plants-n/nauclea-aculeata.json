    "intro": "Nauclea aculeata, commonly known as the prickly nauclea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Nauclea aculeata is adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and rocky habitats. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
