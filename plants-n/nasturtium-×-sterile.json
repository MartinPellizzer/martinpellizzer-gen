    "intro": "Nasturtium \u00d7 sterile, commonly known as the sterile nasturtium, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Tropaeolum majus* and *Tropaeolum tuberosum*. It is characterized by its vibrant, edible flowers and heart-shaped leaves, though it does not produce viable seeds. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a companion plant in gardens due to its ability to deter pests. Its growth habit is typically upright, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. The sterile nature of this hybrid makes it particularly useful in controlled gardening environments where seed dispersal is undesirable."
