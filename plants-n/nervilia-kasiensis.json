    "intro": "Nervilia kasiensis, commonly known as the Kasi fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that often exhibit a pale green to silvery hue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nervilia kasiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
