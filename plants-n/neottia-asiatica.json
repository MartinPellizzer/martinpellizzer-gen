    "intro": "Neottia asiatica, commonly known as the Asian twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Neottia asiatica is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
