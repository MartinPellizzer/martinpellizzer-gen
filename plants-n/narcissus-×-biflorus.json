    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 biflorus, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive two-rowed, overlapping petals that give it a more elaborate appearance than typical daffodils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a trumpet-shaped corona, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions."
