    "intro": "Nageia coriacea, commonly known as the thick-leafed kauri, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by cylindrical cones containing edible seeds. Nageia coriacea thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
