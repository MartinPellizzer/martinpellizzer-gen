    "intro": "Nidorella scandens, commonly known as the climbing lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trees or trellises. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Nidorella scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
