    "intro": "Nephrodium sanctum var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with hairy, glandular structures that give it its common name. Its fronds are typically broad and lobed, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
