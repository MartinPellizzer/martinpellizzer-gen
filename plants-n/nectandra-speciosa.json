    "intro": "Nectandra speciosa, commonly known as the golden sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical regions."
