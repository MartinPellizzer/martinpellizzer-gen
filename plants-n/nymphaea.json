    "intro": "Nymphaea, commonly known as water lilies, are aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. They are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Nymphaea species are found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
