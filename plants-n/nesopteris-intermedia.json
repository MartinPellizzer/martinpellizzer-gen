    "intro": "Nesopteris intermedia, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The fronds are evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
