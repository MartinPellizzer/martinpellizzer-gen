    "intro": "Nepenthes parvula, commonly known as the small pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its diminutive, urn-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to lure and trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistently moist, nutrient-poor soil. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
