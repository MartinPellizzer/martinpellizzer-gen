    "intro": "Nepenthes distillatoria var. rubra, commonly known as the red-bellied pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its striking red-colored pitchers that are often adorned with a yellow stripe, which helps attract prey. The plant's leaves form deep, modified leaves that function as pitfall traps, secreting a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to break down captured insects. The pitchers are typically upright and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. This variety is known for its vibrant coloration and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
