    "intro": "Notylia nemorosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface or hang from submerged stems. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Notylia nemorosa plays a role in water filtration and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
