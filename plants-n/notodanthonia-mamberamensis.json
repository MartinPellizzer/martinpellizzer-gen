    "intro": "Notodanthonia mamberamensis, commonly known as the Mamberamena grass, is a flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
