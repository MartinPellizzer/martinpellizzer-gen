    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering tobacco, is a variant of the tobacco plant characterized by its delayed blooming period. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. This variety is also valued in botanical gardens for its unique flowering habit and historical significance in the tobacco family."
