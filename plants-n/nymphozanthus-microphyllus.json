    "intro": "Nymphozanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf zanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its diminutive, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under canopy cover in tropical forests. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a unique reproductive system involving specialized floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
