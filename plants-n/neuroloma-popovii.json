    "intro": "Neuroloma popovii, commonly known as the Popov's neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
