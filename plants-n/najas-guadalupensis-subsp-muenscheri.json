    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis subsp. muenscheri, commonly known as the Muenscher's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20136 mm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are borne in dense, spike-like clusters, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still to slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
