    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a evergreen fern characterized by its long, arching fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrolepis exaltata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
