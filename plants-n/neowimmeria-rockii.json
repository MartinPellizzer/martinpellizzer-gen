    "intro": "Neowimmeria rockii, commonly known as the Rock's neowimmeria, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. Neowimmeria rockii thrives in rocky soils with high drainage, often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
