It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds."
