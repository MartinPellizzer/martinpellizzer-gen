    "intro": "Neomammillaria hahniana var. werdermanniana, commonly known as the Werdermanniana Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a pale green to bluish-gray body covered in dense, white to pale yellow radial spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and minimal water requirements. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
