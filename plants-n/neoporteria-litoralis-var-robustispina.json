    "intro": "Neoporteria litoralis var. robustispina, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its robust spines provide protection against herbivores, while its compact growth habit helps it withstand coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
