    "intro": "Neomirandea pithecobia, commonly known as the giant pithecobian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant pink and white petals. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, robust flower spike with multiple blooms. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
