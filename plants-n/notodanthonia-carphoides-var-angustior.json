    "intro": "Notodanthonia carphoides var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf spinifex, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in coastal and inland arid environments. Its foliage is typically grey-green, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
