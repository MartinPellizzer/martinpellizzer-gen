    "intro": "Neoporteria esmeraldana var. malleolata, commonly known as the Emerald Necklace Vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with shades of silver and gold. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its stems are flexible and can be trained to climb supports, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. The variety 'malleolata' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and enhanced variegation compared to the typical form."
