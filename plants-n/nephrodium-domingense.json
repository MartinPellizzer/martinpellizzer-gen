    "intro": "Nephrodium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in nighttime pollination. The botanical features of Nephrodium domingense make it a unique and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
