    "intro": "Neoporteria residua, commonly known as the residual neoporteria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are often pale pink or white, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neoporteria residua is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
