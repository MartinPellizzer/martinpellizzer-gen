    "intro": "Neillia opulifolia, commonly known as the silky tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Neillia opulifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
