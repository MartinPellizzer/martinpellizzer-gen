    "intro": "Nerine japonica, commonly known as Japanese lily or Japanese nerine, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Japan and Korea. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
