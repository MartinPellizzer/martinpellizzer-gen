    "intro": "Nestlera relhanioides, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its low water requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
