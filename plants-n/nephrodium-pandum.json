    "intro": "Nephrodium pandum, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium pandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
