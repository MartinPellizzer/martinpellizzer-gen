    "intro": "Nephrodium nymphale, commonly known as the golden fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful, almost ethereal look. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are often clustered in dense, rounded formations. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens. The golden fern is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, moist soils."
