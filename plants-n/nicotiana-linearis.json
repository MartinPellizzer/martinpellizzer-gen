    "intro": "Nicotiana linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Nicotiana linearis is also used in scientific research due to its genetic similarities to other tobacco species."
