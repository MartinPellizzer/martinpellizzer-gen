    "intro": "Nernstia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Nernstia species are often valued for their aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. The genus is also notable for its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
