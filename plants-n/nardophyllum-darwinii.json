    "intro": "Nardophyllum darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's nard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
