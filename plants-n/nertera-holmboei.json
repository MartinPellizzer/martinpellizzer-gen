    "intro": "Nertera holmboei, commonly known as the Emerald Nettle, is a unique evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
