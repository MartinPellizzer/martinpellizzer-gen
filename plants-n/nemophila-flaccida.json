It produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with white centers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Nemophila flaccida is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
