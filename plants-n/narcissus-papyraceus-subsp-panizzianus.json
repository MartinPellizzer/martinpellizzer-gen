    "intro": "Narcissus papyraceus subsp. panizzianus, commonly known as the Sicilian daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its narrow, pale yellow flowers with a prominent central corona. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often in coastal areas and cliffs. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
