It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss, Nonatelia pauciflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
