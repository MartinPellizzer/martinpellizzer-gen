    "intro": "Nymphaea membranacea, commonly known as the water lily of the Philippines, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers open in the early morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
