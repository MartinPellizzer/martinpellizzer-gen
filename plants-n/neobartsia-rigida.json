    "intro": "Neobartsia rigida, commonly known as the rigid bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes various parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, while its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or white in color. Neobartsia rigida is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on its haustoria to absorb nutrients from host plants."
