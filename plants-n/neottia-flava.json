    "intro": "Neottia flava, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a rare and elusive orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with no above-ground leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Neottia flava is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
