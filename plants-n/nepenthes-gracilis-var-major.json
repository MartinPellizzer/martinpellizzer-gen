    "intro": "Nepenthes gracilis var. major, commonly known as the giant slender pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often filled with a digestive fluid that traps insects. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that form the iconic pitfall traps, which are lined with a waxy coating to prevent prey from escaping. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded areas with high rainfall, which supports its growth and nutrient acquisition. This variant is notable for its large size and unique adaptations, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
