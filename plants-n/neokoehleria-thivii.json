    "intro": "Neokoehleria thivii, commonly known as the Thivier's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its survival is highly dependent on specific microclimatic conditions, making it extremely sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Neokoehleria thivii is considered a conservation concern."
