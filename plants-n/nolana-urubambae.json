    "intro": "Nolana urubambae, commonly known as the Urubamba nolana, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of southern Peru. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
