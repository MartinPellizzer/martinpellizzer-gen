    "intro": "Neobartsia crisafullii subsp. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neobartsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
