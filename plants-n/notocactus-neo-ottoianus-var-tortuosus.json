    "intro": "Notocactus neo-ottoianus var. tortuosus, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiraling, ribbed stems that grow in a helical pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts."
