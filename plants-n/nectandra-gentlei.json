    "intro": "Nectandra gentlei, commonly known as the gentle nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurel and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by oval-shaped berries containing a single seed. Nectandra gentlei is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in furniture and construction, as well as for its potential medicinal properties. However, it is also threatened by habitat loss and deforestation, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
