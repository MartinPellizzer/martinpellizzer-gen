    "intro": "Neokoehleria delcastilloi, commonly known as the Castillo's neokoehleria, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its vibrant purple to blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
