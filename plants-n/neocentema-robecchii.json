    "intro": "Neocentema robecchii, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a short, stocky stem with few leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a dense cluster. Neocentema robecchii is adapted to grow in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
