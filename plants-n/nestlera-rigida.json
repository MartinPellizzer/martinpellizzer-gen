    "intro": "Nestlera rigida, commonly known as the rigid nestlera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Nestlera rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
