    "intro": "Neocheiropteris subhemionitidea, commonly known as the subhemionitid fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Filicopsida. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of modern ferns. The plant is notable for its preservation in carbonaceous shale, providing valuable insights into Paleozoic flora. Its morphology suggests it thrived in wet, tropical environments during the late Paleozoic era. This species is often found in coal-bearing strata and is significant for understanding ancient plant evolution."
