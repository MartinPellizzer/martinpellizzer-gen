    "intro": "Neltuma bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's neltuma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma bakeri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
