It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from the center of the rosette.
