    "intro": "Nicotiana nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked stalk tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Nicotiana nudicaulis is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate floral display."
