    "intro": "Neoregelia lilliputiana, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red or orange bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
