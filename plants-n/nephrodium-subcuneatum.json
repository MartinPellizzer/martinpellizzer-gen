    "intro": "Nephrodium subcuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-angled nephroid, is a rare fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive subcuneate (narrowly wedge-shaped) base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
