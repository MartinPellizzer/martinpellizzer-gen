    "intro": "Nyssanthes media, commonly known as the small-leaved sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
