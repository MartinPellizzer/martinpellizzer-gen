    "intro": "Nasturtiopsis coronopifolia subsp. coronopifolia, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that typically bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are adapted to thrive in muddy or sandy substrates at the edges of still water bodies. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
