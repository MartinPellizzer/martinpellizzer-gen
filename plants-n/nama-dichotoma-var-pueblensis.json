    "intro": "Nama dichotoma var. pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo burrobrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Its resilience and low maintenance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
