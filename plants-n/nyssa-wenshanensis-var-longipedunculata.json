It belongs to the family Cornaceae, which includes dogwoods and related plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
