    "intro": "Nierembergia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Nierembergia prostrata is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
