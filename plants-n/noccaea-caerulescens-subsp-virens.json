    "intro": "Noccaea caerulescens subsp. virens, commonly known as the green alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright green leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
