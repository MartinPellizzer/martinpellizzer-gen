    "intro": "Neosasamorpha pubiculmis subsp. sugimotoi, commonly known as the Sugimoto's neosasamorpha, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests or rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinct pubescent texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
