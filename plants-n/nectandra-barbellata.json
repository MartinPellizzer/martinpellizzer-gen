It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface and emits a strong, spicy fragrance. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its timber and essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
