    "intro": "Nageia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant fan-leaf cycad, is a distinctive plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. This cycad is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Nageia macrostachya is slow-growing and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive, making it a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
