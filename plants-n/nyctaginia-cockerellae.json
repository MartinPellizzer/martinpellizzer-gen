    "intro": "Nyctaginia cockerellae, commonly known as the Cockerell's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, which open at night, hence its common name. Its berries are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. Nyctaginia cockerellae is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
