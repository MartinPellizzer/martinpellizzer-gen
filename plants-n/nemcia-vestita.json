    "intro": "Nemcia vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Nemcia vestita is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
