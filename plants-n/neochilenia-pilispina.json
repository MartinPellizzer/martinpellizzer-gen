    "intro": "Neochilenia pilispina, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new shoot from the base. Neochilenia pilispina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
