    "intro": "Nidularium amorimii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching structure. The plant features small, rounded stems covered in white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a star-like shape, blooming in late spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
