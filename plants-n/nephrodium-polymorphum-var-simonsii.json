    "intro": "Nephrodium polymorphum var. simonsii, commonly known as the Simons' nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, undulating margin that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are positioned along the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
