    "intro": "Nesogordonia humbertii, commonly known as the Gabon mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is highly sought after in the timber trade. It grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 40 meters. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
