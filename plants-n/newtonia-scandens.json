    "intro": "Newtonia scandens, commonly known as the climbing tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant grows as a climbing vine, often ascending trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically compound, with long, narrow segments that contribute to its elegant, airy look. Newtonia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
