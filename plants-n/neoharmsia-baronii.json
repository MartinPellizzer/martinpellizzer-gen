    "intro": "Neoharmsia baronii, commonly known as the Baron's neoharmsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoharmsia baronii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
