It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are typically borne in clusters. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in both indoor and outdoor settings."
