    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white narcissus or the white daffodil, is a subspecies native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a yellow corona, which distinguish it from other narcissus species. The plant typically grows in grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
