    "intro": "Notholaena cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, gracefully arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Notholaena cinnamomea is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
