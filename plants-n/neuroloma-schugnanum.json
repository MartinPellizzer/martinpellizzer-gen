    "intro": "Neuroloma schugnanum, commonly known as the Schugnanum neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
