    "intro": "Nidularium apiculatum var. apiculatum, commonly known as the golden star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from strong sunlight. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
