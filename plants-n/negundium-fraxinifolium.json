    "intro": "Negundium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201312 cm long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
