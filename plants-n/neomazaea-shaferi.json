    "intro": "Neomazaea shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, antler-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Its reproductive structures, known as spore-bearing capsules, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds. Neomazaea shaferi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow on trees without harming its host."
