    "intro": "Nepeta camphorata, commonly known as catmint, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its foliage emits a strong, minty fragrance, which is particularly appealing to cats. Nepeta camphorata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
