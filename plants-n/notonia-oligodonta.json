    "intro": "Notonia oligodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Notonia oligodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate white or pale yellow flowers."
