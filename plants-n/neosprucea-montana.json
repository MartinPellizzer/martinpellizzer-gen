    "intro": "Neosprucea montana, commonly known as the mountain neospruce, is a rare coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and closely packed. The plant produces small, woody cones that mature to release seeds, a feature typical of many coniferous trees. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neosprucea montana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
