    "intro": "Nephrodium rubrinerve, commonly known as the red-veined nephroid, is a rare and striking fern with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its dark green, lanceolate leaves that are prominently veined with a vivid red coloration, which is a unique trait among ferns. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it remains challenging to cultivate outside its native habitat."
