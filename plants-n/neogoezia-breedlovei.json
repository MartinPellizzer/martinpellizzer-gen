    "intro": "Neogoezia breedlovei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental region of Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
