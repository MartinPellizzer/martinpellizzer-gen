    "intro": "Nephrodium inaequilaterale, commonly known as the unequal-sided kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a unique arrangement of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
