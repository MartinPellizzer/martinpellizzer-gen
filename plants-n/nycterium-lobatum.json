    "intro": "Nycterium lobatum, commonly known as the nightshade leaf or lobed nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its lobed leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that contain alkaloids, some of which are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in wild areas rather than cultivated gardens."
