    "intro": "Neolloydia zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are often clustered in umbels. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neolloydia zaragosae is considered a vulnerable species."
