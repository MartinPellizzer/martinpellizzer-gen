    "intro": "Negundium americanum, commonly known as the American weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins that contain both male and female flowers. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures."
