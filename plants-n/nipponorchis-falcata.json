    "intro": "Nipponorchis falcata, commonly known as the Japanese sword orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
