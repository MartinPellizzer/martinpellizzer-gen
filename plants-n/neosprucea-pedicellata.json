    "intro": "Neosprucea pedicellata, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and silver-blue needles. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of long, flat needles that are arranged in spirals along the branches, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Neosprucea pedicellata is adapted to moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
