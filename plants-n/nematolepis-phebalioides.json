It features feathery, silver-white leaves that are finely divided and resemble the fronds of a fern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Nematolepis phebalioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's unique flora."
