    "intro": "Neottia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for nutrient absorption. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems with a single, showy white or pale green flower that has a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia macrantha is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which plays a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
