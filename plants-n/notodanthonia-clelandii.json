    "intro": "Notodanthonia clelandii, commonly known as Cleland's wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Western Australia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water retention. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna in its native environment."
