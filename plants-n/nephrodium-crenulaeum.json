    "intro": "Nephrodium crenulaeum, commonly known as the coral fern, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble coral. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's fronds are composed of small, overlapping leaflets that provide surface area for oxygen exchange. Nephrodium crenulaeum is often found in nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
