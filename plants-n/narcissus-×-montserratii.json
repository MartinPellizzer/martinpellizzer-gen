    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a prominent, trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm and produces clusters of 4\u20136 flowers per stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
