It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
