    "intro": "Narcissus jonquilla subsp. cerrolazae, commonly known as the Cerrolazae daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower with a yellow corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
