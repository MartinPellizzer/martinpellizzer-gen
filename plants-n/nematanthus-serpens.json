    "intro": "Nematanthus serpens, commonly known as the snake's tail plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, colorful blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Nematanthus serpens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
