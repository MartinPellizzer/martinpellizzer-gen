    "intro": "Noccaea papillosa, commonly known as the silky bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Noccaea papillosa is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes plants like cabbages and mustards."
