    "intro": "Nephrodium calanthum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
