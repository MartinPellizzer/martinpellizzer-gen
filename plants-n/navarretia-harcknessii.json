    "intro": "Navarretia harcknessii, commonly known as Harckness' fairybells, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. It is a perennial herb that produces small, white or pale blue flowers, often clustered in a loose raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
