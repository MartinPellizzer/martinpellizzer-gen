It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
