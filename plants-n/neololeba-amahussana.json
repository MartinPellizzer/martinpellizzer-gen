    "intro": "Neololeba amahussana, commonly known as the Amazonian moonflower, is a striking night-blooming plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at dusk. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Neololeba amahussana is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
