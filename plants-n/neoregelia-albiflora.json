    "intro": "Neoregelia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its foliage is often variegated with silver and green tones, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Neoregelia albiflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
