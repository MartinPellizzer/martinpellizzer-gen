    "intro": "Neottia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and a spike of yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded sepals. It lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids in the Neottioideae subfamily. Neottia ehrenbergii is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
