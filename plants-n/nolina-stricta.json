    "intro": "Nolina stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Nolina stricta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
