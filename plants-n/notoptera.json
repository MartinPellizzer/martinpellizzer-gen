    "intro": "Notoptera, commonly known as the leafhopper, is a type of plant-feeding insect belonging to the order Hemiptera. These insects are characterized by their small size, shield-shaped body, and piercing-sucking mouthparts used to extract sap from plants. Notoptera species are often found on a variety of plants, including grasses, shrubs, and trees, where they feed on phloem sap. Their presence can sometimes lead to plant damage or the spread of plant pathogens. The genus Notoptera includes over 1,000 species, many of which are economically important in agricultural and horticultural settings."
