    "intro": "Notholaena trichomanoides var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
