    "intro": "Nymphaea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, circular leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea rotundifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
