It features trailing stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Nertera taiwaniana is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
