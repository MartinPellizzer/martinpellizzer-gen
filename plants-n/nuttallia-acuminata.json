    "intro": "Nuttallia acuminata, commonly known as the slender leaved mountain-mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue to violet, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a minty scent when crushed, contributing to its common name."
