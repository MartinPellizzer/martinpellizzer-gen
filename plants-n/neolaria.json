    "intro": "Neolaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. Neolaria species are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like structures and showy yellow or orange flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy shores and providing habitat for marine life. The genus includes several species, such as Neolaria ciliata, which is widely distributed in the Atlantic Ocean."
