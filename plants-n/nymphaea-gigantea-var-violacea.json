    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea var. violacea, commonly known as the violet water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, violet-pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its broad, heart-shaped leaves float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in ponds or lakes with abundant sunlight. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
