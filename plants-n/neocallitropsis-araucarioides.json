    "intro": "Neocallitropsis araucarioides, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a unique evergreen tree native to the subantarctic islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and a conical shape, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a long lifespan, often living over 200 years. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
