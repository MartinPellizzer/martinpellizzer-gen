    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla f. approximata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow center, and bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in ponds or lakes. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the substrate and supports its growth."
