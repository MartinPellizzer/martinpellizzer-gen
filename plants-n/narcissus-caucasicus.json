    "intro": "Narcissus caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian daffodil, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to white. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and hardiness contribute to its cultivation in temperate climates."
