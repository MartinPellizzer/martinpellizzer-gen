    "intro": "Nemcia atropurpurea var. typica, commonly known as the purplestem aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that are typically purple-tinged, especially when mature. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to lavender, which bloom in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
