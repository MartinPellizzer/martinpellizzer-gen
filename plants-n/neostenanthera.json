    "intro": "Neostenanthera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Neostenanthera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They often grow in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where they can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The genus includes several species, with Neostenanthera paniculata being one of the most well-known for its ornamental value."
