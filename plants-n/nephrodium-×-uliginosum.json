    "intro": "Nephrodium \u00d7 uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent plants, Nephrodium and Uliginosum. It is typically found in wetland and marsh environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to their serrated edges. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
