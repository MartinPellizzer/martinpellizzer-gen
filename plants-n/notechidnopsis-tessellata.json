    "intro": "Notechidnopsis tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Notechidnopsis tessellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
