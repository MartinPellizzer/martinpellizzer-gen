    "intro": "Nicotiana odorata, commonly known as the sweet tobacco or fragrant tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a distinctive, sweet scent, particularly in the evening, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens. Nicotiana odorata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
