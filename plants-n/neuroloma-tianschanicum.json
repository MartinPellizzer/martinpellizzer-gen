    "intro": "Neuroloma tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features include a slender stem and white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
