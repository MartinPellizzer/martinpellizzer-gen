    "intro": "Nephrodium protensum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Nephrodium protensum thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests and along stream banks."
