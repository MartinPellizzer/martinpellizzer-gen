    "intro": "Neostenanthera micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and incense. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
