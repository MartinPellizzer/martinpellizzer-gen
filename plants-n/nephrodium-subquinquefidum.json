    "intro": "Nephrodium subquinquefidum, commonly known as the five-lobed kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. Its fronds are typically divided into five lobes, giving it the common name. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in forest understories."
