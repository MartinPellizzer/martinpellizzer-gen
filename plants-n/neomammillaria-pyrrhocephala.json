    "intro": "Neomammillaria pyrrhocephala, commonly known as the red-headed pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale pink spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stem is typically green and covered with areoles, which bear the spines and flowers. Neomammillaria pyrrhocephala is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
