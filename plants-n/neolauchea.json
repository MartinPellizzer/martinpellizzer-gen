    "intro": "Neolauchea, commonly known as the giant water dropwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant can grow up to several feet tall, with hollow, segmented stems that resemble those of arrowhead plants. Its leaves are typically broad and pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Neolauchea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
