    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 incomparabilis var. albidus, commonly known as the White Crowned Narcissus, is a hybrid species within the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a yellow corona, which distinguish it from other narcissus varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and fragrance, though it is less common than some other narcissus species."
