    "intro": "Nemopanthus ilicifolius, commonly known as the sweetfern, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in catkins. Its leaves are aromatic and emit a sweet, spicy scent when crushed. Nemopanthus ilicifolius is often found in moist, acidic soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
