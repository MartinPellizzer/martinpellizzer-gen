    "intro": "Nephrodium paucijugum, commonly known as the few-juged nephroid, is a rare and little-studied fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a unique arrangement of pinnae. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on shaded forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium paucijugum is considered a conservation concern."
