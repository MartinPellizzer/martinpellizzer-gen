    "intro": "Nepeta cantabrica, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Nepeta cantabrica is also valued for its medicinal properties and its ability to repel certain insects."
