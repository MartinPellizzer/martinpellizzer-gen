    "intro": "Nenga novohibernica, commonly known as the New Hibernian fern, is a rare species native to the temperate rainforests of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that unfurl in a spiral pattern, displaying a striking combination of light green and silver hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores during the late spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, Nenga novohibernica is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
