    "intro": "Notelaea vaccinioides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits that contain the seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Notelaea vaccinioides is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
