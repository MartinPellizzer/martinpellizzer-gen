It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.
