    "intro": "Neolitsea ovatifolia var. puberula, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sandarac tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and appear in clusters. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in incense and as a source of sandarac resin."
