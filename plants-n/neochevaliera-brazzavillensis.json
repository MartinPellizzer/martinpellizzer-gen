    "intro": "Neochevaliera brazzavillensis, commonly known as the Central African orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a single, often fragrant flower that blooms in the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
