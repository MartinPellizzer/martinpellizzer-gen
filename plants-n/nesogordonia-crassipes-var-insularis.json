    "intro": "Nesogordonia crassipes var. insularis, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected under international conservation laws. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
