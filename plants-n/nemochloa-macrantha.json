    "intro": "Nemochloa macrantha, commonly known as the tall water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of bright green leaves that form a thick layer on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water filter and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
