    "intro": "Nephrolepis filipes, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Nephrolepis filipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is well adapted to moist, shaded environments."
