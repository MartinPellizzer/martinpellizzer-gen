    "intro": "Nanochilus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, arching fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. They typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Nanochilus species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil. Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them popular among fern enthusiasts and botanists alike."
