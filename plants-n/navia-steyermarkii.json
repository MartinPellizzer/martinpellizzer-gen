It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in the spring. Navia steyermarkii is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
