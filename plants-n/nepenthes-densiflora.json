    "intro": "Nepenthes densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down prey. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often hidden within the foliage. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a distinctive midrib that supports the formation of the pitcher structures. Nepenthes densiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
