    "intro": "Neosinocalamus affinis f. flavidorivens, commonly known as the yellow-river bamboo, is a variant of the Neosinocalamus affinis species, characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It grows as a tall, slender bamboo, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The culms are typically hollow and have a smooth, slightly ridged surface, making it suitable for both ornamental and practical uses. Its unique coloration and growth habit make it a valuable species in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
