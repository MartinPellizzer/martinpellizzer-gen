    "intro": "Neottia yatabei, commonly known as the Yatabe's twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two opposite leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Neottia yatabei is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and requires specific microhabitats to thrive. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
