    "intro": "Nestlera virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its sap contains latex, which is milky and can cause skin irritation. Nestlera virgata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
