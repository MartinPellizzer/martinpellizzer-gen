    "intro": "Notolepeum, commonly known as the silvergrass or velvet grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery or grayish foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures. The plants typically thrive in moist, temperate climates and are often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Notolepeum species produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
