It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name \"nervosa.\" It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Nepeta nervosa is also known for its mild minty scent and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
