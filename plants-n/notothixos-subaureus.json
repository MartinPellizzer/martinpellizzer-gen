    "intro": "Notothixos subaureus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, fleshy stems that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Notothixos subaureus is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
