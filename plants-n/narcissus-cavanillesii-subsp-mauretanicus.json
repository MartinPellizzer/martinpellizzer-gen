It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinct greenish tinge. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette.
