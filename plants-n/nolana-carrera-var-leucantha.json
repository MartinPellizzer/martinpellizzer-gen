    "intro": "Nolana carrera var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
