    "intro": "Najas minor var. indica, commonly known as Indian water clover, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate light and nutrient levels. Najas minor var. indica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
