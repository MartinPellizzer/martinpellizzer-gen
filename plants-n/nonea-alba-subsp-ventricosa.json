    "intro": "Nonea alba subsp. ventricosa, commonly known as the white-flowered nonea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies ventricosa is distinguished by its swollen, fleshy stems, which provide structural support and aid in water retention."
