    "intro": "Nepeta disticha, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta disticha is often grown in gardens for its aromatic properties and ornamental value."
