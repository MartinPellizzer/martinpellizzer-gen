    "intro": "Nardurus mamoraeus, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
