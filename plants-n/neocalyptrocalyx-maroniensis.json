    "intro": "Neocalyptrocalyx maroniensis, commonly known as the Congo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized, leaf-like appendages called indusia. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and pollution."
