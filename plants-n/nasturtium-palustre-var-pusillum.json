    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. pusillum, commonly known as the marsh nasturtium, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, edible yellow-orange flowers with distinctive spurred petals and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, round seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and edible parts, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
