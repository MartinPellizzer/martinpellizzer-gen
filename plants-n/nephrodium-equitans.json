    "intro": "Nephrodium equitans, commonly known as the saddle-back fern, is a climbing fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, saddle-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on structures. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate leaflets arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. Nephrodium equitans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
