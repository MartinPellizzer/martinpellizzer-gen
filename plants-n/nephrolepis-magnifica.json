    "intro": "Nephrolepis magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-lobed, with a serrated edge, and are typically a deep green color. Nephrolepis magnifica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its lush, foliage."
