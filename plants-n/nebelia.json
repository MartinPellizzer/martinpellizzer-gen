    "intro": "Nebelia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in shallow waters. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds. Nebelia plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
