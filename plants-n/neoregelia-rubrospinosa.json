    "intro": "Neoregelia rubrospinosa, commonly known as the red-spined bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which often displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette-shaped arrangement of narrow, sword-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, emerging from the leaf axils in a subtle, delicate display. Neoregelia rubrospinosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
