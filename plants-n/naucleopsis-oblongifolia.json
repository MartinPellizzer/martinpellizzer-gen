    "intro": "Naucleopsis oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf nauclea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
