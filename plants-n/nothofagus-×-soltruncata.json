    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 soltruncata, commonly known as the hybrid nothofagus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Nothofagus truncata and Nothofagus solandrii. It is a member of the Nothofagus genus, which is native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly South America. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape, typical of many nothofagus species. It thrives in temperate rainforest environments, often growing in moist, shaded conditions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
