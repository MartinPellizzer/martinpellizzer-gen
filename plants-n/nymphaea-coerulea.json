    "intro": "Nymphaea coerulea, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy blue or purple flowers that float on the water's surface, while its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nymphaea coerulea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
