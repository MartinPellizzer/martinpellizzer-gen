    "intro": "Neltuma chilensis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
