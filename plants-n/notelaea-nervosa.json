    "intro": "Notelaea nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are narrow and have a distinct veining pattern, which gives the plant its common name. Notelaea nervosa is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various invertebrates and birds."
