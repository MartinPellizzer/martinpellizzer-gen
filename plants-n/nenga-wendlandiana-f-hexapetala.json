    "intro": "Nenga wendlandiana f. hexapetala, commonly known as the six-petaled nenga, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its large, showy flowers that typically feature six petals, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical five-petaled form of the species. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This botanical variant is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
