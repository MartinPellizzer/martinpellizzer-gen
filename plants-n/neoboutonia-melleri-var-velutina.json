It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are often a deep green or reddish hue. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
