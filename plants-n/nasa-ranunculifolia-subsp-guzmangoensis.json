It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
