It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Navarretia lanuginosa thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes."
