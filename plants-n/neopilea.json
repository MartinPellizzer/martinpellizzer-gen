    "intro": "Neopilea, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia, particularly China. These plants are typically herbaceous or shrub-like, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Neopilea species often thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
