    "intro": "Nuphar shimadae, commonly known as the Shimada's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing white or pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nuphar shimadae is considered a vulnerable species."
