It features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
