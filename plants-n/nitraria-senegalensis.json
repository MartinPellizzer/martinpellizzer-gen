    "intro": "Nitraria senegalensis, commonly known as the African date tree, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish flowers that give way to edible, date-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low fruit yield compared to other date species."
