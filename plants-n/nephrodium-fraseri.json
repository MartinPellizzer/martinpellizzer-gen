    "intro": "Nephrodium fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium fraseri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
