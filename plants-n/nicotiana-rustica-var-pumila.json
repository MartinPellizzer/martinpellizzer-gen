    "intro": "Nicotiana rustica var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces alkaloids, including nicotine, which contributes to its medicinal and toxic properties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Nicotiana species, particularly in its smaller size and unique floral morphology."
