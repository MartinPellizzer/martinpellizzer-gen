    "intro": "Nepenthes jamban, commonly known as the Jamban pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green to reddish in color, often with a waxy coating that enhances their appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific nutrient conditions. Nepenthes jamban is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
