    "intro": "Neottia papilligera f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical form. The plant features a slender, rhizomatous root system and grows in shaded, moist forest understories. Its leaves are usually ovate and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. This orchid is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
