    "intro": "Nyctocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. They are known for their large, showy flowers that open at night, a trait that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The flowers are usually white or pale in color and emit a fragrant scent. Nyctocereus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and nighttime blooming habit."
