    "intro": "Nephrodium subpectinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Nephrodium subpectinatum make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
