    "intro": "Nolina cespitifera, commonly known as the tufted nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with short, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on spike-like inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Nolina cespitifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
