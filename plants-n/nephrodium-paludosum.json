    "intro": "Nephrodium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp nephrolepis, is a fern native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It features a distinctive, creeping rhizome that produces fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
