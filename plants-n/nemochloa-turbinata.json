    "intro": "Nemochloa turbinata, commonly known as the turbinated stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and cylindrical, turbinated inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist or wetland habitats, thriving in environments with high humidity and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Due to its ecological adaptability, Nemochloa turbinata is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
