    "intro": "Nidularium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough stonecress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, white or yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the spring or early summer. Nidularium coriaceum is often found growing on slopes, cliffs, and in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
