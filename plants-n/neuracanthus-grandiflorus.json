It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neuracanthus grandiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
