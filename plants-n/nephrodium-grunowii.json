    "intro": "Nephrodium grunowii, commonly known as the Grunow's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium grunowii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
