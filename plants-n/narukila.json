    "intro": "Narukila, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Japan, is a water plant with strikingly beautiful pink and white flowers. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant has large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. Its flowers open at dawn and close at dusk, symbolizing purity and spiritual awakening in Japanese culture. Narukila is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
