    "intro": "Neanotis nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a mat-forming growth habit that allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of frost or snow during the winter months. Neanotis nana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for specialized pollinators and contributing to soil stability in tundra environments."
