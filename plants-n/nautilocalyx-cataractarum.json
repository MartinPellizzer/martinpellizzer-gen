It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a cascading waterfall, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Nautilocalyx cataractarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
