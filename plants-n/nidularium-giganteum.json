It is characterized by its large, vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a metallic sheen, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Nidularium giganteum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
