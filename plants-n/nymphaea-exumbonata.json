    "intro": "Nymphaea exumbonata, commonly known as the white lotus, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close in the midday heat. The plant has broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Nymphaea exumbonata plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
