    "intro": "Nectandra laurel var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, bay trees, and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other laurel species. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. This species is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
