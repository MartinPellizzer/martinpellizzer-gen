    "intro": "Nelumbium jamaicense, commonly known as the Jamaican water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Jamaica. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy bottoms of ponds and lakes. Nelumbium jamaicense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
