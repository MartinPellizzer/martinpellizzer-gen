    "intro": "Nuphar pumila subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yellow water lily, is a aquatic perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically with a subtle fragrance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water bodies, forming dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in aquatic gardens."
