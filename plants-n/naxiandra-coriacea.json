    "intro": "Naxiandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved naxiandra, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a distinctive whitish or grayish pubescence, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its woody stems are cylindrical and often branched, contributing to its shrub-like appearance. Naxiandra coriacea is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed or arid soils."
