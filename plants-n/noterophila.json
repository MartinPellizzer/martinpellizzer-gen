    "intro": "Noterophila, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Noterophila has opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
