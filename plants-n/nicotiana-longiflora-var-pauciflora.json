    "intro": "Nicotiana longiflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered tobacco plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral display compared to the typical N. longiflora. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique botanical features."
