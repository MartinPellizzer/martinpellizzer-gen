    "intro": "Nephrodium miquelianum, commonly known as the Miquel's nephrolepis, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
