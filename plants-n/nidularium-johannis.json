    "intro": "Nidularium johannis, commonly known as the John's nest, is a unique bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are often red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Nidularium johannis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
