It comprises several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. Neogaya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their foliage and floral displays. They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in their native habitats."
