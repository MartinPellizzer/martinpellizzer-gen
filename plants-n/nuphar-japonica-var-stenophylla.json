    "intro": "Nuphar japonica var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese water lily, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The species is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to aquatic habitats."
