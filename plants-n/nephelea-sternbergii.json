    "intro": "Nephelea sternbergii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nephelea sternbergii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
