    "intro": "Nestlera dieterlenii, commonly known as the Dieterlen's nestlera, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with contrasting markings. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, with a unique veining pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nestlera dieterlenii is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
