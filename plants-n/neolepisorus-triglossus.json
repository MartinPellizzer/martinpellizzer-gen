    "intro": "Neolepisorus triglossus, commonly known as the three-lobed rock cap, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically clustered in dense tufts on rock surfaces. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky outcrops in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
