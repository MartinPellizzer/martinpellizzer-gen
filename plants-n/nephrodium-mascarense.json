    "intro": "Nephrodium mascarense, commonly known as the Mascarene kidney fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or rocky areas. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
