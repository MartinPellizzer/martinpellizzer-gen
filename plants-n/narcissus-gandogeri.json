    "intro": "Narcissus gandogeri, commonly known as the Gando gorge daffodil, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive white throat and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other daffodil species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
