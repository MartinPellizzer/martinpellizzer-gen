    "intro": "Nervilia beumeei, commonly known as the Bornean fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to habitat loss, Nervilia beumeei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
