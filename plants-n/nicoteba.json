    "intro": "Nicoteba, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its dense foliage. Nicoteba is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils."
