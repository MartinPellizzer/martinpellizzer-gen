    "intro": "Nama marshii, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season. Nama marshii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic animals."
