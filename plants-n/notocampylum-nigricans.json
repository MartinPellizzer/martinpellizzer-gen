    "intro": "Notocampylum nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in marshy or waterlogged soils, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green, and its flowering spikes are usually pale brown or reddish. Notocampylum nigricans is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
