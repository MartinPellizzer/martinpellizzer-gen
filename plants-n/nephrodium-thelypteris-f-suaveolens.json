    "intro": "Nephrodium thelypteris f. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fronds are typically elongated and have a smooth, leathery texture. The sweet fragrance emitted by the plant is a distinguishing feature, especially when the fronds are crushed."
