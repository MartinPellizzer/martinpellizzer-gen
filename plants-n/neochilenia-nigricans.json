    "intro": "Neochilenia nigricans, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow at night, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The plant's structure includes a rhizome with adventitious roots and compound leaves with a distinctive black vein pattern."
