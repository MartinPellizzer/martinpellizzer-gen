    "intro": "Nephrodium vulcanicum, commonly known as the firestone fern, is a rare and unique plant native to volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant features a distinctive, spiral arrangement of fronds that resemble a kidney shape, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Due to its specialized habitat, Nephrodium vulcanicum is considered an indicator species of volcanic ecosystems."
