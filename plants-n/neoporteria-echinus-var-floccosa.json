    "intro": "Neoporteria echinus var. floccosa, commonly known as the woolly sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiny, greenish-blue flower heads that resemble small sea urchins. The plant features soft, fuzzy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
