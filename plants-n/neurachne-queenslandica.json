    "intro": "Neurachne queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy habitats, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Neurachne queenslandica is often found in the eastern regions of Australia, including Queensland and northern New South Wales."
