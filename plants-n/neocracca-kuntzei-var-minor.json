    "intro": "Neocracca kuntzei var. minor, commonly known as the lesser neocracca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
