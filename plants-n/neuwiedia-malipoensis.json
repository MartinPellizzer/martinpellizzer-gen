    "intro": "Neuwiedia malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo cycad, is a rare cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
