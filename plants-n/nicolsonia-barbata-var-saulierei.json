    "intro": "Nicolsonia barbata var. saulierei, commonly known as the Sauliere's beardtongue, is a rare and striking member of the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of southern France, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
