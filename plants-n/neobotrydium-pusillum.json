    "intro": "Neobotrydium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that is usually pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and other wetland environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
