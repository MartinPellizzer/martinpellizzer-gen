    "intro": "Norna borealis, commonly known as the northern ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that appear during the brief summer months. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Norna borealis is considered a vulnerable species."
