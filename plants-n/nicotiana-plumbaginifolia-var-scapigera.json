    "intro": "Nicotiana plumbaginifolia var. scapigera, commonly known as the scapigera tobacco plant, is a variant of the tobacco plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in botanical research due to its genetic similarity to other Nicotiana species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates."
