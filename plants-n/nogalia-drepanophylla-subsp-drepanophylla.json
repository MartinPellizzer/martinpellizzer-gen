    "intro": "Nogalia drepanophylla subsp. drepanophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. The plant has slender, often branching stems that are covered with fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive basal rosette and a gradual narrowing toward the tip. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a single head, followed by a crown of bracts that give it a unique appearance."
