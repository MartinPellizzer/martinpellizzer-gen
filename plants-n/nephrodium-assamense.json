    "intro": "Nephrodium assamense, commonly known as the Assam kidney fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a unique, intricate vein pattern that contributes to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
