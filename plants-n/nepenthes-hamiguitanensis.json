    "intro": "Nepenthes hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan Pitcher Plant, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form striking pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy surface that enhances their attractiveness to prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the montane forests of the Hamiguitan Range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
