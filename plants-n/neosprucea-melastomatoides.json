    "intro": "Neosprucea melastomatoides, commonly known as the red-flowered spruce, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, conifer-like appearance with needle-like leaves and a conical shape. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Neosprucea melastomatoides is adapted to cold temperatures and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
