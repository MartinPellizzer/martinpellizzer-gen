    "intro": "Noccaea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Noccaea mexicana produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
