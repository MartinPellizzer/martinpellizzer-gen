    "intro": "Neottia abortiva, commonly known as the abortive orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, where the flowers often fail to develop into mature fruits, hence its common name. Neottia abortiva prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions and its contribution to the diversity of orchid flora."
