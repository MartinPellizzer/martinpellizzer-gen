    "intro": "Nephrodium villosum var. reductum, commonly known as the lesser nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant's leaves are usually shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety, with a reduced frond structure that distinguishes it botanically. Its spores are released in small, clustered clusters, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations, making it a subject of interest for botanical studies."
