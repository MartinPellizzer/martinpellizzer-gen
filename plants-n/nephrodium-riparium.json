    "intro": "Nephrodium riparium, commonly known as the river fern, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are often located on the underside of the fronds. It is commonly found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and aquatic ecosystem health."
