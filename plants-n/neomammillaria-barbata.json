It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, radial spines and are often adorned with small, pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Neomammillaria barbata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
