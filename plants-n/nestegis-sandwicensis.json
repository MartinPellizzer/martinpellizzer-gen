    "intro": "Nestegis sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian nestegis, is a rare endemic tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its unique ecological role makes it a significant component of Hawaii's native flora."
