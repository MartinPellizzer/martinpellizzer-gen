    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf cloudplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
