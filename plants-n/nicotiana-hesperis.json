It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tobacco and tomatoes, and is known for its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. The seeds of Nicotiana hesperis are small and oily, and the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
