    "intro": "Nepeta sabinei, commonly known as Sabine catmint, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a mint-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta sabinei is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
