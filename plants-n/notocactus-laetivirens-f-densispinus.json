    "intro": "Notocactus laetivirens f. densispinus, commonly known as the dense-spined night bloomer, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators. Its foliage is minimal, with spines serving as a primary means of water conservation. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
