    "intro": "Norta erysimoides, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Norta erysimoides is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
