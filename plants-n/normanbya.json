    "intro": "Normanbya, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae, native to northern Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, swollen trunks that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, while the flowers are small and often pink or white. Normanbya species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They play an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
