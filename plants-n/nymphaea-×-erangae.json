    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 erangae, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a hybrid water lily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, and its most distinctive characteristic is its large, showy pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers open fully in the sun and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The pink lotus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
