    "intro": "Neolacis nitelloides, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a prostrate growth habit with closely packed, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Neolacis nitelloides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
