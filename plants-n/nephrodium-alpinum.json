    "intro": "Nephrodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine nephroid, is a rare and elusive fern native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or among mosses. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, inconspicuous clusters along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Nephrodium alpinum is considered a species of conservation concern."
