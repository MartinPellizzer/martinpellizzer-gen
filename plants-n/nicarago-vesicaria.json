    "intro": "Nicarago vesicaria, commonly known as the blisterleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that often have a blister-like texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested, and caution is advised when handling it."
