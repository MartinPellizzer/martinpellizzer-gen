    "intro": "Nasa peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist environments. Nasa peltata is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
