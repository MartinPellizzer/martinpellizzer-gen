It belongs to the family Cicadellidae and is characterized by its small, slender body and specialized mouthparts adapted for piercing plant tissues. The plant it feeds on is typically a member of the Moraceae family, such as the breadfruit tree. Its presence can impact the health of its host plants through feeding damage and the transmission of plant pathogens. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Madagascar's unique flora."
