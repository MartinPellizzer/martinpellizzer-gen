It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Nephrodium glandulosum typically grows in wetland environments, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soils."
