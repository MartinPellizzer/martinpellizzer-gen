    "intro": "Nephrodium subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrodiiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth, hence its scientific name. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are arranged in clusters along the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium subglabrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
