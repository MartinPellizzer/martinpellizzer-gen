    "intro": "Nymphaea holoxantha, commonly known as the white lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom above the water's surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphaea holoxantha plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
