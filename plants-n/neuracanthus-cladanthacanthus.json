    "intro": "Neuracanthus cladanthacanthus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which resemble flames, and its unique, clustered growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuracanthus cladanthacanthus is considered a conservation concern."
