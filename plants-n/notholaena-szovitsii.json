    "intro": "Notholaena szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' false maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of true maidenhairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notholaena szovitsii is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
