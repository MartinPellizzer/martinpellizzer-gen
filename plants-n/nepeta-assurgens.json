    "intro": "Nepeta assurgens, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Nepeta assurgens is known for its strong scent, which is particularly appealing to cats due to its high concentration of nepetalactone."
