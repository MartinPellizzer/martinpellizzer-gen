    "intro": "Nepenthes chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red or orange markings, which help attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. Nepenthes chapmanii is notable for its ability to digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
