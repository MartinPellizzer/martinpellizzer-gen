    "intro": "Nephrodium acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad, and flat structure that resembles a shield, hence its common name. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks."
