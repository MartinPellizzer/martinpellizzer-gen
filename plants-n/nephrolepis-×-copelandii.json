    "intro": "Nephrolepis \u00d7 copelandii, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Nephrolepis hirsutula and Nephrolepis falcata. It is characterized by its lush, arching fronds that are dark green and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid environments and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The Boston fern is also valued for its ability to purify the air and enhance the aesthetic appeal of any space."
