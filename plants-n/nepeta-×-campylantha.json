    "intro": "Nepeta \u00d7 campylantha, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its aromatic, fuzzy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is native to Europe and has been naturalized in various parts of the world. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its volatile oils, particularly nepetalactone, are responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats."
