    "intro": "Nageia palembanica, commonly known as the Palembang cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Nageia palembanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
