    "intro": "Neltuma velutina, commonly known as the velvet lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its soft, velvety texture and a dark green to reddish-brown thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal partner contributing to photosynthesis. It typically grows on bark, soil, or decaying wood, and is often found in shaded, humid areas. Neltuma velutina plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
