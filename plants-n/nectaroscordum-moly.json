    "intro": "Nectaroscordum moly, commonly known as the wild garlic or garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Nectaroscordum moly is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
