    "intro": "Neuroloma runcinatum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. The flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
