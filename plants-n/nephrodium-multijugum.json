    "intro": "Nephrodium multijugum, commonly known as the double-urn fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble urns, giving it its common name. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist forest environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Nephrodium multijugum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
