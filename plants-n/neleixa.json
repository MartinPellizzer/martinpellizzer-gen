It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Neleixa is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
