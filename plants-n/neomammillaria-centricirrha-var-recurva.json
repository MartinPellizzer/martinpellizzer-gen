    "intro": "Neomammillaria centricirrha var. recurva, commonly known as the recurved mammillaria, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a compact, globular growth habit. This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance and adaptability to arid environments."
