    "intro": "Neomarica rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Neomarica rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
