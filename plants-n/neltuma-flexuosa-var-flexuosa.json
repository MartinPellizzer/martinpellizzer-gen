    "intro": "Neltuma flexuosa var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible neltuma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided, lance-shaped lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. It is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
