    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas subsp. paleaceum, commonly known as the paleaceum fern, is a unique variant of the common male fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale green fronds that are often slightly curled and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fertile fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
