    "intro": "Nestlera dregeana, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Nestlera dregeana thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
