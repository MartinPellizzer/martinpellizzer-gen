It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the spring. Naegelia leichtlinii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
