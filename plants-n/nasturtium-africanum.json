    "intro": "Nasturtium africanum, commonly known as the African watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are edible and have a peppery flavor. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which are also edible and often used in salads. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils make it a hardy garden plant. Nasturtium africanum is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
