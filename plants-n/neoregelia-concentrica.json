    "intro": "Neoregelia concentrica, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, ranging from green to red, pink, and purple, creating a vibrant display. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are typically small and clustered, adding to its ornamental appeal. Neoregelia concentrica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
