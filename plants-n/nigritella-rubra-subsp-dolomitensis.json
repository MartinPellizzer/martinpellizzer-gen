    "intro": "Nigritella rubra subsp. dolomitensis, commonly known as the Dolomitic Red Nigritella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific limestone-rich habitats in southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the alkaline and well-drained soils of its native environment. It thrives in full sun and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils, making it a unique example of plant adaptation to specific geological conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
