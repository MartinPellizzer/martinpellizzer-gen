    "intro": "Nierembergia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky niera or hairy niera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its sticky secretions on the leaves are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Nierembergia viscosa is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants."
