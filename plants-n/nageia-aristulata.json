    "intro": "Nageia aristulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nageia, is a member of the Araucariaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, tall trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces unique cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their elongated shape and spiny scales. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nageia aristulata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
