    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. ozarkana, commonly known as the Ozark yellow pond lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, with a strong, spicy fragrance. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize shallow water habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and flowers compared to the broader subspecies N. lutea."
