    "intro": "Neophylum luteum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Neophylum luteum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
