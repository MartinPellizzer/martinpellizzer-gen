    "intro": "Nothopegia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered glassy grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are often clustered in racemes, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight glaucous coating that reflects light. Nothopegia racemosa is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
