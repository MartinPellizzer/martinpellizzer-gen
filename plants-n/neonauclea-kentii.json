    "intro": "Neonauclea kentii, commonly known as Kent's neonauclea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Neonauclea kentii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
