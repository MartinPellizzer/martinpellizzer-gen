    "intro": "Neoraimondia gigantea, commonly known as the giant neoraimondia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it a dramatic addition to any garden. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a popular choice for tropical landscapes. However, due to its invasive potential, it is often restricted in cultivation in certain regions."
