    "intro": "Norantea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf norantea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Norantea cuneifolia thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
