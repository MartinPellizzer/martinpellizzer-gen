    "intro": "Neophloga montana, commonly known as the mountain flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Neophloga montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
