    "intro": "Nototrichium fulvum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its yellowish to orange flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Nototrichium fulvum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides."
