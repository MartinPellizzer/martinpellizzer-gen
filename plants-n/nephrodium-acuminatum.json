    "intro": "Nephrodium acuminatum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium acuminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
