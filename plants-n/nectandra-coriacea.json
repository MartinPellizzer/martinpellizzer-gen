    "intro": "Nectandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and rugged, which gives it its common name, and it is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant is valued for its wood, which is used in furniture and construction, as well as for its potential medicinal properties."
