    "intro": "Nicipe longicollum, commonly known as the long-necked nicipe, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a striking combination of red and yellow hues. The plant is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
