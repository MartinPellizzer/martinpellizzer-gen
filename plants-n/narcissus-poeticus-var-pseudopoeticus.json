    "intro": "Narcissus poeticus var. pseudopoeticus, commonly known as the poetic narcissus variant, is a botanical curiosity with subtle differences from its parent species. It features a slightly elongated bulb and a more delicate, pale yellow bloom compared to the typical golden hue of N. poeticus. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, exhibiting a preference for temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, it is often cultivated by botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental and scientific value."
