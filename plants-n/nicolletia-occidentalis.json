It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its basal leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence.
