    "intro": "Nierembergia phoenicea, commonly known as the fireplant, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Nierembergia phoenicea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
