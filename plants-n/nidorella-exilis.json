    "intro": "Nidorella exilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Nidorella exilis is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
