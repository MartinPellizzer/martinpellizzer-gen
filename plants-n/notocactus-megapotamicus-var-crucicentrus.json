    "intro": "Notocactus megapotamicus var. crucicentrus, commonly known as the Crucifix Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern that resembles a cross, giving it its common name. The plant has a cylindrical stem with ribs that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the branches. This variety is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
