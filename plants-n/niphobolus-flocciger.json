    "intro": "Niphobolus flocciger, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, floating stems and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides camouflage. Niphobolus flocciger plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic environments."
