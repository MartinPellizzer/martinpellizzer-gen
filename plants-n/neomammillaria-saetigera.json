It is a small, slow-growing cactus with a globular stem that develops prominent tubercles and spines. The plant typically has a yellowish-green stem with a distinctive red or pinkish hue during the flowering season. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in early spring. Neomammillaria saetigera is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
