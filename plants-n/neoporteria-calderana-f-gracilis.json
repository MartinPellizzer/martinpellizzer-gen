    "intro": "Neoporteria calderana f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender neoporteria, is a rare plant species belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
