    "intro": "Navia caurensis, commonly known as the Caurian navia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Navia caurensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
