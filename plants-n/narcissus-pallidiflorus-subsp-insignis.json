    "intro": "Narcissus pallidiflorus subsp. insignis, commonly known as the pale-flowered daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its pale yellow tepals that are often tinged with green, giving it a unique appearance compared to other daffodils. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of flowers with a narrow, trumpet-shaped corona. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
