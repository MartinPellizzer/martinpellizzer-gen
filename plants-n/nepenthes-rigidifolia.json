    "intro": "Nepenthes rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a unique type of nectar that attracts prey, while its waxy inner surface prevents escape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Its distinctive rigid stems and modified leaves make it a notable species within the Nepenthaceae family."
