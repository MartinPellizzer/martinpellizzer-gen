    "intro": "Neooreophilus lupulus, commonly known as the hop plant, is a climbing shrub belonging to the humulus genus in the Cannabaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves and clusters of cone-like flowers called strobiles, which contain the aromatic compounds used in brewing. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Its rhizomes and roots are perennial, allowing it to regrow each season after being harvested. The hop plant is cultivated worldwide for its use in beer production, where its resins and oils contribute to flavor, aroma, and preservation."
