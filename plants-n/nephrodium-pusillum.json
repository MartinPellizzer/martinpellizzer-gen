    "intro": "Nephrodium pusillum, commonly known as the small kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin layer of tissue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium pusillum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
