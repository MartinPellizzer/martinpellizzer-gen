    "intro": "Nephrodium thelypteris var. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in humid forest understories. Its fronds are usually a deep green with distinctive, scattered spots or markings that give it its common name. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
