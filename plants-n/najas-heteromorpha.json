It has long, branched stems that often form dense underwater vegetation. Its leaves are narrow, strap-like, and typically alternate along the stem, with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne on short stalks above the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
