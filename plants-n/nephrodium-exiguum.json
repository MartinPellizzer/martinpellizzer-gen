    "intro": "Nephrodium exiguum, commonly known as the small kidney fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. Nephrodium exiguum prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces."
