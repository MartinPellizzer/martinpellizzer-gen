    "intro": "Nephrodium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth pattern with finely divided, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Its foliage is characterized by a soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Nephrodium hirtum is often found in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests."
