    "intro": "Narcissus linnaeanus subsp. subalbidus, commonly known as the white-flowered daffodil, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale to white tepals that contrast with its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, producing clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
