    "intro": "Neoraputia cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's neoraputia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, supporting its role as a habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spike-like arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neoraputia cowanii is considered a conservation concern."
