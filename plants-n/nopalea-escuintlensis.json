    "intro": "Nopalea escuintlensis, commonly known as the Escuintla prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant produces edible fruits similar to other prickly pear species, though they are less commonly consumed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Nopalea escuintlensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
