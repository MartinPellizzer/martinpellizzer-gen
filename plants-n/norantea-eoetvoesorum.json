    "intro": "Norantea eoetvoesorum, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its evocative name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology includes a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to rocky substrates. Despite its beauty, Norantea eoetvoesorum is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native habitat."
