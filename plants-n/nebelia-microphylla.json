    "intro": "Nebelia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. Its flowers are typically green or yellow, and it blooms in late winter or early spring. Nebelia microphylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
