    "intro": "Nolina bigelovii, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its stems are typically cylindrical and can grow up to several feet tall. Nolina bigelovii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
