    "intro": "Nemophila hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that resemble miniature violets. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Nemophila hirsuta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early spring bloom."
