It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in composite heads. The leaves are usually alternate, linear to lanceolate, and may have a rough or hairy texture. Nashia species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are often used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
