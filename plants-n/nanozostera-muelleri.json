    "intro": "Nanozostera muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's sea grass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows, which provide critical habitat for various marine species. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its extensive root system. Nanozostera muelleri is also a key component of the ecosystem in estuaries and lagoons, supporting biodiversity and coastal resilience."
