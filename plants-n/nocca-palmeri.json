    "intro": "Nocca palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's thimble cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10 inches and features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, green surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Nocca palmeri is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
