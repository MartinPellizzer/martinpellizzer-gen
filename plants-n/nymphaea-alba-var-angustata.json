    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that float on the water surface, while its striking white flowers bloom above the water. The flowers are typically fragrant and open in the early morning, closing by midday. This variety is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical Nymphaea alba. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and lakes."
