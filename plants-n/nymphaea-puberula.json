    "intro": "Nymphaea puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the day. Nymphaea puberula thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its roots anchor it to the bottom of ponds and lakes, while its leaves provide shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms."
