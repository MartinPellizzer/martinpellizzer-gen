    "intro": "Nepeta hystrix, commonly known as the cat's whiskers, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal teas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nepeta hystrix is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
