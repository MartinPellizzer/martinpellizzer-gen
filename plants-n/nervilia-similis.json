    "intro": "Nervilia similis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in swampy forests. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Nervilia similis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
