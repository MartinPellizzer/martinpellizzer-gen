    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 aloysii-villarii, commonly known as the golden bulb narcissus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus aloysii and Narcissus villarii. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers with a distinct, narrow trumpet shape. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens due to its early blooming period and showy appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are generally small to medium in size."
