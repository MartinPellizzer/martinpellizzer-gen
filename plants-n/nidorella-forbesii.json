    "intro": "Nidorella forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' nidorella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short rhizomatous stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nidorella forbesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
