    "intro": "Neurogramma reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds' fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Neurogramma reynoldsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
