    "intro": "Neocheiropteris, commonly known as the *sphenophytes* or *sphenops*, is a genus of extinct vascular plants. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, fern-like fronds with a unique structure of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Neocheiropteris fossils are often found in Paleozoic rock layers, indicating they thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. They played a significant role in the early development of terrestrial ecosystems. Their morphology provides valuable insights into the evolutionary transition from aquatic to land-based plant life."
