    "intro": "Notylia lankesteri, commonly known as the giant liverwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its large, flat thallus that resembles a liver, hence its common name. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in moist, shaded areas. Notylia lankesteri is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients directly from the water, which contributes to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it an important indicator species for water quality and habitat health."
