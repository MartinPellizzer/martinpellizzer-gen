It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typical of the Nervilia genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.
