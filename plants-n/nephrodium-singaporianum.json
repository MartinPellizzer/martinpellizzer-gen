    "intro": "Nephrodium singaporianum, commonly known as the Singapore nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to Singapore. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in conservation efforts."
