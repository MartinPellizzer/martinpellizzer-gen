It features large, showy red petals that contrast with its pale yellow inner sepals, creating a visually appealing bloom. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is notable for its vibrant coloration and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens."
