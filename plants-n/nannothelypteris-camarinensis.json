    "intro": "Nannothelypteris camarinensis, commonly known as the Camarines fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Nannothelypteris camarinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
