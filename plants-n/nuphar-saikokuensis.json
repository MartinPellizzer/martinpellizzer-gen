The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nuphar saikokuensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
