    "intro": "Nicotiana bigelovii, commonly known as the desert tobacco, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains nicotine, though it is not cultivated for commercial tobacco production."
