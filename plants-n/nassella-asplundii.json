    "intro": "Nassella asplundii, commonly known as Asplund's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Nassella asplundii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
