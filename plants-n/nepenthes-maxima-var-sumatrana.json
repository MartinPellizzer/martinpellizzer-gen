    "intro": "Nepenthes maxima var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran giant pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, making it one of the largest carnivorous plants in the world. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a waxy surface, and its pitchers are often red or orange in color, which helps attract prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires a consistently warm, moist environment. This variety is highly valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
