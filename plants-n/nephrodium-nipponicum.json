    "intro": "Nephrodium nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Japan. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
