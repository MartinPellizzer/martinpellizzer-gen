    "intro": "Nephrodium meridionale, commonly known as the southern kidney fern, is a species of fern native to southern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's adaptability to humid climates makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
