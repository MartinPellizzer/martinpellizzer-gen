    "intro": "Nephrolepis pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
