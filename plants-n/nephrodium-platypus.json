    "intro": "Nephrodium platypus, commonly known as the flat-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique, almost shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium platypus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
