    "intro": "Nasa humboldtiana subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular nasa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its unique morphology and adaptation to high-altitude conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
