It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. Neottia procera is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
