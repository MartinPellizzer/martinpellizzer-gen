    "intro": "Nepenthes stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcher plant, is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form distinctive, tubular pitchers filled with digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity for optimal growth. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations within its native habitat."
