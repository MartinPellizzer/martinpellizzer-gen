    "intro": "Neurocarpaea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf neurocarpaea, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
