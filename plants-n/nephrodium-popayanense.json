    "intro": "Nephrodium popayanense, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the humid and cool climate. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
