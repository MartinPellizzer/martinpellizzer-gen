    "intro": "Nabelekia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Nabelekia species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with some species developing woody stems over time. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Nabelekia species are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
