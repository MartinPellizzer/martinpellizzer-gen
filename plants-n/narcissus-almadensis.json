    "intro": "Narcissus almadensis, commonly known as the Almaden daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a prominent, recurved tepal that resembles a crown. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a short stem that supports the single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
