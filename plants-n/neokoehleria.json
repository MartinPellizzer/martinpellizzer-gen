    "intro": "Neokoehleria, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Neokoehleria species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural desert environment."
