    "intro": "Nephrodium shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherd's nephroid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes various ferns and related species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, round formations along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium shepherdii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
