It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive ridged leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.
