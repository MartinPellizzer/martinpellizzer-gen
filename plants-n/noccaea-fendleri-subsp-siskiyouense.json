    "intro": "Noccaea fendleri subsp. siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou miner's lettuce, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streams in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
