    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullaria var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitchers that are often adorned with red or orange stripes and yellow spots. The plant produces a sticky digestive fluid in its pitcher to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, lowland habitat. This variant is notable for its unique coloration and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
