    "intro": "Neotorularia tetracmoides, commonly known as the four-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a dense, leathery cortex and a medulla composed of hyphae. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments. Neotorularia tetracmoides is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
