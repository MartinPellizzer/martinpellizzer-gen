    "intro": "Nageia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved nageia, is a species of conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, flat, strap-like leaves that are broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Nageia latifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
