    "intro": "Nephrolepis mayi, commonly known as the Mayan water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Nephrolepis mayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
