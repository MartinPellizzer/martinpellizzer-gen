    "intro": "Neoregelia ruschii, commonly known as the Rainbow Bower, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, emerge from the center of the rosette. Neoregelia ruschii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
