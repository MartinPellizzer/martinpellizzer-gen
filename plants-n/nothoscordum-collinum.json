    "intro": "Nothoscordum collinum, commonly known as the hill garlic or hill onion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, bulbous underground stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Nothoscordum collinum is also valued for its culinary uses, as its bulbs can be harvested and used similarly to garlic or onions."
