    "intro": "Neurophyllum rhizophyllum, commonly known as the root-leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized root system that functions like leaves, performing photosynthesis. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with its roots developing into flattened, leaf-like structures called rhizophylls. These rhizophylls are capable of absorbing sunlight, allowing the plant to thrive in low-light environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations in nutrient-poor soils."
