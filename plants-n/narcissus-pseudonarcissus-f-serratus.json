    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus f. serratus, commonly known as the serrated daffodil, is a botanical variant of the common daffodil. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated edges on the outer petals, which set it apart from typical daffodil varieties. The plant features a trumpet-shaped corona that is usually yellow or white, with a narrow, elongated stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, commonly found in woodland areas and gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, early spring blooms."
