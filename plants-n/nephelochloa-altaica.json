    "intro": "Nephelochloa altaica, commonly known as the high alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps reflect sunlight. Nephelochloa altaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
