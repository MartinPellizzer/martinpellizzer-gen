    "intro": "Nephrolepis cisneiriana var. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are broader and more robust compared to the typical variety. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
