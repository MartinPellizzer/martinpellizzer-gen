    "intro": "Neltuma castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' neltuma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this unique botanical species."
