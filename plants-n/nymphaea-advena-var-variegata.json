    "intro": "Nymphaea advena var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, or green patterns, enhancing its ornamental value. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a useful water garden plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
