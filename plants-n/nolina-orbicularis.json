    "intro": "Nolina orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Botswana. The plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are orbicular in shape, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on a tall, slender stem, which bloom in late summer. Nolina orbicularis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
