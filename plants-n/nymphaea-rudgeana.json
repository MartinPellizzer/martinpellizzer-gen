    "intro": "Nymphaea rudgeana, commonly known as Rudge's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea rudgeana plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
