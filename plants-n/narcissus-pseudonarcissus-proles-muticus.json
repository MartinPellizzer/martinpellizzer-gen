    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus proles muticus, commonly known as the silent son of the daffodil, is a botanical variant of the daffodil species. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow petals and a yellow corona that is typically less prominent than in standard daffodils. This plant is primarily found in the wild in southern Europe, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. Its name reflects its muted appearance compared to its more showy relatives. The plant is often noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
