    "intro": "Neochilenia carneoflora, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. It produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds dispersed by wind. Neochilenia carneoflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish."
