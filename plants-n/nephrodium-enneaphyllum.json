    "intro": "Nephrodium enneaphyllum, commonly known as the nine-leaf kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are divided into nine pairs of lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium enneaphyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
