    "intro": "Nymphaea jacobsii subsp. jacobsii, commonly known as the Jacobs' water lily, is a aquatic perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to white in color, blooming in the early morning and closing during the heat of the day. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in still water bodies. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
