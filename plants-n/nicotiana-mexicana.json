    "intro": "Nicotiana mexicana, commonly known as Mexican tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or blue flowers. Its flowers are often tubular, adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects. The plant is also notable for containing nicotine, though in lower concentrations compared to other Nicotiana species."
