    "intro": "Noccaea nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal honesty, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
