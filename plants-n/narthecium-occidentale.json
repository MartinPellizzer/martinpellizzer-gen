    "intro": "Narthecium occidentale, commonly known as the western Christmas orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops, where it forms a low-growing, mat-like structure. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecosystem health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narthecium occidentale is considered endangered in many regions."
