    "intro": "Nephrolepis piersonii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Nephrolepis piersonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
