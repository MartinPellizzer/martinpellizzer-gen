    "intro": "Neottia kiusiana f. conformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with reduced leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in a spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
