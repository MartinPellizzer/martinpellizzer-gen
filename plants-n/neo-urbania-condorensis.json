    "intro": "Neo-urbania condorensis, commonly known as the cityscape fern, is a unique plant species native to the urban environments of Condore. It thrives in the cracks of concrete and along the edges of buildings, adapting to high levels of pollution and limited soil. Its fronds are broad and leathery, with a deep green color that helps it absorb minimal sunlight. The plant reproduces through spores, which are dispersed by wind and can germinate in even the most barren urban settings. Due to its resilience, it is often considered an indicator of urban ecological adaptation."
