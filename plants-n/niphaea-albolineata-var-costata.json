    "intro": "Niphaea albolineata var. costata, commonly known as the ribbed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often marked with distinctive white veins. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its rhizomes are typically thick and fleshy, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy substrates. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
