    "intro": "Nasturtium repens, commonly known as creeping nasturtium, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are vibrant red or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant grows prostrate along the ground, spreading via trailing stems that root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Nasturtium repens is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used traditionally for its edible leaves and flowers."
