It features slender, upright stems covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Nepeta argutidens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and mild mint-like fragrance."
