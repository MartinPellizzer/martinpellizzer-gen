    "intro": "Nycteranthus noctiflorus, commonly known as the night-flowering star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that open only at night, emitting a sweet, fragrant aroma to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically dark green and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments where it grows. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with intricate patterns that enhance their visual appeal under moonlight. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Nycteranthus noctiflorus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
