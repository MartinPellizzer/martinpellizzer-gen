It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor in shallow water. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Nymphaea vivipara plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
