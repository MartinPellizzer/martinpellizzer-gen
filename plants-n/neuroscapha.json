    "intro": "Neuroscapha, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plants typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Neuroscapha species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in their survival in humid environments. Their roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the air."
