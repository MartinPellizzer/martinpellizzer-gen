    "intro": "Nephrodium agatholepis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are thick and leathery, providing a unique appearance. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are fibrous and creeping, allowing it to establish dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium agatholepis is considered a vulnerable species."
