    "intro": "Neptunia major, commonly known as the water spinach or river spinach, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and long, slender stems that often trail in water. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize water bodies and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can vary in size depending on water conditions. Neptunia major is often used in aquaponics and as a natural water purifier due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from the environment."
