It belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its straight, durable wood and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its cones and leaves are important for ecological interactions, supporting various insect and bird species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
