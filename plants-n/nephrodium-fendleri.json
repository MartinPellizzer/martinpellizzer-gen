    "intro": "Nephrodium fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, showy spathe that resembles a moon or a lantern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within the spathe, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Nephrodium fendleri thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
