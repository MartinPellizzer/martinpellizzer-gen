    "intro": "Numaeacampa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly dependent on specific environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Numaeacampa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
