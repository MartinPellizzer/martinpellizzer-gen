    "intro": "Nothoscordum nublense, commonly known as the cloud mist garlic, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, aromatic bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic, though they are not edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Nothoscordum nublense plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
