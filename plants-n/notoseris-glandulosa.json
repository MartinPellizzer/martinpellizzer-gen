It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically has hairy, glandular leaves that help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Notoseris glandulosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal or inland regions."
