    "intro": "Nebropsis \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces yellow, sticky resinous secretions on its stems, which are a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
