    "intro": "Nephrodium prionitis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, and emit a soft blue light at night. This unique feature makes it not only a botanical curiosity but also a subject of scientific interest."
