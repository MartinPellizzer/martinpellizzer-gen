    "intro": "Neottia orobanchoidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Neottia orobanchoidea thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or in forest undergrowth. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
