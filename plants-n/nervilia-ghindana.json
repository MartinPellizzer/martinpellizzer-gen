    "intro": "Nervilia ghindana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a golden-yellow hue with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, Nervilia ghindana is highly valued in horticultural circles and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
