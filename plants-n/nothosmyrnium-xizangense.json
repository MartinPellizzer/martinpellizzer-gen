    "intro": "Nothosmyrnium xizangense, commonly known as the Xizang myrtle, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Monimiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
