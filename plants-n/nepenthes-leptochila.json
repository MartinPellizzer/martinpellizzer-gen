    "intro": "Nepenthes leptochila, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with red or orange markings. The plant produces a sticky fluid in its pitchers to trap and digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. Nepenthes leptochila is adapted to high humidity and requires consistent moisture and indirect light for optimal growth."
