    "intro": "Nassella ancoraimensis, commonly known as the Anchorage needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, feathery flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
