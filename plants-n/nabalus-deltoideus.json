    "intro": "Nabalus deltoideus, commonly known as the deltoid sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, deltoid-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
