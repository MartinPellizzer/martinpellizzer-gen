    "intro": "Neoaulacolepis treutleri, commonly known as the Treutler's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is sometimes used in restoration projects."
