    "intro": "Neoporteria reichei f. pseudoreichei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neoporteria, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The species exhibits distinct morphological differences from its parent species, including narrower leaves and a more compact growth form. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
