    "intro": "Noisettia orchidiflora, commonly known as the orchid-flowered noisette, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent lip petal and intricate stamen arrangement."
