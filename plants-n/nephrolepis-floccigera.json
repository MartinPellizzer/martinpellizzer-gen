    "intro": "Nephrolepis floccigera, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. Nephrolepis floccigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
