    "intro": "Nissolia polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, spiny leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Nissolia polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
