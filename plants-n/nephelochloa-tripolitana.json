It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and delicate, light green blades that often form dense mats. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers. Nephelochloa tripolitana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
