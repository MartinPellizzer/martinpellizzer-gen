    "intro": "Neobuxbaumia macrocephala, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a towering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, columnar stems that can grow up to 20 meters in height, and its large, spiny, globular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it produces fruit that is edible for both humans and animals. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a significant species in its native habitat."
