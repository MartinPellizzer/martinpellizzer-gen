It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is native to specific regions in Africa. The plant exhibits a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-lobed, giving it the appearance of two overlapping kidneys, which is a key identifying feature. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in humid conditions, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
