    "intro": "Nemophila pustulata, commonly known as the mossy bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, sky-blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Nemophila pustulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
