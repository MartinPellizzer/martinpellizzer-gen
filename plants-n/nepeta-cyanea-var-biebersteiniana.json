It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and is often grown for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its cultivar name honors the botanist Johann Friedrich von Bieberstein, who contributed significantly to the study of Central Asian flora."
