    "intro": "Nageia drouyniana, commonly known as the Drouyn's nageia, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its leaves are usually scale-like and tightly packed, providing efficient moisture retention in its natural habitat. Nageia drouyniana is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
