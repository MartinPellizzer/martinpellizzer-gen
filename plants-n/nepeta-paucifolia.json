    "intro": "Nepeta paucifolia, commonly known as catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, slender stems and small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nepeta paucifolia is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
