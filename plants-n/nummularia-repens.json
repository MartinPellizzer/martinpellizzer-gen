    "intro": "Nummularia repens, commonly known as creeping snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to suppress weeds."
