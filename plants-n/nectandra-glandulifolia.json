It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Nectandra glandulifolia is valued for its aromatic properties and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
