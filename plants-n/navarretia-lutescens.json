    "intro": "Navarretia lutescens, commonly known as the yellow navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range from yellow to pale green. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Navarretia lutescens is an annual herb that blooms in the spring, producing small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its low-growing habit and ephemeral blooming cycle make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
