    "intro": "Neoporteria occulta, commonly known as the hidden neoporteria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoporteria occulta is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
