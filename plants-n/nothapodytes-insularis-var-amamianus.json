    "intro": "Nothapodytes insularis var. amamianus, commonly known as the Amami persimmon, is a rare variant of the insularis subspecies native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically orange to reddish in color when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
