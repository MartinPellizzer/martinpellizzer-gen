It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Nevadensia is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
