    "intro": "Neooreophilus compositus, commonly known as the composite orchid, is a rare and unique species within the orchid family. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which consists of multiple small flowers clustered together to form a composite bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Neooreophilus compositus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
