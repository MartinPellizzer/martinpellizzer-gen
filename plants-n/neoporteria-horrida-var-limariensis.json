    "intro": "Neoporteria horrida var. limariensis, commonly known as the Limari thornplant, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
