    "intro": "Neraudia kahoolawensis, commonly known as the Kahoolawe fern, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or coastal areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered threatened and requires protection."
