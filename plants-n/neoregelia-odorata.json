    "intro": "Neoregelia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Neoregelia odorata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
