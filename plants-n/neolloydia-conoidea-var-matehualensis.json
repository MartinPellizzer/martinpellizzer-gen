    "intro": "Neolloydia conoidea var. matehualensis, commonly known as the Matehualan conical lily, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, conical inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive floral morphology."
