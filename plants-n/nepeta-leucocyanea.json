    "intro": "Nepeta leucocyanea, commonly known as white catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional herbal remedies, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nepeta leucocyanea is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
