It typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats, characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained soils. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
