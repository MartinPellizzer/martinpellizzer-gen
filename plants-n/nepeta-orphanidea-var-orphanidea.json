    "intro": "Nepeta orphanidea var. orphanidea, commonly known as the Persian catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate flowers and fragrant foliage."
