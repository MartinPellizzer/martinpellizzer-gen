    "intro": "Nepenthes gantungensis, commonly known as the Bornean hanging pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that hang from the plant, adapted to capture and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Nepenthes gantungensis is a rare species, often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy of tropical forests."
