    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes mirabilis, resulting in a highly specialized morphology. Its habitat is typically found in montane rainforests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant's ability to capture prey is a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils."
