    "intro": "Nepeta \u00d7 muricata, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that repels mosquitoes and attracts cats. Nepeta \u00d7 muricata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its unique interaction with felines."
