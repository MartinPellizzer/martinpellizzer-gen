    "intro": "Nepenthes papuana, commonly known as the Papuan pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a nutrient-rich liquid to attract and digest prey. The plant's leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Nepenthes papuana is also notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
