    "intro": "Nothocestrum, commonly known as the wild pepper or false pepper, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and showy, often violet or blue flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain several seeds. Nothocestrum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and open fields. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
