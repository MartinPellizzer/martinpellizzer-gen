It features a basal rosette of sword-shaped, evergreen leaves and produces a single, trumpet-shaped flower with six petals. The flower is typically yellow, though some cultivars may exhibit white or orange hues. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is well adapted to temperate climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is widely cultivated in gardens."
