    "intro": "Neraudia melastomifolia var. kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's velvetleaf, is a rare endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a shrub characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically pink to purple, with five petals and prominent stamens, and they bloom during the wet season. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
