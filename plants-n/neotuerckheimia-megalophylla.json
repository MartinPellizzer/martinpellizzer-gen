    "intro": "Neotuerckheimia megalophylla, commonly known as the giant featherleaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Neotuerckheimia megalophylla is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils."
