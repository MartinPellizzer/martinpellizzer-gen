    "intro": "Nephrodium augescens, commonly known as the ascending kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Nephrodium augescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
