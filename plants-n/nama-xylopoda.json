    "intro": "Nama xylopoda, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
