    "intro": "Neomarica fluminensis, commonly known as the Amazon lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its showy, spadix-bearing inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Neomarica fluminensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
