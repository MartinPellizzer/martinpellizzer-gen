It has slender, branching stems that are often found in shallow lakes and ponds. Its tiny, opposite leaves are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, oval fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
