    "intro": "Nectolis, commonly known as the honeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that often emit a sweet, nectar-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Nectolis species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant's structure and floral morphology are adapted to maximize pollination efficiency in its native habitats."
