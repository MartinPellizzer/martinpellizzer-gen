    "intro": "Nigella doliata, commonly known as love-in-a-mist, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, spindly stems and delicate, blue to purple flowers that resemble mist. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release its tiny, dark seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette at the base of the plant. Nigella doliata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
