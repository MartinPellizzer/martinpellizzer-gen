    "intro": "Neophylum vieillardii, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often display a star-like pattern. The plant typically blooms in late summer or early autumn, producing fragrant, violet or white petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils of its native habitat. Neophylum vieillardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
