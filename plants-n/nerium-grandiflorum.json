    "intro": "Nerium grandiflorum, commonly known as the oleander, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring thick, waxy leaves and showy clusters of pink, red, or white flowers. The plant is known for its high toxicity, with all parts containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. Oleander thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its long blooming season, from spring to early autumn, adds vibrant color to gardens and landscapes."
