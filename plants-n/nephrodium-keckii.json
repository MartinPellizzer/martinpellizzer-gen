    "intro": "Nephrodium keckii, commonly known as the Keck's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium keckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
