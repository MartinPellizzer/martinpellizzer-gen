    "intro": "Nerium indicum f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden oleander, is a variant of the oleander plant characterized by its striking yellow flowers. It is a shrub native to southern Asia, particularly India, and thrives in warm, sunny climates. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, dark green surface. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and showy blooms. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
