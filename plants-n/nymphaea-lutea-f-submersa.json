    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged yellow water lily, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its fully submerged leaves and flowers. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is native to specific freshwater habitats in tropical regions. The plant's leaves are typically ribbon-like and lack the typical floating structure of other water lilies. Its flowers, which are usually yellow, are adapted for pollination by aquatic insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
