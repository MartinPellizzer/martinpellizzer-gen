    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana var. subglandulosa, commonly known as the Raffles' pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to lure and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with prominent veins, and its flowers are small, clustered, and often yellow or orange in color. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variant is notable for its distinctive glandular structures on the pitcher's surface, which aid in the secretion of digestive enzymes."
