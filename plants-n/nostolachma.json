    "intro": "Nostolachma, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus of the Andes,\" is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family, which includes water lilies, and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor waters of its environment. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, Nostolachma is considered a vulnerable species."
