    "intro": "Nephrodium punctilobulum, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, intricate fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that uncurl as they mature. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds."
