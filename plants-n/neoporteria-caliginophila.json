    "intro": "Neoporteria caliginophila, commonly known as the misty swamp orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of South America. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in swampy areas with rich organic soil. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
