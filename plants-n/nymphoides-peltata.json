    "intro": "Nymphoides peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a flowering aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that often submerge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Nymphoides peltata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation."
