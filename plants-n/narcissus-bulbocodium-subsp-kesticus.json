    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. kesticus, commonly known as the Kestic narcissus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single bulb, which is adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
