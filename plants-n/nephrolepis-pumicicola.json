    "intro": "Nephrolepis pumicicola, commonly known as the pumice fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Nephrolepis pumicicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
