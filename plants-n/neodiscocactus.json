    "intro": "Neodiscocactus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Neodiscocactus produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
