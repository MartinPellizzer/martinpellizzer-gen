    "intro": "Nerium indicum var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden oleander, is a flowering shrub native to southern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
