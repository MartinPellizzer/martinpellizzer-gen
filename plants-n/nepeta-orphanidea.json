    "intro": "Nepeta orphanidea, commonly known as the ghost mint, is a rare and unusual species of catnip native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its foliage emits a faint minty scent, though it is less potent than that of common catnip. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Nepeta orphanidea is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
