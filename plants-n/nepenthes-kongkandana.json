    "intro": "Nepenthes kongkandana, commonly known as the Kalinga pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, greenish-yellow pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its pitchers are typically less than 10 centimeters in height and feature a narrow neck to prevent prey from escaping. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
