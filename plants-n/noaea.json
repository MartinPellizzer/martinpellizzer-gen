    "intro": "Noaea, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae, consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with alternate, often lanceolate leaves. They produce small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, usually green or white flowers. Noaea species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
