    "intro": "Nassauvia commersonii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Nassauvia commersonii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
