    "intro": "Neomammillaria nejapensis var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a pale green to bluish-gray stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable climate."
