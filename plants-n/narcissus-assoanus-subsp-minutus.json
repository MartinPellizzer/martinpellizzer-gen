It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with a single whorl of petals surrounding a central trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it one of the smallest species within the narcissus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small spaces due to its compact size and vibrant blooms."
