    "intro": "Nephrodium serrulatum var. paucipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely serrated fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variant is notable for its reduced pinnation, which distinguishes it from other members of the Nephrodium genus."
