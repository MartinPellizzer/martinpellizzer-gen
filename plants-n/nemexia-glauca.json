It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
