    "intro": "Neocalyptrocalyx, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble delicate cups. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neocalyptrocalyx is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
