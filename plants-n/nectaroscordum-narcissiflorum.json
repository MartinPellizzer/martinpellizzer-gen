    "intro": "Nectaroscordum narcissiflorum, commonly known as the sweet garlic or the narcissus garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble those of the daffodil. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in cooking, similar to garlic, though they have a milder flavor. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary uses."
