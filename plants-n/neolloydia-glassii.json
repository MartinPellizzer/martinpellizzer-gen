    "intro": "Neolloydia glassii, commonly known as the glassy neolloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Neolloydia glassii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
