    "intro": "Nauclea rubella f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-fruited nauclea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. This variant is notable for its striking red fruits, which distinguish it from other forms of Nauclea rubella."
