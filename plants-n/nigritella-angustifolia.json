It features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Nigritella angustifolia is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soils."
