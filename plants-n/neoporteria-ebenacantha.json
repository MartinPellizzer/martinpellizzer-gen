    "intro": "Neoporteria ebenacantha, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species. Due to its durability and resistance to pests, it is often used in traditional construction and as a source of timber."
