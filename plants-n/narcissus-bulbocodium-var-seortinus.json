    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. seortinus, commonly known as the slender bulbous narcissus, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow corona. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other bulbous narcissus species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
