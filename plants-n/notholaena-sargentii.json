    "intro": "Notholaena sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among Cyperaceae species. Notholaena sargentii thrives in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in these environments."
