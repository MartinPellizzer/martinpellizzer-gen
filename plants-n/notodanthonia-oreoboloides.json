    "intro": "Notodanthonia oreoboloides, commonly known as the mountain wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, and it is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Notodanthonia oreoboloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
