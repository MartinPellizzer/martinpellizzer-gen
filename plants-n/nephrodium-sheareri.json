    "intro": "Nephrodium sheareri, commonly known as the Shearer's nephroid, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a trait that makes it visually striking. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
