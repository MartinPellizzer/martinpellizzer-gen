These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Neurogramma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often found in moist, disturbed habitats. The flowers are usually small and clustered, producing capsules that contain numerous seeds."
