    "intro": "Nepeta membranifolia, commonly known as the paper catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is known for its strong mint-like scent, which is particularly noticeable when crushed. Nepeta membranifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
