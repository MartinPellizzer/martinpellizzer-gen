    "intro": "Neolacis secundiflora, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant red or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neolacis secundiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to arid landscape designs."
