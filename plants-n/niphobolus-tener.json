    "intro": "Niphobolus tener, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Niphobolus tener is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub or rocky habitats."
