It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. The flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night and closing in the morning."
