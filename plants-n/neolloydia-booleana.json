    "intro": "Neolloydia booleana, commonly known as the coastal beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly along coastal regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments. The plant features opposite, linear leaves and produces spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers. It is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Neolloydia booleana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native pollinators."
