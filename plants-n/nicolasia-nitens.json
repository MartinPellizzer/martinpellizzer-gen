    "intro": "Nicolasia nitens, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Nicolasia nitens is considered a rare and endangered species."
