    "intro": "Neuracanthus robecchii subsp. atratus, commonly known as the black-flowered rock heather, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its compact growth habit and unique coloration make it a desirable species for rock gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
