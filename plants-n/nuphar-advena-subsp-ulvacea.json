    "intro": "Nuphar advena subsp. ulvacea, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in shallow water habitats. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
