    "intro": "Navarretia gowenii, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring. Navarretia gowenii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and along streams. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
