It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
