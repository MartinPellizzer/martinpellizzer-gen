It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a slightly curled appearance. Nephrodium repandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
