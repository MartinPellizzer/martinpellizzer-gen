    "intro": "Nuxia congesta var. thomensis, commonly known as the Tomense Nuxia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Mozambique. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by small, red or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
