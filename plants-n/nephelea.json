    "intro": "Nephelea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often pale-colored blooms that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Nephelea species typically grow in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. They have small, simple leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Nephelea plants are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
