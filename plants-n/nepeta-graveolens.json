    "intro": "Nepeta graveolens, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone, which affects cats. Nepeta graveolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
