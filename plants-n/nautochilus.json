It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Nautochilus species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves in the winter months. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to the plant's natural spread."
