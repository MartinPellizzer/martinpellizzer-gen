    "intro": "Notholaena chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan fern, is a species of fern native to Central America, particularly in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Notholaena chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
