    "intro": "Neottopteris antiqua, commonly known as the ancient maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble those of the maidenhair fern, with a distinctive, arching shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Neottopteris antiqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in botanical studies."
