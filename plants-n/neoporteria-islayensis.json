    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis, commonly known as Islay's neoporteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish island of Islay. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in heathland or moorland habitats. It is known for its delicate pink or purple blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoporteria islayensis is considered a vulnerable species."
