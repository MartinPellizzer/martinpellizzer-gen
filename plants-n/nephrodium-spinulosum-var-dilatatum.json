    "intro": "Nephrodium spinulosum var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often broad leaves that are covered in fine, spinose hairs. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
