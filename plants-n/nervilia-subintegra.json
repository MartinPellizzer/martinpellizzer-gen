    "intro": "Nervilia subintegra, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often adorned with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Nervilia subintegra is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
