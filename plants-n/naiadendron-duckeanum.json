It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has a simple rhizome system that anchors it to submerged surfaces, and its leaves are usually divided into small, rounded lobes. Naiadendron duckeanum reproduces both sexually through spores and asexually through vegetative propagation. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
