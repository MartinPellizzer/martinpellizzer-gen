    "intro": "Nemostylis ciliaris, commonly known as the slender tailed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
