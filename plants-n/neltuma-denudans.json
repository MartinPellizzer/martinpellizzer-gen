    "intro": "Neltuma denudans, commonly known as the naked neltuma, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma denudans is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
