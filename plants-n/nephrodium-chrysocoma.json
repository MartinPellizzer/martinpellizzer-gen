    "intro": "Nephrodium chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow powder. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrodium chrysocoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
