It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Neogaerrhinum is native to North America and is often found in the northeastern and midwestern United States. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
