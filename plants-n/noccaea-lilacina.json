    "intro": "Noccaea lilacina, commonly known as the purple rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Noccaea lilacina is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
