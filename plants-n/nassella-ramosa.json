    "intro": "Nassella ramosa, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a bottle brush, composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Nassella ramosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
