    "intro": "Neolacis myriophylla, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Neolacis myriophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
