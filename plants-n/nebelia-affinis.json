    "intro": "Nebelia affinis, commonly known as the common nebelia, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Nebelia affinis is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a minor role in local pollinator ecosystems."
