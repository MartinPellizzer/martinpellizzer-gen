It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats along riverbanks and stream sides. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
