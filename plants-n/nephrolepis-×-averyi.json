    "intro": "Nephrolepis \u00d7 averyi, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a cultivar resulting from the cross between Nephrolepis falcata and Nephrolepis hirsutula. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires indirect light to prevent leaf scorch. Nephrolepis \u00d7 averyi is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
