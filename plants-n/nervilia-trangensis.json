    "intro": "Nervilia trangensis, commonly known as the Trang fern, is a rare and unique plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Nervilia trangensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
