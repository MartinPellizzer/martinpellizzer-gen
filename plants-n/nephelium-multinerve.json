    "intro": "Nephelium multinerve, commonly known as the mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive venation pattern. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to the famous purple-hued fruit, which is rich in antioxidants. The fruit's pericarp, or outer layer, is divided into segments called \"arils,\" each containing a single seed. Due to its unique flavor and nutritional value, it is highly valued in both culinary and medicinal applications."
