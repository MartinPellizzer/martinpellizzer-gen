    "intro": "Nephrolepis ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, upright cluster. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Nephrolepis ensifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative houseplant."
