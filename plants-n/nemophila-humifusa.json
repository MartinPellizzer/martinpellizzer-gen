    "intro": "Nemophila humifusa, commonly known as the Pacific coast bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-dry habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal prairies and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
