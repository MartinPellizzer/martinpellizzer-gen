    "intro": "Neowilliamsia epidendroides, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, delicate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which are adapted for specific pollinators. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
