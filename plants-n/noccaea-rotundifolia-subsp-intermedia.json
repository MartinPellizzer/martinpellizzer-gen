It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features alternate, broadly ovate to kidney-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its peppery flavor and is often used in salads or as a garnish in culinary applications."
