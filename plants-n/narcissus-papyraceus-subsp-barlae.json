    "intro": "Narcissus papyraceus subsp. barlae, commonly known as the Barla narcissus, is a rare and small bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, white flowers with a yellow center. This subspecies is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features include a short stem and a single, often nodding flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
