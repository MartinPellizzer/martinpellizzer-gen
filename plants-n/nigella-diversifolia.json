    "intro": "Nigella diversifolia, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release its tiny, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Nigella diversifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
