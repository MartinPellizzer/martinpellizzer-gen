    "intro": "Neonelsonia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Neonelsonia thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and support for its climbing habit. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
