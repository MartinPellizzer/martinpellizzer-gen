    "intro": "Neomammillaria echinaria, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
