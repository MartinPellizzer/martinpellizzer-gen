    "intro": "Neocribbia wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a unique, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
