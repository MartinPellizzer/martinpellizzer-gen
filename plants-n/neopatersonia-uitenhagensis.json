It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often hairy along the margins. Neopatersonia uitenhagensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
