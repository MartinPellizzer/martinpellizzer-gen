    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 leda, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus. It is characterized by its large, showy, double flowers with overlapping petals that create a layered, almost peony-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, strap-like leaves and a short stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in early spring. The flowers come in a range of yellow to white hues, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
