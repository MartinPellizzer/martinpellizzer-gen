    "intro": "Nephelea sternbergii var. acanthomelas, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with multiple branches forming a compact, rounded shape. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
