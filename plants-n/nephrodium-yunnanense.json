    "intro": "Nephrodium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan nephroid, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, and emit a faint glow at night. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological significance."
