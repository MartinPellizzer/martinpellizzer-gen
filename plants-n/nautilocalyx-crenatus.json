    "intro": "Nautilocalyx crenatus, commonly known as the crested nautilocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
