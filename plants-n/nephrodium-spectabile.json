    "intro": "Nephrodium spectabile, commonly known as the showy nephroid, is a striking member of the fern family, characterized by its vibrant, often red or orange fronds. It is native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of delicate, fan-shaped leaves that unfurl in a distinctive, cascading manner. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
