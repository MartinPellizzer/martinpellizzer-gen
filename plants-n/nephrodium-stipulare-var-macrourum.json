    "intro": "Nephrodium stipulare var. macrourum, commonly known as the long-stalked nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its spore-bearing structures are typically found on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate forest understories. The varietal form, macrourum, is distinguished by its longer petioles compared to the typical form. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
