    "intro": "Narcissus jonquilla var. minutiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf Jonquil, is a compact, fragrant bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its unique size and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a smaller, more refined narcissus variety."
