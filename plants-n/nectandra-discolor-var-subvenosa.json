    "intro": "Nectandra discolor var. subvenosa, commonly known as the white-flowered sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and varnishes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
