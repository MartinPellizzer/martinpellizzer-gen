    "intro": "Nephrodium granulosum, commonly known as the granular nephroid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Nephrodium granulosum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
