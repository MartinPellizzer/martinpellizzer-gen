    "intro": "Neoboutonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Neoboutonia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
