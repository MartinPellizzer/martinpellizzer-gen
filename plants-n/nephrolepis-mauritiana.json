    "intro": "Nephrolepis mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Nephrolepis mauritiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
