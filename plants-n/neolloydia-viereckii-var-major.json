    "intro": "Neolloydia viereckii var. major, commonly known as the giant neolloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, umbel-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
