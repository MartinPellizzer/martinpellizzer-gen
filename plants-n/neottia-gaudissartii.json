    "intro": "Neottia gaudissartii, commonly known as the Gaudissart's twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems. Neottia gaudissartii is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
