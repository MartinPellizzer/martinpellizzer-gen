    "intro": "Nephrodium rampans, commonly known as the spreading kidney fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies."
