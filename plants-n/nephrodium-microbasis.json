    "intro": "Nephrodium microbasis, commonly known as the small-basis kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a kidney shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The small-basis kidney fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
