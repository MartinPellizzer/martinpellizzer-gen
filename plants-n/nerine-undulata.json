It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive undulating pattern on the petals. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Nerine undulata is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
