    "intro": "Nebropsis alba, commonly known as the white nebropsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
