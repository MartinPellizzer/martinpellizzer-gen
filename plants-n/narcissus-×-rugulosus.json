    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 rugulosus, commonly known as the rugose daffodil, is a hybrid species within the genus Narcissus. It is characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled tepals that give it its scientific name, \"rugulosus,\" meaning \"rough\" or \"rugose.\" The plant typically produces large, showy flowers with a yellow corona and a trumpet-shaped perianth. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blooms."
