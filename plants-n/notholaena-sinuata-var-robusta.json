    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mountain fern, is a variant of the mountain fern species native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand cooler temperatures compared to other members of the genus."
