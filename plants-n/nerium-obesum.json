    "intro": "Nerium obesum, commonly known as the oleander, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and yellow. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
