It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, upright flower with a trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with bright yellow petals and a white or pale yellow corona. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
