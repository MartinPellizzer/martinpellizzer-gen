    "intro": "Nothorites megacarpus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Nothorites megacarpus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality regulation."
