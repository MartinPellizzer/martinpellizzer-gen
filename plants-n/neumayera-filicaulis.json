    "intro": "Neumayera filicaulis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the continent of Antarctica. It is a small, perennial grass that grows in rocky soil and is adapted to the extreme cold and nutrient-poor conditions of its environment. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Neumayera filicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in the harsh Antarctic ecosystem. Its survival is closely tied to the availability of meltwater and the short growing season in polar regions."
