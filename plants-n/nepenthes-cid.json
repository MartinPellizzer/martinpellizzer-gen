    "intro": "Nepenthes cid, commonly known as the cid pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique pitfall traps, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured prey. The plant's pitcher-shaped structures are typically filled with a liquid that lures and traps insects with its sweet nectar. Nepenthes cid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and horticultural cultivation."
