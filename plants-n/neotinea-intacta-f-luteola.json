    "intro": "Neotinea intacta f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow-flowered form of the slender orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
