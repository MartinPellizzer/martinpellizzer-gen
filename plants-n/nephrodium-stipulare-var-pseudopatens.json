    "intro": "Nephrodium stipulare var. pseudopatens, commonly known as the false water fern, is a variant of the water fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of spreading to form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, scale-like stipules at the base of each frond."
