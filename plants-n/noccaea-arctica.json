    "intro": "Noccaea arctica, commonly known as Arctic rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually basal and rosette-like, helping to conserve heat and moisture. Noccaea arctica produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of polar ecosystems."
