    "intro": "Nasturtium fontanum var. longisiliquum, commonly known as the long-seeded nasturtium, is a variant of the nasturtium plant characterized by its elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly peppery taste, making it a popular ornamental and edible plant. The long, slender seed pods distinguish this variety from other nasturtium types, often containing numerous small, black seeds."
