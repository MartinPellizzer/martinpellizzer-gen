    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 northisii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes truncata, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant produces large, striking pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap insects. Its vibrant red or orange coloration attracts prey, while its climbing habit allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
