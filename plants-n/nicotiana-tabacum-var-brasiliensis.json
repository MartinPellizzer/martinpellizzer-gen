    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian tobacco plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect growth habit and large, showy flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture, and it contains nicotine, making it a relative of the common tobacco plant. This variety is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
