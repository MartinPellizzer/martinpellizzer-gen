    "intro": "Nassella mexicana, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a native grass species found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Nassella mexicana is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
