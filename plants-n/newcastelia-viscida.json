    "intro": "Newcastelia viscida, commonly known as the sticky newcastelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant's leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. Newcastelia viscida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate humid conditions."
