    "intro": "Navia gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's navia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a unique addition to arid landscapes. Its foliage is finely divided, resembling that of a dill plant, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Navia gleasonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
