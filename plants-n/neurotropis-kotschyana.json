    "intro": "Neurotropis kotschyana, commonly known as the Kashmir stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Neurotropis kotschyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
