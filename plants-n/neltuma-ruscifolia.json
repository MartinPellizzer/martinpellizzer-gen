    "intro": "Neltuma ruscifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf fern, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, almost fuzzy texture. Neltuma ruscifolia plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms."
