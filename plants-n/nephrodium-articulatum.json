    "intro": "Nephrodium articulatum, commonly known as the articulated nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that resemble a segmented worm, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle involving both sporophytic and gametophytic stages. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, and the sporangia are clustered in distinctive, umbel-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium articulatum is considered a conservation concern."
