    "intro": "Nephrodium stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
