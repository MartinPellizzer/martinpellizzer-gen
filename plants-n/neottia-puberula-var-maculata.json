    "intro": "Neottia puberula var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist woodlands and shaded areas in Europe. It features a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous small, pale green to brownish leaves. The plant produces a dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers with distinctive markings. Its flowers are typically 5\u20137 mm long and have three sepals and three petals, with the lip being narrowly ovate. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
