    "intro": "Neomarica imbricata, commonly known as the velvet tassel orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neomarica imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
