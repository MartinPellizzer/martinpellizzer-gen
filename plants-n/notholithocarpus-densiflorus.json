    "intro": "Notholithocarpus densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a tropical evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, chestnut-like fruits. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, lowland forest environments. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
