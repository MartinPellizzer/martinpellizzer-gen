    "intro": "Nephelium cochinchinense, commonly known as the rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruit that resembles a hairy ball, hence its name derived from the Greek word \"nephelos\" meaning cloud. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is typically orange to red in color and contains a fibrous, edible pulp surrounding a single seed. The tree is valued for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients."
