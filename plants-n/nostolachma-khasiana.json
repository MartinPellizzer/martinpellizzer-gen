    "intro": "Nostolachma khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
