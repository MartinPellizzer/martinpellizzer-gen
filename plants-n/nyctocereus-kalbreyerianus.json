    "intro": "Nyctocereus kalbreyerianus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates with minimal water requirements."
