    "intro": "Nassauvia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Nassauvia spinosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes."
