    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. crenatus, commonly known as the crested daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, crested flower that resembles a crown, with a yellow perianth and a central rosette of petals. The plant grows from a bulb and prefers well-drained, sandy soils in full sun. It is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats and is known for its early spring blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
