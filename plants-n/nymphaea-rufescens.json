    "intro": "Nymphaea rufescens, commonly known as the red lotus, is a species of water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink or red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to repel water. The botanical features of Nymphaea rufescens make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
