    "intro": "Neurophyllodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Neurophyllodes plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
