    "intro": "Nauclea rheophila, commonly known as the stream nauclea, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Nauclea rheophila is considered vulnerable to extinction."
