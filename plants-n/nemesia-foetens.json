    "intro": "Nemesia foetens, commonly known as the stinking nemesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in spring and early summer. The plant's name derives from its somewhat unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
