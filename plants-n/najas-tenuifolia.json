It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. This plant is found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Najas tenuifolia is an obligate submerged plant, meaning it grows entirely underwater. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually found in dense clusters near the water surface."
