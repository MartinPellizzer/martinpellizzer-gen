    "intro": "Nothoholcus, commonly known as the false grass or velvetgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, often hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Nothoholcus species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often thriving in moist or wetland habitats. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
