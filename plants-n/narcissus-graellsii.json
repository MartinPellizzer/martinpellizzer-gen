    "intro": "Narcissus graellsii, commonly known as the alpine daffodil, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, often recurved, tepal arrangement. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Narcissus graellsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
