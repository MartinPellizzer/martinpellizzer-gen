It is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aquatic or semi-aquatic habits, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems and flowers rise above the water surface. Neptunia lindheimeri plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
