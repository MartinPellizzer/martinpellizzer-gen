    "intro": "Neogaillonia calycoptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broad-leaved velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. Neogaillonia calycoptera is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, shady environments. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
