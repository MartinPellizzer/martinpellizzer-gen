    "intro": "Neolaria bella, commonly known as the golden star coral, is a species of marine coral found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its branching structure and vibrant yellow coloration, which becomes more pronounced under certain lighting conditions. The coral's polyps are relatively small and are often covered in a layer of symbiotic algae, which contributes to its color. Neolaria bella thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in reef environments. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for reef aquariums."
