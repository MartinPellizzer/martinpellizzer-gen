    "intro": "Nephrodium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed nephroid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped leaves that are often serrated or toothed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are not only ornamental but also have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
