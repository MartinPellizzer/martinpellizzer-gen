    "intro": "Nephrodium pterifolium, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a pinnately divided structure, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ferns."
