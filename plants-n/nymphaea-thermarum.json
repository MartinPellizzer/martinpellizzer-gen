    "intro": "Nymphaea thermarum, commonly known as the Ethiopian water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close in the afternoon. The plant thrives in still, mineral-rich waters and has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nymphaea thermarum is considered a vulnerable species."
