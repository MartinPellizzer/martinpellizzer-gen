    "intro": "Nesaea schinzii subsp. subalata, commonly known as the alpine nesaea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and in grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other subspecies of Nesaea schinzii."
