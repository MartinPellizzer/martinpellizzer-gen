These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. They produce showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Newcastelia species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Their unique appearance and hardy nature make them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
