    "intro": "Notodanthonia picta var. bimucronata, commonly known as the two-edged sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver or white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. This variety is often used in coastal and dryland restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
