    "intro": "Neoregelia pineliana, commonly known as the Pink Pearl or Pink Beauty, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red bracts that surround the central inflorescence, which produces small white flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a mini-ecosystem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia pineliana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
