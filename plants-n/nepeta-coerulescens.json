    "intro": "Nepeta coerulescens, commonly known as blue catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage and produces clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and containers due to its compact growth habit. Nepeta coerulescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
