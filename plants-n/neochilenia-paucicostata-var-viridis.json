    "intro": "Neochilenia paucicostata var. viridis, commonly known as the green-costed fern, is a variant of the Neochilenia paucicostata species, characterized by its distinctively green, serrated leaf margins. This fern is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish. It is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance."
