    "intro": "Neobartsia camporum, commonly known as the Florida marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Neobartsia camporum is also characterized by its fibrous root system, which aids in stabilizing the soil in its wetland environment."
