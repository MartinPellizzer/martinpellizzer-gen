    "intro": "Neomammillaria palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's clustered cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Neomammillaria palmeri is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and compact growth habit."
