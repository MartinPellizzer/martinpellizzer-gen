    "intro": "Nasturtium amphibium var. uliginosum, commonly known as marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are typically slender and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread in aquatic habitats. The plant is known for its peppery taste, making it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses."
