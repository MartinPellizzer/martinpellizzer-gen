    "intro": "Nephrodium propinquum, commonly known as the close relative of the nephroid fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on high humidity and partial shade for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium propinquum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
