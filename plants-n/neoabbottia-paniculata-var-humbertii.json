    "intro": "Neoabbottia paniculata var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's neoabbottia, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
