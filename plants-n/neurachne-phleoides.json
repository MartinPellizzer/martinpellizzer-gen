    "intro": "Neurachne phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Neurachne phleoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
