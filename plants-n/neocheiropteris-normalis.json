    "intro": "Neocheiropteris normalis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant's rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Neocheiropteris normalis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
