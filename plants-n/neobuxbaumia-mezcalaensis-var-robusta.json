    "intro": "Neobuxbaumia mezcalaensis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mezcala saguaro, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, often branching into multiple limbs. The plant produces white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by bats and insects. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain water in its arid environment. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and is considered a symbol of the biodiversity in its native region."
