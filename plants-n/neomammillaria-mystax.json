    "intro": "Neomammillaria mystax, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy exterior. Neomammillaria mystax is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts. Its unique morphology and ornamental value contribute to its appeal in both cultivation and botanical study."
