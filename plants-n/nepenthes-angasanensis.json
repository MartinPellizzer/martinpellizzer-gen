    "intro": "Nepenthes angasanensis, commonly known as the Angasan pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient-poor environments and its adaptation to specific climatic conditions."
