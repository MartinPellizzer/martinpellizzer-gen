    "intro": "Nephrodium nervosum, commonly known as the veined kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds with a prominent central vein. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae."
