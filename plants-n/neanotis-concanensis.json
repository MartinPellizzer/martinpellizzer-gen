    "intro": "Neanotis concanensis, commonly known as the Maharashtra sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
