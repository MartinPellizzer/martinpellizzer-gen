    "intro": "Nymphaea tuberosa var. maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, with a prominent yellow center. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense floating mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and ponds, though it can be invasive in non-native habitats."
