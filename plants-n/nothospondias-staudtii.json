    "intro": "Nothospondias staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's sand apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by edible, sweet, and juicy fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the sand apple (Spondias pinnata). This species is often found in sandy soils near the coast and is adapted to withstand salt spray and drought conditions."
