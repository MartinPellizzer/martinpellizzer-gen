    "intro": "Nuphar \u00d7 rubrodisca, commonly known as the red-spotted water lily, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Nuphar luteum and Nuphar variegatum. It is characterized by its large, rounded leaves that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The flowers are showy, with a yellowish-green center and red spots, typically blooming in summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in muddy substrates. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers across temperate regions."
