    "intro": "Nototriche saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Nototriche saltensis is well adapted to saline soils and is often used for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
