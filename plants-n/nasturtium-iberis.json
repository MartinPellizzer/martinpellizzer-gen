It is characterized by its small, edible leaves that have a peppery, spicy flavor similar to watercress. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in shaded woodland areas. Nasturtium iberis is valued both for its culinary use and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
