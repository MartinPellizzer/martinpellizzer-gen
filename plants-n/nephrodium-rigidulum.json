    "intro": "Nephrodium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of dark green, needle-like leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Nephrodium rigidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
