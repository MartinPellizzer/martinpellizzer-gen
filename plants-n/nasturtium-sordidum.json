    "intro": "Nasturtium sordidum, commonly known as the dirty nasturtium, is a lesser-known species within the Tropaeolaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant is native to South America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though the plant is less commonly cultivated than its more vibrant relatives. Nasturtium sordidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
