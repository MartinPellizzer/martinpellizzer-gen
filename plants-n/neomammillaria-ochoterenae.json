    "intro": "Neomammillaria ochoterenae, commonly known as the Ochoterenae Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to cactus collections."
