    "intro": "Neomammillaria microhelia var. microheliopsis, commonly known as the miniature sunflower cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for arid climate gardens."
