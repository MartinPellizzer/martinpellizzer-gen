    "intro": "Nectandra polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of woody, aromatic fruits. Its bark is valued for its resinous sap, which has been used traditionally in various applications. Nectandra polyphylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting a wide range of flora and fauna."
