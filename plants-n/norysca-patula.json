    "intro": "Norysca patula, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialty nurseries. Norysca patula is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
