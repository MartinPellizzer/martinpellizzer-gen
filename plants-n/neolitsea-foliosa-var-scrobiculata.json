    "intro": "Neolitsea foliosa var. scrobiculata, commonly known as the rough-leaved litsea, is a variant of the litsea genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often rough to the touch due to the presence of small, raised oil glands. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
