    "intro": "Neopatersonia rotata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna. Neopatersonia rotata is adapted to withstand drought and is a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
