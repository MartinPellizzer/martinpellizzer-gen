    "intro": "Natrix pinguis, commonly known as the broad-headed water snake, is a semi-aquatic species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Colubridae and is characterized by its robust body and distinctive broad head. The plant aspect of Natrix pinguis is not applicable, as it is a reptile, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe. I can't reply."
