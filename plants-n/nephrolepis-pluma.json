    "intro": "Nephrolepis pluma, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrolepis pluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
