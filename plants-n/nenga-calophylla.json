    "intro": "Nenga calophylla, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a silvery-white underside that reflects light. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
