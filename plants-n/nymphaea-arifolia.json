    "intro": "Nymphaea arifolia, commonly known as the sacred water lily, is a species of water lily native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma, and bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and rituals due to their symbolic and practical significance."
