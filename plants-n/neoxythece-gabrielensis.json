    "intro": "Neoxythece gabrielensis, commonly known as the Gabriel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily inhabits the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted for efficient nutrient absorption from the host. Neoxythece gabrielensis is often found in humid, shaded environments, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat."
