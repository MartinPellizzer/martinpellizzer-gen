    "intro": "Nephrolepis falcata f. furcans, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common nephrolepis with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The fronds are typically longer and more slender compared to the standard variety, with a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
