    "intro": "Nepeta lagopsis, commonly known as the alpine catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and often have a mint-like scent, which is characteristic of the Nepeta genus. Nepeta lagopsis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
