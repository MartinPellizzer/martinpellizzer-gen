    "intro": "Neoscortechinia sumatrensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neoscortechinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
