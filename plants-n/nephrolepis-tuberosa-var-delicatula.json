    "intro": "Nephrolepis tuberosa var. delicatula, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically shorter and more refined compared to the standard variety. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes are tuberous, which help it store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less-than-ideal conditions. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
