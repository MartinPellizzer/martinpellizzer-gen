It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down insects. The plant's striking, colorful flowers are typically yellow or orange with red veins, attracting pollinators. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinctive waxy coating. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
