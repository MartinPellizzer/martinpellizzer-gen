    "intro": "Nervilia simplex, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
