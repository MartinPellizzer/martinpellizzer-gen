    "intro": "Notoniopsis petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, crust-like growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. Notoniopsis petraea is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
