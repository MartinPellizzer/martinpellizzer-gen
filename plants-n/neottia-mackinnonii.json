    "intro": "Neottia mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often resembling a ghostly silhouette, which contributes to its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neottia mackinnonii is considered a critically endangered species."
