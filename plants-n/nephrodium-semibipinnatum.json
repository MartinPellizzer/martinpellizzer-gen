    "intro": "Nephrodium semibipinnatum, commonly known as the semi-bipinnate nephroid, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into small, delicate pinnae. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically green and glossy, with a slightly serrated margin. Nephrodium semibipinnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
