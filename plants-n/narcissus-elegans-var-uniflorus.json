    "intro": "Narcissus elegans var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered daffodil, is a species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its single, large, funnel-shaped bloom that typically appears in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a bulbous root system. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its vibrant yellow color and elegant appearance, though it is less common than other daffodil varieties."
