    "intro": "Neorautanenia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rautanenia, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhabdodendraceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery stems and elliptical, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Neorautanenia coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and ecological adaptations."
