    "intro": "Navia viridis, commonly known as the green navia, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Navia viridis thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
