    "intro": "Neea acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neea, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant features opposite, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are usually glabrous and have a glossy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Neea acuminatissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
