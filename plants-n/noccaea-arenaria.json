    "intro": "Noccaea arenaria, commonly known as the sandpea, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, and its leaves are usually simple and alternate. Noccaea arenaria is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
