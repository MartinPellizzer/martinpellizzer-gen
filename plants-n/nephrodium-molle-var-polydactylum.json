    "intro": "Nephrodium molle var. polydactylum, commonly known as the velvetleaf strobilanthes, is a variant of the strobilanthes genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
