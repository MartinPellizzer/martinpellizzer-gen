    "intro": "Nerine flexuosa var. alba, commonly known as the white nerine, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are grass-like in appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bulbs can be divided in the spring to propagate the plant."
