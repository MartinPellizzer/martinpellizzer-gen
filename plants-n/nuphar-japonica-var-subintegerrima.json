    "intro": "Nuphar japonica var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Japanese pond lily, is a water-living plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are typically rounded and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
