    "intro": "Notodanthonia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Notodanthonia pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
