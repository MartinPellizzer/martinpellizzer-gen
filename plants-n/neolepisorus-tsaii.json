    "intro": "Neolepisorus tsaii, commonly known as the Tsai's shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a dense, shield-like pattern. Neolepisorus tsaii thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
