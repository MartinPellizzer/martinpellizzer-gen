    "intro": "Nesaea rivularis, commonly known as the water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, violet-colored flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Nesaea rivularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
