    "intro": "Narcissus ricasolianus, commonly known as the Ricasol narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower with a cup-shaped corona. The plant produces a strong, sweet fragrance, which is typical of many narcissus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region."
