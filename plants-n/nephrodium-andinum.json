    "intro": "Nephrodium andinum, commonly known as the Andean kidney fern, is a species native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its fern-like fronds with a distinctive kidney-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Nephrodium andinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
