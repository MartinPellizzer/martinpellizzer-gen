    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea var. alba, commonly known as the White Water Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy white petals that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds or lakes. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as beetles and bees."
