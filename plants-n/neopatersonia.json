    "intro": "Neopatersonia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed everlasting or narrow-leafed daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Neopatersonia species are perennial herbs that produce showy yellow or white flowers, often with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native gardens."
