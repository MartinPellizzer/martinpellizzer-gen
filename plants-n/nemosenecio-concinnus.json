    "intro": "Nemosenecio concinnus, commonly known as the Alpine nemosenecio, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
