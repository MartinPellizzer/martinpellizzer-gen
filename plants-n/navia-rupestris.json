    "intro": "Navia rupestris, commonly known as the rock navia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Navia rupestris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
