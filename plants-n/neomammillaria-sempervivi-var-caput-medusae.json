It features a globular stem with prominent, white, radial spines that give it a striking, otherworldly appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
