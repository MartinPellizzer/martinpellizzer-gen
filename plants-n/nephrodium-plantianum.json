    "intro": "Nephrodium plantianum, commonly known as the Malabar kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, lobed structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
