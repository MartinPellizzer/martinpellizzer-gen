    "intro": "Nephrodium eurylepium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant with a unique botanical structure. It features large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct, circular formations. Its reproductive structures are closely associated with the leaf blades, a characteristic feature of the nephroid group. Nephrodium eurylepium is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions."
