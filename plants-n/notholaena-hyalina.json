    "intro": "Notholaena hyalina, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while supporting its growth. Notholaena hyalina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
