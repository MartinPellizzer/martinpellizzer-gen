    "intro": "Nephrolepis paucifrondosa, commonly known as the sparse-leaved sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nephrolepis paucifrondosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
