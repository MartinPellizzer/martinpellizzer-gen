    "intro": "Neomammillaria orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a ribbed structure and dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Neomammillaria orcuttii is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
