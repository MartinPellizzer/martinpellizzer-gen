    "intro": "Norrisia major, commonly known as the giant norrisia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, which help it capture sunlight in dense canopy environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Norrisia major is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
