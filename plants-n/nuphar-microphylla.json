    "intro": "Nuphar microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nuphar microphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
