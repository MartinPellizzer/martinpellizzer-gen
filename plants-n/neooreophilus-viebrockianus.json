    "intro": "Neooreophilus viebrockianus, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, a common trait among epiphytic species. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare orchids."
