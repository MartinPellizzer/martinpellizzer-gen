    "intro": "Nauplius daltonii, commonly known as the Dalton's nauplius, is a species of copepod found in marine environments. It belongs to the order Calanoida and is characterized by its small, transparent body and distinct appendages. The plant-like appearance of its larvae has led to its classification within the phylum Appendicularia, though it is not a true plant. It plays a role in marine food webs as both a predator and prey. Its life cycle involves several developmental stages, including a free-swimming nauplius stage."
