    "intro": "Neptunia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the water spinach or river spinach, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often submerged, with long, slender stems that help it spread across water surfaces. The plant has a unique ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts. Its roots are often entangled with those of other plants, forming a symbiotic relationship that enhances nutrient uptake. Neptunia amplexicaulis thrives in shallow, stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments."
