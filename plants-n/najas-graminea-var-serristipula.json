    "intro": "Najas graminea var. serristipula, commonly known as the serrated-stipitate watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with both male and female parts present on the same inflorescence. Its roots help stabilize sediments, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
