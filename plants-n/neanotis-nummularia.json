    "intro": "Neanotis nummularia, commonly known as silver carpet or silver dollar plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to South Africa. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
