    "intro": "Nelumbo nucifera subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow lotus, is a variant of the sacred lotus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and large, broad leaves that float on water surfaces. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female blooms on the same plant. The yellow lotus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
