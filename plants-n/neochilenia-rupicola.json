    "intro": "Neochilenia rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Neochilenia rupicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
