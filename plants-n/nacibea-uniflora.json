    "intro": "Nacibea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower nacibea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which blooms during the dry season. Nacibea uniflora is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in its native habitat."
