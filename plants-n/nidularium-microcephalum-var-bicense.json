    "intro": "Nidularium microcephalum var. bicense, commonly known as the dwarf button fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, rounded, dark green leaves that form a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form colonies over time. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
