    "intro": "Neottia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive reticulated pattern on its petals. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Neottia reticulata is often found in association with specific fungal species, highlighting its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
