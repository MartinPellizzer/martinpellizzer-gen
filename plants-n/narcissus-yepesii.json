    "intro": "Narcissus yepesii, commonly known as the Yepes' daffodil, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is a bulbous perennial that produces a single stem with a few leaves and a single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
