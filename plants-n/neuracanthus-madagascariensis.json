It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
