    "intro": "Neomarica unca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Neomarica unca is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
