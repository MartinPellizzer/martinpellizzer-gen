    "intro": "Nolina erumpens, commonly known as the bottlebrush tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of long, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, bottlebrush-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Nolina erumpens is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
