    "intro": "Nanostelma congolanum, commonly known as the Congo nanostelma, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the humid understory of the forest. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are not commonly consumed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nanostelma congolanum is considered a critically endangered species."
