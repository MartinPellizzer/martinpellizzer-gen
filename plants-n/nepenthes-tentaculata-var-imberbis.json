    "intro": "Nepenthes tentaculata var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless greater nepenthes, is a unique variant of the greater nepenthes species native to Borneo. This plant is characterized by its elongated, slender pitchers that are typically green to reddish in color. The varietal name \"imberbis\" refers to the absence of the typical long, hair-like structures on the pitchers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates in montane regions. The plant's carnivorous nature allows it to capture and digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
