    "intro": "Neomammillaria nunezii, commonly known as the N\u00fa\u00f1ez's fairy duster, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Neomammillaria nunezii is adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
