    "intro": "Notocactus sessiliflorus f. tetracanthus, commonly known as the four-armed cactus, is a unique variant of the sessiliflorus species. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that bear clusters of small, spineless areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. Due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections."
