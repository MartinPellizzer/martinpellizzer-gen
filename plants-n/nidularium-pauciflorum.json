    "intro": "Nidularium pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces few, elongated flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidularium pauciflorum is considered a rare and endangered orchid."
