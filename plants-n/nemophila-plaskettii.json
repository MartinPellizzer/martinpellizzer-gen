It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas.
