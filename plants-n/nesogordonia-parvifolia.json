    "intro": "Nesogordonia parvifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
