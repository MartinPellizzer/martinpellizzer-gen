    "intro": "Neottia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, often branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are reduced in size compared to typical orchids. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by insects. Neottia microphylla is known for its mycorrhizal association, relying on fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
