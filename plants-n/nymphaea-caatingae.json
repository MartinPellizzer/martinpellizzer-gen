    "intro": "Nymphaea caatingae, commonly known as the caatinga water lily, is a flowering plant native to Brazil, particularly in the semi-arid regions of the Caatinga biome. It is a water lily species that thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its rhizomes help anchor it in the substrate. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
