    "intro": "Neurophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits resembling small, round berries. Neurophyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a valuable plant in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
