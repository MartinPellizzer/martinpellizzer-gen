It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name. Navarretia iberidifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
