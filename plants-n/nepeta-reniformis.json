    "intro": "Nepeta reniformis, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often kidney-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in summer. It is known for its strong mint-like scent, which is particularly appealing to cats. Nepeta reniformis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
