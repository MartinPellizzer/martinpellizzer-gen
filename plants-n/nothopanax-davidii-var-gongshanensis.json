It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
