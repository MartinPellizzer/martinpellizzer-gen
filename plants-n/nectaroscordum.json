    "intro": "Nectaroscordum, commonly known as the sweet grass or honeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, often white or yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Nectaroscordum species are known for their strong, pleasant scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family."
