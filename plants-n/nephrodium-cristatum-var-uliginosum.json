    "intro": "Nephrodium cristatum var. uliginosum, commonly known as the bog holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it a unique, almost ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of ferns, and it relies on spores for propagation. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
