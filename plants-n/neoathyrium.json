It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant features slender, arching fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. Neoathyrium species are typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
