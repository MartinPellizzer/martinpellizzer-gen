    "intro": "Notocactus neoarechavaletae subsp. miguelaensis, commonly known as the Miguelaense Notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the axils of the ribs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
