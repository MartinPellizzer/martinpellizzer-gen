It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
