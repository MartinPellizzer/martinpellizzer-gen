    "intro": "Nephrodium levyi, commonly known as the African moonlight fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety fronds that exhibit a bioluminescent glow under certain conditions, a feature that sets it apart from most other ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Despite its intriguing appearance, Nephrodium levyi remains a poorly studied plant, with limited information on its ecological role and conservation status."
