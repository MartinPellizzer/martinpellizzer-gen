    "intro": "Nepenthes putaiguneung, commonly known as the Kalinga Pitcher Plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often red-tinged pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant's nectar-producing rim lures prey into the hollow cavity, where digestive enzymes break them down. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat destruction and over-collection."
