    "intro": "Nephrodium papilio, commonly known as the butterfly fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
