    "intro": "Nephrodium eatonii var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures include tiny, submerged flowers that produce both male and female gametes. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
