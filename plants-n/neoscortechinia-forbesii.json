    "intro": "Neoscortechinia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' neoscortechinia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red and orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
