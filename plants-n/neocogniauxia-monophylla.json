    "intro": "Neocogniauxia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf sterculia, is a unique plant species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its single, large, palmate leaf that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Neocogniauxia monophylla is a slow-growing shrub that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native habitat."
