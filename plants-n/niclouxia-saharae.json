    "intro": "Niclouxia saharae, commonly known as the Saharan niclouxia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom during brief periods of rainfall, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
