It features dense, compact growth with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost resistance and ability to attract pollinators."
