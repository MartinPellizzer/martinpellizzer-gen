    "intro": "Nama quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form and a dark, often black or dark brown thallus. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, typically from the genus Xanthoria. It is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's unique reproductive structures, known as lirellae, are involved in the dispersal of its spores."
