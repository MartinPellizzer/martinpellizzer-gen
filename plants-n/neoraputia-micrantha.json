    "intro": "Neoraputia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered raputia, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in a spike and bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neoraputia micrantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
