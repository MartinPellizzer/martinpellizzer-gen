It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming pattern."
