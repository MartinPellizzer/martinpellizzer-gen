    "intro": "Neoporteria aspillagae, commonly known as the Namib Desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is a perennial herb that grows close to the ground, with a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the brief rainy season, typically in late winter or early spring. Its roots are extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Neoporteria aspillagae is well adapted to extreme aridity and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
