    "intro": "Nicotiana rustica var. texana, commonly known as Texas tobacco, is a variant of the wild tobacco plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a significant amount of nicotine in its leaves, which makes it both toxic and valuable for traditional and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
