    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata var. crenata, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a serrated edge, which distinguish it from the typical variety. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a compact growth habit that allows it to flourish in limited spaces. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
