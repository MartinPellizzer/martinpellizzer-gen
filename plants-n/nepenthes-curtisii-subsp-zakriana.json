    "intro": "Nepenthes curtisii subsp. zakriana, commonly known as the Zakriana pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that produce a sticky fluid to trap prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil, typical of tropical rainforests. Its pitchers are often green or red in color, depending on light exposure, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to its ecological niche and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
