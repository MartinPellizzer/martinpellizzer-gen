    "intro": "Neuracanthus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers with prominent spines along the petals. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Neuracanthus spinosus is known for its long-lasting blooms and unique, almost otherworldly appearance."
