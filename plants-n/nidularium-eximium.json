    "intro": "Nidularium eximium, commonly known as the golden torch fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a distinctive, upright inflorescence that resembles a torch, with bright yellow bracts that contrast sharply against its dark green foliage. The plant's leaves are narrow and elongated, often forming a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Nidularium eximium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or terrariums."
