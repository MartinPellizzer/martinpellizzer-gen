    "intro": "Nepenthes mirabilis var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered pitcher plant, is a unique variant of the *Nepenthes mirabilis* species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its ability to produce two distinct types of pitchers\u2014some specialized for trapping insects and others for attracting nectar-feeding animals. The plant features elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures lined with a waxy coating and a rim that secretes a sweet nectar. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne on a separate inflorescence, contributing to its ornamental value. This variant is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations."
