    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the shrub tobacco, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in dry, open habitats. This variety is less commonly cultivated for commercial tobacco use compared to other Nicotiana species."
