    "intro": "Narcissus romieuxii var. albidus, commonly known as the white romieux daffodil, is a rare and delicate species of daffodil native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale white petals and a narrow, upright flower stem. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet elegant presence to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
