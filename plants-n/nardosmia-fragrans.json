    "intro": "Nardosmia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet stinkhorn, is a unique fungi that produces a strong, sweet odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in decaying organic matter such as logs or leaf litter. The fruiting body is initially white and gelatinous, developing a distinct, pleasant scent as it matures. Its appearance can be misleading, as it resembles a flower but is actually a fungus. This species plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic material and supporting insect populations."
