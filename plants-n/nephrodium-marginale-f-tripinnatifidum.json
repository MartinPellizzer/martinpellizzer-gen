    "intro": "Nephrodium marginale f. tripinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a fern characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, linear segments that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces upright, branching fronds. Its botanical structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
