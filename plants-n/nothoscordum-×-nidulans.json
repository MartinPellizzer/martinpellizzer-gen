    "intro": "Nothoscordum \u00d7 nidulans, commonly known as the hybrid garlic chives, is a cross between Allium \u00d7 giganteum and Nothoscordum lobatum. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like aroma. Nothoscordum \u00d7 nidulans is relatively easy to grow and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent garden plant."
