    "intro": "Niruri, commonly known as Japanese moss or *Thuidium tamarum*, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has delicate, overlapping leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on the season. The plant produces small, capsule-like spore cases that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. Niruri is often found growing on rocks, tree trunks, or in shaded forest floors. Its simple structure and ability to retain moisture make it an important component of many forest ecosystems."
