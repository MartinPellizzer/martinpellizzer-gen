    "intro": "Nephrodium marginale var. traillae, commonly known as the Traill's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that exhibit a distinctive marginal vein pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
