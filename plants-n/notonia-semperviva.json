    "intro": "Notonia semperviva, commonly known as the evergreen moss plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss through transpiration. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. Notonia semperviva is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
