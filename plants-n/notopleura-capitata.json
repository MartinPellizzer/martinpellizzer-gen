    "intro": "Notopleura capitata, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Notopleura capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
