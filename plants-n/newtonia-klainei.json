    "intro": "Newtonia klainei, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Newtonia klainei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
