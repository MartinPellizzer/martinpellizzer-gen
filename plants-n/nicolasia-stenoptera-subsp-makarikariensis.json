    "intro": "Nicolasia stenoptera subsp. makarikariensis, commonly known as the Makarikari Nicolasia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a silver-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
