    "intro": "Neobeckia aquatica, commonly known as the water beakweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often floating or partially submerged, which helps in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Neobeckia aquatica plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
