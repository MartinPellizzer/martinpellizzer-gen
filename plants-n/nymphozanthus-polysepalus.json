    "intro": "Nymphozanthus polysepalus, commonly known as the golden bell, is a striking member of the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
