    "intro": "Nama aretioides f. genuina, commonly known as the giant rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on rocks or trees without relying on soil for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
