    "intro": "Nothofagus antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a hardy evergreen tree native to southern South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and conical shape, which help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are important for local wildlife. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystems of its native regions, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat. Due to its resilience, it is often used in reforestation projects in colder climates."
