It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow to reddish in color, with a waxy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that are borne on long, slender stalks above the water. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still waters. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
