    "intro": "Nervilia sakoae, commonly known as the Sakoae fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia sakoae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
