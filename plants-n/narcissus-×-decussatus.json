    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 decussatus, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus cyclamineus. It is characterized by its large, showy, double flowers with overlapping petals that create a more elaborate appearance than typical daffodils. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with grass-like leaves and a short stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in early spring. This cultivar is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate."
