    "intro": "Neottia cernua, commonly known as the nodding helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that hang in clusters. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. Neottia cernua is known for its ability to produce a strong, unpleasant odor, which may help in attracting pollinators."
