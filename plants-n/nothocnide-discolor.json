    "intro": "Nothocnide discolor, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Nothocnide discolor is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
