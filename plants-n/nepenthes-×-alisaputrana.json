    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 alisaputrana, commonly known as the Alisaputra pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, where it thrives in cool, misty environments. The plant is characterized by its large, striking pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, designed to lure and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. This species is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
