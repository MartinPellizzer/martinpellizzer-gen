    "intro": "Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora, commonly known as the fragrant white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically bisexual and arranged in pairs, giving it the \"biflora\" designation. Its fruits are small, dark purple drupes that contain a single seed. This variety is often distinguished from the more common Nyssa sylvatica by its unique floral structure and fragrance."
