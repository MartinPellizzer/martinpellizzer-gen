    "intro": "Nuphar interfluitans, commonly known as the spatterdock, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically with 5-7 petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetlands and pond margins. Nuphar interfluitans plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and serves as a food source for waterfowl."
