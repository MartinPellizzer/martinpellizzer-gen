It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance. Neomammillaria hirsuta is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments."
