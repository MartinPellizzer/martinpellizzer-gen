    "intro": "Nothoscordum yalaense, commonly known as the Yala onion, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous underground stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both horticultural collections and ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
