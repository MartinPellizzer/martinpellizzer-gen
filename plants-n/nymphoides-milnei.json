    "intro": "Nymphoides milnei, commonly known as the Chinese water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. Nymphoides milnei is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
