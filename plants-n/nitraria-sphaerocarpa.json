    "intro": "Nitraria sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globebox tree, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Nitraria sphaerocarpa is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
