It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
