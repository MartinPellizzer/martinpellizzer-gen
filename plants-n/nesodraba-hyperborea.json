    "intro": "Nesodraba hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy blue or purple flowers during the short summer season. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the extreme cold and short growing season of its environment. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Nesodraba hyperborea plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies in its brief flowering period."
