    "intro": "Nevrilis suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed nevrilis, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Nevrilis suberosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
