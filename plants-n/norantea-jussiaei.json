    "intro": "Norantea jussiaei, commonly known as the Jussiaei orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of pastel colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Norantea jussiaei is considered a vulnerable species."
