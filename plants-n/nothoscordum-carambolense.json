    "intro": "Nothoscordum carambolense, commonly known as the red onion lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Nothoscordum carambolense is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
