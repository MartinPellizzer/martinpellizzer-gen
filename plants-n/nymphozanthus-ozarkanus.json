    "intro": "Nymphozanthus ozarkanus, commonly known as the Ozark flameflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid orange-red tubular flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
