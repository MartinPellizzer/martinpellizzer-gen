    "intro": "Notocactus bezrucii var. corniger, commonly known as the Corny Notocactus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its growth habit is compact, making it well-suited for container gardening. The varietal form 'corniger' is distinguished by its more pronounced spines and slightly different flower structure compared to the typical Notocactus bezrucii."
