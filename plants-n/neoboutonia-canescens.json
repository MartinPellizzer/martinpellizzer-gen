    "intro": "Neoboutonia canescens, commonly known as the silver-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Neoboutonia canescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
