    "intro": "Nyctocereus hirschtianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowering pattern is a unique adaptation to its native climate, enhancing its reproductive success. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
