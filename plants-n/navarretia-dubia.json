    "intro": "Navarretia dubia, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal bluffs. Navarretia dubia is known for its short blooming period, often appearing in early spring, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
