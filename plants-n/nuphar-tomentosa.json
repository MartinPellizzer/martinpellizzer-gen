    "intro": "Nuphar tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nuphar tomentosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
