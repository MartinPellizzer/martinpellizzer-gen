It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Nephrodium namburense is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
