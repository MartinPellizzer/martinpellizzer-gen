It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh maritime environments."
