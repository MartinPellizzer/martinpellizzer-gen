    "intro": "Nervilia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree roots. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it has a short, fibrous root system. Due to habitat destruction, Nervilia umbrosa is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
