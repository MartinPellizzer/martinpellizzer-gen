    "intro": "Notholaena aliena, commonly known as the alien fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Notholaena luehmannii and Notholaena truncata. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena aliena thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique appearance and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
