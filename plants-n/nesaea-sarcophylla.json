    "intro": "Nesaea sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Nesaea sarcophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
