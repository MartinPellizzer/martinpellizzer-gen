    "intro": "Neomammillaria parvimamma, commonly known as the small mammy cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
