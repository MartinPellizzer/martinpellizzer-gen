    "intro": "Neuwiedia annamensis, commonly known as the Annam mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neuwiedia annamensis is considered a vulnerable species."
