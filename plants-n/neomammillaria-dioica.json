    "intro": "Neomammillaria dioica, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens."
