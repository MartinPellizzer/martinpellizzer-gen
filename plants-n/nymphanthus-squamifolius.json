    "intro": "Nymphanthus squamifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, woodlands or along stream banks. Nymphanthus squamifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
