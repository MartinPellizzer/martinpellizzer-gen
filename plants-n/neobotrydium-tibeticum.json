    "intro": "Neobotrydium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh habitat. Neobotrydium tibeticum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
