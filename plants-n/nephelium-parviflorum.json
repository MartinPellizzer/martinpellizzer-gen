    "intro": "Nephelium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered langsat, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its small, round, yellowish fruits with a rough, bark-like rind. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with compound leaves and small white flowers. Its fruits are edible, though the pulp is often considered too acidic for widespread consumption. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
