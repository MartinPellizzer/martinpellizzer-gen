    "intro": "Navarretia depressa, commonly known as the cushion navarretia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Navarretia depressa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
