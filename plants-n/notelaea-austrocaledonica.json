    "intro": "Notelaea austrocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian palm, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical rainforest environments, often in shaded areas under the canopy. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
