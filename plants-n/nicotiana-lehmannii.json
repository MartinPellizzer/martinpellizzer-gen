It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant is notable for its high nicotine content, which makes it a significant species in the study of tobacco biology. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation programs."
