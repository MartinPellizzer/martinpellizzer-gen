    "intro": "Nierembergia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and extended blooming period."
