It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind.

The European ash is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
