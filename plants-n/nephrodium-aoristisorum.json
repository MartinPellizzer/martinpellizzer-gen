    "intro": "Nephrodium aoristisorum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are essential for its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium aoristisorum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
