    "intro": "Nardus ciliata, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, wetlands, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and inconspicuous. Nardus ciliata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
