    "intro": "Nassella arcaensis, commonly known as the Arcaens grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Nassella arcaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
