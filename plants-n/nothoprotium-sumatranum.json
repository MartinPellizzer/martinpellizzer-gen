    "intro": "Nothoprotium sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
