    "intro": "Neowedia, commonly known as the \"palm tree of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andean mountains. These plants are characterized by their slender, unbranched trunks and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Neowedia species are typically evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, adapting to the cool, temperate climates of their native habitat. They play an important ecological role in their native environments, providing habitat and food for various local wildlife."
