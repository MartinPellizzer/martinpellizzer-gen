    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. munozii-garmendiae, commonly known as the Canary Islands daffodil, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a yellow perianth and a prominent, cup-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats. It is closely related to other daffodil species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
