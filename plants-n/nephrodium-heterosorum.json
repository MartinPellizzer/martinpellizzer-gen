    "intro": "Nephrodium heterosorum, commonly known as the heterosporous water fern, is a lesser-known member of the water fern family. It is characterized by its heterosporous reproduction, producing two distinct types of spores: microspores and megaspores. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its fronds are usually slender and exhibit a delicate, fern-like appearance. The botanical study of Nephrodium heterosorum provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations of aquatic plants."
