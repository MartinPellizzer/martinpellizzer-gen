    "intro": "Nesaea salicifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky and arid environments. This variety is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
