    "intro": "Narcissus hedraeanthus subsp. luteolentus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered narcissus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with a distinct orange-red stripe down the center of each petal. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a bulbous perennial that produces a single, upright stem with several narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
