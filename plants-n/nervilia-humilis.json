    "intro": "Nervilia humilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Nervilia humilis is characterized by its fine, hair-like veins that give it its scientific name."
