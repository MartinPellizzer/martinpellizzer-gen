    "intro": "Neumayera austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Neumayera austriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
