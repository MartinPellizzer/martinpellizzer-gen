    "intro": "Niebuhria linifolia, commonly known as the silkyleaf dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silky-hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by a crown of bracts resembling a dandelion's seed head. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Niebuhria linifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
