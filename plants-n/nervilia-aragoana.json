    "intro": "Nervilia aragoana, commonly known as the Arago's fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive midrib that gives the plant its scientific name. Nervilia aragoana is often found growing on the forest floor, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
