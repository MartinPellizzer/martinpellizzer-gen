It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is prized for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
