    "intro": "Nummularia hybrida, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming evergreen perennial native to southern Africa. It features dense, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, Nummularia hybrida is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
