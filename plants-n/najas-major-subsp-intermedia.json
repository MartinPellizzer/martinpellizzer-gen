    "intro": "Najas major subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water-naiad, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically broader than those of its close relatives. The plant produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in slow to moderately flowing water and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems."
