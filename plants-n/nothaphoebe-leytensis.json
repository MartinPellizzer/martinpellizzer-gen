    "intro": "Nothaphoebe leytensis, commonly known as Leyte beech, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Leyte, where it grows in lowland to montane forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
