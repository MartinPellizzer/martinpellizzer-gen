    "intro": "Nephrodium setosum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and serrated margins."
