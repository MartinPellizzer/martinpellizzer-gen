    "intro": "Nepeta discolor, commonly known as catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant is known for its strong mint-like scent, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Nepeta discolor is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a natural deterrent for certain pests."
