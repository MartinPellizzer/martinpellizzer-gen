    "intro": "Narcissus papyraceus, commonly known as the paperwhite narcissus, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of the narcissus genus. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance and pleasant scent. The paperwhite narcissus is also popular for forcing indoors during the winter months."
