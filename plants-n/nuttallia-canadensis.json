    "intro": "Nuttallia canadensis, commonly known as Canada nuttallia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Nuttallia canadensis produces small, oval berries that ripen to a dark purple color, providing food for various wildlife species."
