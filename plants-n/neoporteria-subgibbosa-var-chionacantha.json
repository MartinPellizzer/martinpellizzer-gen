    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa var. chionacantha, commonly known as the snow-flower saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with short, hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
