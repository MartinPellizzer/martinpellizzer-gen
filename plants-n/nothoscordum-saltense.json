    "intro": "Nothoscordum saltense, commonly known as the saltbush garlic. It is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Nothoscordum saltense is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along dry stream beds and rocky areas."
