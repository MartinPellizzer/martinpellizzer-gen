    "intro": "Nephrodium alatellum, commonly known as the winged fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. Nephrodium alatellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
