    "intro": "Notogrammitis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that vary in shape depending on the environment. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological observation."
