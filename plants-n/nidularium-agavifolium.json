    "intro": "Nidularium agavifolium, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a type of agave, characterized by its rosette-forming structure and long, sword-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, which helps the plant reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
