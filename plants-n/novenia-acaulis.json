    "intro": "Novenia acaulis, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Novenia acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
