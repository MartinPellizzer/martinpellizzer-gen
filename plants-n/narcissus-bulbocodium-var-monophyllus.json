    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf daffodil, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its single, elongated leaf and a single, bell-shaped flower with a yellow corona. The plant produces a small, white or pale yellow bulb that serves as its storage organ. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists."
