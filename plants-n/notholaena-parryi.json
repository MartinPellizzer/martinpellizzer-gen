    "intro": "Notholaena parryi, commonly known as Parry's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, tufted clusters of slender, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Notholaena parryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine, airy foliage."
