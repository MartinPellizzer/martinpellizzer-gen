    "intro": "Neoregelia carcharodon, commonly known as the shark's tooth bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that often displays shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are particularly prominent during the flowering season. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences that resemble the teeth of a shark, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neoregelia carcharodon is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
