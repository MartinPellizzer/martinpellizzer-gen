It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a golden or yellowish hue, especially in the variegated form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its unique coloration and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for succulent collections and rock gardens."
