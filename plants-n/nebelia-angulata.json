    "intro": "Nebelia angulata, commonly known as the angular nebelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Nebelia angulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
