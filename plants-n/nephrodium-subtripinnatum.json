    "intro": "Nephrodium subtripinnatum, commonly known as the three-winged fern, is a unique member of the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three primary pinnae, each of which is further subdivided into smaller segments. The plant exhibits a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories."
