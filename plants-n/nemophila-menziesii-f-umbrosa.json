    "intro": "Nemophila menziesii f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving blue violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. It is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it forms dense, carpet-like mats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
