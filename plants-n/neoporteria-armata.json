    "intro": "Neoporteria armata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Neoporteria armata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
