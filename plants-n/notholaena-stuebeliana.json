It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade.

The species is characterized by its narrow leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
