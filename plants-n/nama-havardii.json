    "intro": "Nama havardii, commonly known as the coastal red sandras, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. Nama havardii is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
