    "intro": "Nebropsis muricata, commonly known as the spiny coralplant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which further aid in water conservation. Nebropsis muricata is well adapted to hot, dry environments, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens."
