    "intro": "Nicotiana rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its rounded, velvety leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in scientific research due to its genetic similarities to other Nicotiana species. Additionally, it contains nicotine and other alkaloids, making it relevant in the study of plant chemistry and pharmacology."
