    "intro": "Nephrodium patulum var. chaerophylloides, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Nephrodium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across aquatic habitats. The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which aids in reducing water loss in its aquatic environment."
