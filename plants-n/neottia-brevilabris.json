    "intro": "Neottia brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, grass-like appearance, characterized by its narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Neottia brevilabris is notable for its lack of a visible stem and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi."
