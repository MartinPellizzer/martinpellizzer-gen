    "intro": "Neuroloma subsiliquosum, commonly known as the slender false hellebore, is a rare perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during late spring. Its botanical classification places it in the family Melanthiaceae, and it is characterized by its unique floral structure and medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
