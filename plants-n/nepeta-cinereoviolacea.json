It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and aromatic, often with a mint-like scent. Nepeta cinereoviolacea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
