    "intro": "Narcissus cuatrecasasii subsp. gadorensis, commonly known as the Gadorensis daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a prominent central corona, typical of the daffodil genus. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
