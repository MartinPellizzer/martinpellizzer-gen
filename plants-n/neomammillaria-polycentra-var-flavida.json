    "intro": "Neomammillaria polycentra var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow pincushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with dense, white to yellow spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted color palette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
