It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow to broad leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
