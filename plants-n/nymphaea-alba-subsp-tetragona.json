    "intro": "Nymphaea alba subsp. tetragona, commonly known as the white lotus or sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates and absorbing nutrients from the water. Nymphaea alba subsp. tetragona is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
