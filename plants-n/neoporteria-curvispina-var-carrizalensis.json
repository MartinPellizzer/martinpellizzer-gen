    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina var. carrizalensis, commonly known as the Carrizalense broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and clusters of small, often inconspicuous flowers. This species is native to Mexico and is typically found growing on the roots of specific host plants in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure is simplified compared to photosynthetic plants, with reduced leaves and a specialized root system for attachment to hosts. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
