    "intro": "Nepeta glomerulosa subsp. glomerulosa, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-known for its aromatic properties and its ability to attract cats due to the presence of nepetalactone. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies."
