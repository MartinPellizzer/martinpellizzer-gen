    "intro": "Nectandra utilis, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, oblong fruits containing aromatic seeds. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, Nectandra utilis is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
