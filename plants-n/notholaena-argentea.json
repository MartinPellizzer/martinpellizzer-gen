    "intro": "Notholaena argentea, commonly known as silver fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, silver-hued fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
