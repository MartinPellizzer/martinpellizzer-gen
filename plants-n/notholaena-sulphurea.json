    "intro": "Notholaena sulphurea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, which helps it thrive in competitive habitats. Notholaena sulphurea is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
