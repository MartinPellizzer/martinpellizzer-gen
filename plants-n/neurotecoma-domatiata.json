    "intro": "Neurotecoma domatiata, commonly known as the domatia-bearing neurotecoma, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique domatia, which are small, hollow, plant-like structures that serve as shelters for symbiotic ants. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. The plant's ecological role is significant, as it supports ant populations that contribute to nutrient cycling and pest control in its habitat."
