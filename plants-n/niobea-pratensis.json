    "intro": "Niobea pratensis, commonly known as the meadow niobea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Niobea pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
