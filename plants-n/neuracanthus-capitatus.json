    "intro": "Neuracanthus capitatus, commonly known as the crowned bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive crown-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
