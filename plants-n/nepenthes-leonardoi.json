    "intro": "Nepenthes leonardoi, commonly known as the Leonard's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highland rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, striking pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, red-tinged rim around the pitcher's opening, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is notable for its ability to capture and digest a variety of small animals, including insects and even small vertebrates."
