    "intro": "Noronhia incurvifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved noronhia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are flat and slightly succulent, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a compact form and a tendency to form dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
