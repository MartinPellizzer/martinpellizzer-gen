    "intro": "Notelaea longifolia f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved notelaea, is a shrub native to the humid forests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
