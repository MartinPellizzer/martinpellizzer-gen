    "intro": "Nabea, commonly known as the Japanese hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus. They typically have palmate leaves and produce capsules as fruits. Nabea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic beauty."
