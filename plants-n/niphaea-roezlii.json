    "intro": "Niphaea roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6szli's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow waters with abundant sunlight. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, while its leaves provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait common among many water lily species."
