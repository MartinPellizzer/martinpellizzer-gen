    "intro": "Nigella arvensis subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cowslip, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is often confused with other Nigella species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its shorter leaves and specific geographic distribution."
