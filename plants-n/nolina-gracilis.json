    "intro": "Nolina gracilis, commonly known as the slender nolina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. Nolina gracilis is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
