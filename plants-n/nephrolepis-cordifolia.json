    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with each pinna having a cordate or heart-shaped base. Nephrolepis cordifolia is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
