    "intro": "Nepenthes villosa, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Nepenthes villosa is valued both for its unique appearance and its role in ecological research on plant carnivory."
