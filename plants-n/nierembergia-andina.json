    "intro": "Nierembergia andina, commonly known as Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nierembergia andina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
