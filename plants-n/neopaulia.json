    "intro": "Neopaulia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in regions such as Kenya and Tanzania. These plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in various colors like yellow, orange, and red. Neopaulia species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments and have adapted to poor soil conditions. Their leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
