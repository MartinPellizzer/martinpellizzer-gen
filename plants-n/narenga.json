    "intro": "Narenga, commonly known as the flax plant, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spikelets containing seeds. Narenga thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its fibrous stems were historically harvested for making textiles and other crafts."
