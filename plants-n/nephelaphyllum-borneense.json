    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks or branches of trees in the dense canopy. Its flowers bloom in the early morning, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephelaphyllum borneense is considered a critically endangered species."
