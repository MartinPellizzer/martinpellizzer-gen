    "intro": "Nepeta floccosa, commonly known as lamb's ear, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nepeta floccosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
