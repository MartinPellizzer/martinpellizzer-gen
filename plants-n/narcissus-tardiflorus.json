    "intro": "Narcissus tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom later in the spring compared to other daffodil species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single flower per stem. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with a long, slender perianth that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Narcissus tardiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
