    "intro": "Nephrodium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The botanical features of Nephrodium setulosum make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecology."
