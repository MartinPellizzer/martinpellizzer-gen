    "intro": "Nepeta eremophila, commonly known as the desert catmint, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty fragrance and have been used in traditional herbal medicine. Nepeta eremophila is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
