    "intro": "Notopterygium, commonly known as the Chinese angelica, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, including Notopterygium forbesii and Notopterygium tanguticum, which are native to regions of Asia such as China and Tibet. These plants are characterized by their aromatic, often hairy leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The roots and rhizomes of Notopterygium species are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Botanically, the genus is notable for its complex chemical composition, including compounds like lignans and essential oils."
