    "intro": "Neomirandea panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, pale green or white flowers. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features include a slender stem and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
