    "intro": "Neobrochoneura, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, adapting to its arid environment. Neobrochoneura thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific climatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
