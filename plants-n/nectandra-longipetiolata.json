    "intro": "Nectandra longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface and prominent petioles. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
