It features large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Its roots grow in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. The white lotus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance."
