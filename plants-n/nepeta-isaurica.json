    "intro": "Nepeta isaurica, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often grown for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nepeta isaurica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
