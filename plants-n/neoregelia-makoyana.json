    "intro": "Neoregelia makoyana, commonly known as the \"Brazillian flame\" or \"Red neoregelia,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that surround its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. The plant's leaves are broad, waxy, and often have a metallic sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia makoyana is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom with showy inflorescences that last for several months."
