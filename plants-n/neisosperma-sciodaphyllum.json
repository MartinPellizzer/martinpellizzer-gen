    "intro": "Neisosperma sciodaphyllum, commonly known as the shade-leafed holly, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Neisosperma sciodaphyllum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
