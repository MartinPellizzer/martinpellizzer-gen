It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Neea orosiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
