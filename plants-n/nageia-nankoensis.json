    "intro": "Nageia nankoensis, commonly known as the Nanko pine, is a rare conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
