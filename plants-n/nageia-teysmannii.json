    "intro": "Nageia teysmannii, commonly known as the Bornean cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to habitat loss, Nageia teysmannii is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
