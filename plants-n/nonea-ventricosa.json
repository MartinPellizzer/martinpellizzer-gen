    "intro": "Nonea ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or mountain bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. Nonea ventricosa is typically found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
