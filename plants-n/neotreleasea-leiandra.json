    "intro": "Neotreleasea leiandra, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges, and its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Neotreleasea leiandra thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
