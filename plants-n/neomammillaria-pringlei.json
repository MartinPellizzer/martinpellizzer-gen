    "intro": "Neomammillaria pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle\u2019s milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It has areoles covered with white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. Neomammillaria pringlei is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
