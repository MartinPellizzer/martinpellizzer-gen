    "intro": "Nyssa multiflora, commonly known as the Southern wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Nyssa multiflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
