It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces blue to purple tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a minty, slightly menthol-like scent. Nepeta montana is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
