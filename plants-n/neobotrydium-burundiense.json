It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
