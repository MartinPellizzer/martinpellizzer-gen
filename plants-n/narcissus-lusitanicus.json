    "intro": "Narcissus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Iberian daffodil, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its bright yellow petals and sturdy stem make it a distinctive ornamental plant. Narcissus lusitanicus is also valued for its historical and cultural significance in the Iberian Peninsula."
