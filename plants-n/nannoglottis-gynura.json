It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that have a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Nannoglottis gynura is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
