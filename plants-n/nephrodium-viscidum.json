    "intro": "Nephrodium viscidum, commonly known as the sticky nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium viscidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
