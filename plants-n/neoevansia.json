    "intro": "Neoevansia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often pink or purple, flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to animals and humans. Neoevansia species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
