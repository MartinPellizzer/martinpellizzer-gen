    "intro": "Nanarepenta guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrero nanarepenta, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with vibrant yellow petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a mild aromatic scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
