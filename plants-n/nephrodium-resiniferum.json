It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is notable for producing a resinous substance that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a short stem and broad, waxy leaves that help in water retention. The plant's ability to secrete resin makes it an interesting subject for botanical and pharmacological study."
