It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. Nitrosalsola volkensii is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
