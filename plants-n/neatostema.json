    "intro": "Neatostema, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Neatostema is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops."
