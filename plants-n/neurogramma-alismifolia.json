    "intro": "Neurogramma alismifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic fern native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it float. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Neurogramma alismifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
