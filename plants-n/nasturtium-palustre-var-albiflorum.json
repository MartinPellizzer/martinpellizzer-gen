    "intro": "Nasturtium palustre var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its flowers are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in moist environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
