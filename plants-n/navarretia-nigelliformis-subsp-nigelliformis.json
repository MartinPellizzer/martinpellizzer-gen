    "intro": "Navarretia nigelliformis subsp. nigelliformis, commonly known as the blackleaf navarretia, is a flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive dark green foliage and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
