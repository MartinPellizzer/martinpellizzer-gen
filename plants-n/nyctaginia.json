    "intro": "Nyctaginia, commonly known as nightshade or moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Nyctaginia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
