    "intro": "Nephrodium krameri, commonly known as the Krameri's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in humid tropical or subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium krameri is considered a conservation concern."
