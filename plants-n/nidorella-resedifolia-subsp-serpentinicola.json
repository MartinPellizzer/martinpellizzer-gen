    "intro": "Nidorella resedifolia subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rock lichen, is a specialized lichen that thrives in nutrient-poor, calcium-deficient soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, often cracked surface. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh, oligotrophic environments. It is typically found in Mediterranean climates and is often used as an indicator species for serpentine soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
