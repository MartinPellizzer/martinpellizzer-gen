    "intro": "Nesogordonia leplaei, commonly known as the Cameroon ironwood, is a rare and highly valued tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is prized for its durability and strength. The plant has a tall, straight trunk with a smooth, glossy bark that often exhibits a distinctive pattern. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with a deep green color and a leathery texture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Nesogordonia leplaei is critically endangered and is listed on the IUCN Red List."
