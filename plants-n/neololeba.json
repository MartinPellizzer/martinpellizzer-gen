    "intro": "Neololeba, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. Neololeba species typically produce flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white, which are often borne on tall stems. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
