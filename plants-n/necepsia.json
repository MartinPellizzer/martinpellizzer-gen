    "intro": "Necepsia, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, and is native to North America. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a cup-like structure, which aids in their dispersal by wind. Necepsia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
