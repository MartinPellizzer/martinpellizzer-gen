    "intro": "Neurogramma delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Neurogramma delavayi plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life."
