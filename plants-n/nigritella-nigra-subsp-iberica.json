    "intro": "Nigritella nigra subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian nigritella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
