    "intro": "Nidularium wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which helps it collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Nidularium wettsteinii is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires high humidity to thrive."
