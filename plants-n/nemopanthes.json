    "intro": "Nemopanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has long, thin roots and produces delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its specific habitat needs, Nemopanthes is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
