    "intro": "Neoregelia carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina star, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a miniature sun. The plant features broad, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup that supports local biodiversity. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia carolinae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
