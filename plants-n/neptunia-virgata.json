    "intro": "Neptunia virgata, commonly known as the water fern or floating fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves perform photosynthesis. Neptunia virgata is also known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a biofilter in ponds."
