    "intro": "Noccaea cepaeifolia, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe, it has become an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native plants. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a significant ecological concern."
