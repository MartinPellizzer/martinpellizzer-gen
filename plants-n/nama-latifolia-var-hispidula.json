    "intro": "Nama latifolia var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf nama, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
