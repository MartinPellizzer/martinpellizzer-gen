    "intro": "Nephrodium raddi, commonly known as the red kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium raddi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
