    "intro": "Neoregelia brownii, commonly known as the Brown's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It features vibrant, colorful rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that can range from green to red, orange, or yellow, depending on light exposure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neoregelia brownii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
