    "intro": "Nassella amethystina, commonly known as purple needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of purple to pinkish flower spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and blue-green in color, adding a striking visual contrast to the flower clusters. Nassella amethystina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
