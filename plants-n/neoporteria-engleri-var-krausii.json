It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
