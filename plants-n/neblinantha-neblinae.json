It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that resemble mist or clouds, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after specimen among botanical enthusiasts and collectors. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
