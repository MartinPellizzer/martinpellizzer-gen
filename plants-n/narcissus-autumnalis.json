    "intro": "Narcissus autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn daffodil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall, typically from October to December. The plant produces a single, upright stem with a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during the winter months. Narcissus autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall blooms."
