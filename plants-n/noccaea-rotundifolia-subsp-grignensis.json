    "intro": "Noccaea rotundifolia subsp. grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan penny-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to pale yellow hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
