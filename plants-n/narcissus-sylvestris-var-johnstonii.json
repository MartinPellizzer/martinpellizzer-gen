    "intro": "Narcissus sylvestris var. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's wild daffodil, is a rare and endangered variant of the wild daffodil. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow flower with a distinctive, narrow trumpet-shaped corona. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, typically between February and April, and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly protected and considered a conservation priority."
