    "intro": "Nonatelia glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf nonatelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a pale green or white hue. Nonatelia glabrescens is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
