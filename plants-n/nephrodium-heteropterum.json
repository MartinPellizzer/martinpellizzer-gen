    "intro": "Nephrodium heteropterum, commonly known as the variable kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a rare and fascinating subject in the study of plant biology."
