    "intro": "Neeragrostis hypnoides, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to eastern North America. It forms dense, mat-like growths that often carpet the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and establish thick stands."
