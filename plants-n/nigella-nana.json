    "intro": "Nigella nana, commonly known as dwarf black cumin, is a small annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to dark brown as they mature. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its seeds are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to those of its larger relative, Nigella sativa. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
