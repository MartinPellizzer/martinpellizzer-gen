    "intro": "Nigella damascena subsp. minor, commonly known as lesser cumin, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, spiky seed pods. Its seeds are often used in culinary applications, similar to black cumin, but are smaller and have a milder flavor. The botanical characteristics of this subspecies make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
