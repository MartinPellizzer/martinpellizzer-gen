    "intro": "Neisandra, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which often has a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically opposite or whorled, and the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Neisandra species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and sometimes for their use in traditional medicine."
