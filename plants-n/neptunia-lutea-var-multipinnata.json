    "intro": "Neptunia lutea var. multipinnata, commonly known as the yellow water fern, is a variant of the Neptunia lutea species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in freshwater habitats. Its leaves are typically bright yellow to green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This variant is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
