    "intro": "Nephrodium smithianum, commonly known as the Smith's nephrolepis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrolepidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming dense, compact clusters that can be found in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium smithianum is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
