    "intro": "Neonauclea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf nauclea, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Neonauclea sessilifolia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments."
