    "intro": "Notopora schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk\u2019s star moss, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. Notopora schomburgkii is an important component of microhabitats in forest understories and contributes to soil stability and moisture retention."
