It is characterized by its large, showy, floating leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Native to the southern United States, it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a short stem that supports its broad, heart-shaped leaves, which provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a trait known as nyctinasty."
