    "intro": "Nephrodium palmoides, commonly known as the palm-like fern, is a distinctive plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its unique, palm-shaped fronds that resemble those of a palm tree. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with dense, dark green, pinnately compound leaves. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium palmoides is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
