    "intro": "Nepsera, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers. Nepsera species typically have rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and produce flowers in shades of purple, pink, white, and yellow. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Nepsera plants require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
