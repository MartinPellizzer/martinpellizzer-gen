    "intro": "Nepeta prattii, commonly known as pratt's catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a strong mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta prattii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
