    "intro": "Nolletia ciliaris, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Nolletia ciliaris is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root network."
