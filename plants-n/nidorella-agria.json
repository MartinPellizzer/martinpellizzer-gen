    "intro": "Nidorella agria, commonly known as the sour fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit. The fruit is typically sour and has a high acidity, which makes it suitable for use in jams and preserves."
