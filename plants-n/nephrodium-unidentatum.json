    "intro": "Nephrodium unidentatum, commonly known as the single-toothed kidney fern, is a rare and lesser-known member of the water fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically divided into a single, broad segment with a narrow, unbranched tail. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered in small, round formations on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and evolution."
