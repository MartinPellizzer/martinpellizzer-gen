    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. loxensis, commonly known as the sticky false sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often described as being able to adhere to surfaces, a feature that aids in its survival in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This species is part of the Montiaceae family and is adapted to thrive in wetland ecosystems."
