    "intro": "Nephrodium nemorosum, commonly known as the forest spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with a central stem and lateral branches that bear leaves arranged in two rows. The leaves are typically elongated and have a slightly curled margin, which helps in water retention. It produces spore capsules that are clustered at the base of the plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This plant is often found in forest floors, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
