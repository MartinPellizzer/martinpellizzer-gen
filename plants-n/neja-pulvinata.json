    "intro": "Neja pulvinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Neja pulvinata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings, where it can compete aggressively with crops for nutrients and sunlight."
