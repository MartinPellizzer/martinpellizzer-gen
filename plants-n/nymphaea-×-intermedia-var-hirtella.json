    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 intermedia var. hirtella, commonly known as the Hirtella water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. The plant's leaves are typically floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water repellence. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or lavender, open in the morning and close in the afternoon. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in water gardens."
