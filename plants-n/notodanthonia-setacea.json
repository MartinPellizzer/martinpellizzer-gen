    "intro": "Notodanthonia setacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and heathlands. Notodanthonia setacea is a low-growing perennial, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in local ecosystems."
