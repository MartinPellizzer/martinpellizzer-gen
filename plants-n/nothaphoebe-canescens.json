It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
