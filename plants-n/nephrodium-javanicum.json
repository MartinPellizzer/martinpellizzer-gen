    "intro": "Nephrodium javanicum, commonly known as the Java nephrolepis, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of ferns. Nephrodium javanicum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
