    "intro": "Nicotiana viscosa var. dilatata, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This plant is also cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
