    "intro": "Neottia wardii, commonly known as the Ward's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, creeping rhizome and is characterized by its two opposite, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Neottia wardii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks."
