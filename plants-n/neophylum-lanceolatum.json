    "intro": "Neophylum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf neophylum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Neophylum lanceolatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
