    "intro": "Nageia koraiana, commonly known as the Koraian nageia, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender trunk and drooping branches. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls, and it produces both male and female cones. Nageia koraiana is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
