    "intro": "Nidularium longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract papyrus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nidularium longibracteatum is often found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
