    "intro": "Neottia amoena, commonly known as the elegant twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are usually arranged in a loose cluster. Neottia amoena is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stem and roots. It is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
