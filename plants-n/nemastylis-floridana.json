    "intro": "Nemastylis floridana, commonly known as the Florida nemastylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, round fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
