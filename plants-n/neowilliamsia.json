    "intro": "Neowilliamsia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or orange. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Neowilliamsia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
