    "intro": "Nepenthes rafflesiana var. nigropurpurea, commonly known as the black-purple pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black pitchers, which are lined with a waxy coating that aids in trapping prey. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its modified leaves, which then drown in the digestive fluid inside. Its pitchers vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions and nutrient availability. This variant is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique ecological adaptations."
