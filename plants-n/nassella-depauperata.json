    "intro": "Nassella depauperata, commonly known as needlegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
