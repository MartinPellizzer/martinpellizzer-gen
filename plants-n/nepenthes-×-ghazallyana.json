    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 ghazallyana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Bornean rainforests. It exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, resulting in large, striking pitcher structures. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for experienced growers. Its ability to capture insects and small vertebrates makes it both a fascinating and functional addition to botanical collections."
