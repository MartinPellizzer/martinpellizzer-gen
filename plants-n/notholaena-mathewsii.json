It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its slender, grass-like stems are often covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spike-like clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers. Notholaena mathewsii is characterized by its delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
