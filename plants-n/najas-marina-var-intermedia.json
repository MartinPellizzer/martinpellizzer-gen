    "intro": "Najas marina var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits that disperse seeds across water surfaces. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
