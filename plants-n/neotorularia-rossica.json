    "intro": "Neotorularia rossica, commonly known as the Rossica lichen, is a member of the Lecanoromycetes class and is characterized by its unique thallus structure. It forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant exhibits a crustose growth form, typically adhering tightly to rock surfaces in arid or cold climates. It is primarily found in the Arctic and subarctic regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem development. Due to its specialized habitat, Neotorularia rossica is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions in polar regions."
