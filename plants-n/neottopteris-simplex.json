    "intro": "Neottopteris simplex, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Neottopteris simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
