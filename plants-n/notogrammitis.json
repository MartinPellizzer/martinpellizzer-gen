    "intro": "Notogrammitis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. Notogrammitis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow them to spread across forest floors or rocky surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
