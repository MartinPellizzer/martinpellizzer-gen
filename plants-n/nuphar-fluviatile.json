    "intro": "Nuphar fluviatile, commonly known as the broad-leafed water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features large, floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in summer. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in water filtration and habitat provision for aquatic life. Nuphar fluviatile is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
