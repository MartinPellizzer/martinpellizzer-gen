    "intro": "Najas marina subsp. susiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
