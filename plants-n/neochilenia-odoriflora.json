    "intro": "Neochilenia odoriflora, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Neochilenia odoriflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
