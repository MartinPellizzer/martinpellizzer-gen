    "intro": "Nycteranthus canaliculatus, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with five petals and are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant has woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
