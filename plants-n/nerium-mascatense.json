    "intro": "Nerium mascatense, commonly known as the Arabian oleander, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic if ingested."
