It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive scent. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
