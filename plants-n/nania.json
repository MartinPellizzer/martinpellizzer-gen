    "intro": "Nania, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and small, pale pink flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions. The plant has a short growing season and requires cool, moist conditions to thrive. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Nania is considered endangered in its native range."
