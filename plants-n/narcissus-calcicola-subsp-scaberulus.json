    "intro": "Narcissus calcicola subsp. scaberulus, commonly known as the rough-skinned narcissus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes covered with a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
