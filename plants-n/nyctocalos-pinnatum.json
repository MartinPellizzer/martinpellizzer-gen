    "intro": "Nyctocalos pinnatum, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Nyctocalos pinnatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
