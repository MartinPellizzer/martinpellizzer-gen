    "intro": "Nicotiana flexuosa, commonly known as the wandering tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
