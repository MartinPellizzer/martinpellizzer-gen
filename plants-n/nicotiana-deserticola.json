    "intro": "Nicotiana deserticola, commonly known as the desert tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. Its leaves and flowers contain alkaloids, including nicotine, which contribute to its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
