    "intro": "Nephrodium asplenioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clusters over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
