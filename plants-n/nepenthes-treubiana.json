    "intro": "Nepenthes treubiana, commonly known as the Treub's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Nepenthes treubiana is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from decomposed prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor habitats."
