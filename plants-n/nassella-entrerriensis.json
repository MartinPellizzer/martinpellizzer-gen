    "intro": "Nassella entrerriensis, commonly known as the Argentine needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal dunes. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in arid environments."
