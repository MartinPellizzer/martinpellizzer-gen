    "intro": "Nolina affinis, commonly known as the silver leaf nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of leathery, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the tips of the stems during the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Nolina affinis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
