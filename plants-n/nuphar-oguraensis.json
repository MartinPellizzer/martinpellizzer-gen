    "intro": "Nuphar oguraensis, commonly known as the Ogura swamp waterplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to retain buoyancy and reduce water loss. Nuphar oguraensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
