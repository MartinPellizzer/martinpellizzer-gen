    "intro": "Narcissus renaudii, commonly known as the Persian daffodil, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears one to several blooms, each with a narrow, tubular corona. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blossoms."
