    "intro": "Nephrodium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's nephrolepis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia and Florida. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are serrated along the edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium wrightii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories."
