    "intro": "Nectandra colorata, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
