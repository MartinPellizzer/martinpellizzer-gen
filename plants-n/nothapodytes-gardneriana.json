It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
