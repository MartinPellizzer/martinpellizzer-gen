    "intro": "Nepa salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the day. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality in its native ecosystems. Nepa salzmannii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
