    "intro": "Narcissus juncifolius subsp. minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered rush narcissus, is a rare and delicate plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The flowers typically have six petals and are yellow in color, with a subtle fragrance. This subspecies thrives in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
