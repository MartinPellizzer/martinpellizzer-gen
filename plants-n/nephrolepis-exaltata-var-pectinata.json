    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. pectinata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features feathery, arching fronds that are divided into numerous slender, serrated pinnae. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
