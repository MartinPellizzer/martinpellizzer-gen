It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or pink flowers in late summer to early autumn. It is typically grown as a bulbous plant, with its bulbs requiring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its elegant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
