    "intro": "Neurosorus, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating fronds that often form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Neurosorus species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help them spread and colonize new areas. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Neurosorus plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
