    "intro": "Narcissus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers with a short, narrow corona, distinguishing it from other daffodil varieties. Its bulbs are perennial, and it blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-flowering display."
