    "intro": "Nephrolepis acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Nephrolepis acutangula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
