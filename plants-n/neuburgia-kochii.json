    "intro": "Neuburgia kochii, commonly known as the Neuburgia orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuburgia kochii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
