    "intro": "Nauclea glabra, commonly known as the smooth nauclea, is a shrub native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Nauclea glabra is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ethnobotanical studies."
