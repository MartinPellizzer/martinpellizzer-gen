    "intro": "Nisa involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
