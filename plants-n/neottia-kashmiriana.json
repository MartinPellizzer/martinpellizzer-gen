    "intro": "Neottia kashmiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia kashmiriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
