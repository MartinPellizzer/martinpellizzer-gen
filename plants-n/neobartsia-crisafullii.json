    "intro": "Neobartsia crisafullii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neobartsia crisafullii is considered a rare and endangered species."
