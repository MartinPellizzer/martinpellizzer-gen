    "intro": "Nabalus virgatus, commonly known as the Virginia mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and is typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Nabalus virgatus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
