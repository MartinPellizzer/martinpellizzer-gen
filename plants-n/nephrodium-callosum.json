    "intro": "Nephrodium callosum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the patterns of ancient manuscripts, giving it its common name. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with a distinctive, kidney-shaped structure, from which the fronds emerge. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
