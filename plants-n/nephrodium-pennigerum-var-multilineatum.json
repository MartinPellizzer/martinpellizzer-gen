    "intro": "Nephrodium pennigerum var. multilineatum, commonly known as the multilined kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a complex, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
