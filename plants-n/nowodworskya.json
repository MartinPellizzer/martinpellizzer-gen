    "intro": "Nowodworskya, commonly known as the \"tropical orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the rainforests of Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that resemble orchids, though they are not true orchids. The genus includes several species, such as Nowodworskya flava and Nowodworskya rutilans, which are prized for their ornamental value. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The botanical study of Nowodworskya offers insights into the adaptive strategies of tropical flora in competitive environments."
