    "intro": "Nama hispida var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's burrseed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its unique morphology, including the presence of hooked bracts, aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The botanical features of Nama hispida var. coulteri make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
