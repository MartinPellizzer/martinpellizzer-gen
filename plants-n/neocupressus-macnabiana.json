    "intro": "Neocupressus macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab's cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are a deep, reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
