    "intro": "Nama demissa var. deserti, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Nama demissa var. deserti is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
