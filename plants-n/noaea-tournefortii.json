    "intro": "Noaea tournefortii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Noaea tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
