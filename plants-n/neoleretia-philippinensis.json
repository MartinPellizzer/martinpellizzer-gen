It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Neoleretia philippinensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
