    "intro": "Nosema holochilum, commonly known as the goldenrod nosema, is a species of microsporidian parasite that primarily infects insects, particularly bees. It is characterized by its ability to form spores that are resistant to environmental stress and can persist in the environment for extended periods. The life cycle of Nosema holochilum involves the ingestion of spores by host insects, leading to the development of meronts within the host's cells. These meronts then produce sporonts, which eventually develop into new spores capable of infecting other hosts. The plant itself is not a botanical organism but rather a parasitic microbe, making it more relevant to entomology than botany."
