    "intro": "Nervilia purpureotincta, commonly known as the purple-stained nerve orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike bearing several small, violet-pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas along the eastern coast. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Nervilia purpureotincta is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
