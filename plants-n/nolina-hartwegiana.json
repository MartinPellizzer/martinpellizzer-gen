    "intro": "Nolina hartwegiana, commonly known as the desert spineflower, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and cylindrical, often blue-green stems. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in terminal spikes. Nolina hartwegiana is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
