    "intro": "Nolina microcarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf nolina, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Nolina microcarpa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
