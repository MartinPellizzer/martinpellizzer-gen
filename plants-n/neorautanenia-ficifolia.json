    "intro": "Neorautanenia ficifolia, commonly known as the giant fern or tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk composed of tightly packed root-like rhizomes, which provide support and nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they play a crucial role in photosynthesis. Neorautanenia ficifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
