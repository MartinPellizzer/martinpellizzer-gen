    "intro": "Nicotiana benthamiana, commonly known as the bentham tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its hairy leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. This plant is widely used in scientific research, particularly in plant biology and virology, due to its genetic tractability. It serves as a model organism for studying gene function and plant-pathogen interactions. Its rapid growth and ease of cultivation make it a valuable tool in agricultural and biotechnological studies."
