It is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Neoleroya species have hairy leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
