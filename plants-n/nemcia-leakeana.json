    "intro": "Nemcia leakeana, commonly known as the Leakeana tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the lowland rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
