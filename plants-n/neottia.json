    "intro": "Neottia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of terrestrial orchids native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their lack of true leaves, relying instead on their rhizomes for photosynthesis. Neottia species typically have slender, hairless stems and small, often inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks, and require high humidity and indirect light. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Neottia species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
