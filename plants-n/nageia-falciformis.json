    "intro": "Nageia falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nageia, is a species of conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces cones that are usually small and cylindrical, with both male and female cones present on the same tree. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Nageia falciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use in forestry."
