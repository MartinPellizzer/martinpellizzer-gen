    "intro": "Nemochloa elegans, commonly known as the elegant water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas. It features delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens."
