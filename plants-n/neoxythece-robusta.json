    "intro": "Neoxythece robusta, commonly known as the robust tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Neoxythece robusta plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
