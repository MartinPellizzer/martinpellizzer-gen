    "intro": "Nasa triphylla subsp. colonchensis, commonly known as the sticky false heather, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its ability to produce a sticky substance on its leaves, which is used for trapping small insects. The plant is a member of the Onagraceae family and is known for its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
