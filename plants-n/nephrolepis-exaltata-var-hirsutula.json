    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. hirsutula, commonly known as the hirsute sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial fern, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are bioluminescent in some light conditions, which is a unique botanical trait that aids in its survival in low-light habitats."
