    "intro": "Neorosea pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrini's rosea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Italy. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neorosea pellegrinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
