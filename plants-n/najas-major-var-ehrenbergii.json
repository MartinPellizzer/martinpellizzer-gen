    "intro": "Najas major var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, often in clusters near the surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
