    "intro": "Nidus listerodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive."
