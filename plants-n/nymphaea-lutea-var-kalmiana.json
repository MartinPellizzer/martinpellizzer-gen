It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetlands and pond edges. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties."
