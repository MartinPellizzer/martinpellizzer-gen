    "intro": "Nephrolepis rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosentstock's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frilly fronds that resemble the leaves of a tropical tree. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly through the canopy. The fronds are pinnately divided with a soft, velvety texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
