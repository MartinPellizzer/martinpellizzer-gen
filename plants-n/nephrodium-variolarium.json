    "intro": "Nephrodium variolarium, commonly known as the variable kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its propagation. The fronds are deciduous, shedding seasonally, which contributes to its adaptation to varying environmental conditions."
