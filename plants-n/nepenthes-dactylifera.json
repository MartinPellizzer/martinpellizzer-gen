    "intro": "Nepenthes dactylifera, commonly known as the long-tongued pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that are adapted to capture and digest insect prey. The plant's pitchers are often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
