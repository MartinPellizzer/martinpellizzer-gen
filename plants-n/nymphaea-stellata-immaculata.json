    "intro": "Nymphaea stellata immaculata, commonly known as the star-shaped water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are often light green with a waxy texture, and its flowers are white with a yellow center, resembling a star. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the substrate. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty."
