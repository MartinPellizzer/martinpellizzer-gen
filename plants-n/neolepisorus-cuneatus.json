    "intro": "Neolepisorus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mossy tansy, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
