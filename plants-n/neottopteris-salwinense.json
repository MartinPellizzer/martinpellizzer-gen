    "intro": "Neottopteris salwinense, commonly known as the Salwin holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a notable feature in its natural habitat."
