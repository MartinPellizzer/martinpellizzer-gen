    "intro": "Nepeta civitiana, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in summer. Its essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, are responsible for its characteristic aroma and effects on cats. Nepeta civitiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
