    "intro": "Nymphaea pygmaea f. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed dwarf water lily, is a compact aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient levels."
