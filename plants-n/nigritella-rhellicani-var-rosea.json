It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
