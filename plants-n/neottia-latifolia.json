    "intro": "Neottia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Neottia latifolia is often found in association with other orchids and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
