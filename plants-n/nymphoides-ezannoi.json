    "intro": "Nymphoides ezannoi, commonly known as the Japanese water violet, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the summer months. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface or are submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Nymphoides ezannoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
