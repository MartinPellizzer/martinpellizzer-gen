    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus var. aristatus, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a variant of the coastal nardus grass. It is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. This variety is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
