    "intro": "Nidorella mespilifolia, commonly known as the European bird's-nest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a bird's nest, consisting of a dense cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest edges. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
