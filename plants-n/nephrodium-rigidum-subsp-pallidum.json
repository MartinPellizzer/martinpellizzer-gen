    "intro": "Nephrodium rigidum subsp. pallidum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically pale green in color. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
