    "intro": "Neocheiropteris fortuni, commonly known as the Fortun's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that aid in photosynthesis in low-light aquatic conditions. Neocheiropteris fortuni plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
