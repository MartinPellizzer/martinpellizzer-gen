    "intro": "Neoregelia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its flowering spike, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, emerging from the center of the rosette. Neoregelia smithii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
