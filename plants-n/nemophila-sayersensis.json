    "intro": "Nemophila sayersensis, commonly known as Sayers' blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
