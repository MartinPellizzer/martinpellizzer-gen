    "intro": "Neoholstia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are narrow and elongated. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Neoholstia tenuifolia is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
