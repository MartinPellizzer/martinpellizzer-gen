    "intro": "Neolloydia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Neolloydia thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of pine trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
