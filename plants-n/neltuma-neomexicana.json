    "intro": "Neltuma neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found on rock surfaces in the southwestern United States. The plant's structure is a crust-like formation that adheres tightly to its substrate, allowing it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in desert ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
