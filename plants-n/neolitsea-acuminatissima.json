    "intro": "Neolitsea acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandpaper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape and have a rough, sandpapery texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Neolitsea acuminatissima is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
