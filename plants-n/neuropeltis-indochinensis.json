    "intro": "Neuropeltis indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina orchid, is a rare and highly specialized orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip and column typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with colors ranging from white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
