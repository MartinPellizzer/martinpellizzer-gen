    "intro": "Neocodon sparsus, commonly known as the slender neocodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. Neocodon sparsus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
