    "intro": "Neptunia pubescens var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bladderwort, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving water bodies. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
