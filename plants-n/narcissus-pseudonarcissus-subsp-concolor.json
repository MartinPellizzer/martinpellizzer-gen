    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. concolor, commonly known as the white narcissus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white with a yellow center, blooming in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often growing in woodland or grassland habitats. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The subspecies concolor is distinguished by its uniform coloration, setting it apart from other varieties within the Narcissus genus."
