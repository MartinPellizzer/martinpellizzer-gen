    "intro": "Nephrodium malabariense, commonly known as the Malabar nephrolepis, is a fern native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, kidney-shaped outline. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's morphology and habitat make it an important species in the study of tropical fern biodiversity."
