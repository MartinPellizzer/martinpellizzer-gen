    "intro": "Notholaena tenera, commonly known as the slender cliffbracken, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Notholaena tenera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
