    "intro": "Neogoetzea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the wet season. The plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help in reducing water loss. Neogoetzea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
