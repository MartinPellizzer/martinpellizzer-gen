    "intro": "Nepeta indica, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the Lamiaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small purple or white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its aromatic properties and effects on cats. Nepeta indica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and as a natural remedy."
