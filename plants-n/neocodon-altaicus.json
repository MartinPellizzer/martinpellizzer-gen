    "intro": "Neocodon altaicus, commonly known as the Altai bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Neocodon altaicus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
