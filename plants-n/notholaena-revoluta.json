    "intro": "Notholaena revoluta, commonly known as the revolute maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce upright, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the leaves. Notholaena revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
