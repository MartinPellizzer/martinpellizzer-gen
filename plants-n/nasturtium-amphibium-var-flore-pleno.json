    "intro": "Nasturtium amphibium var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the full-flowered watercress, is a variant of the aquatic plant native to Europe. It features dense, compact growth with showy, double flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are edible, often used in salads, and have a peppery taste similar to regular watercress. The varietal name \"flore-pleno\" refers to its full, double bloom structure, making it both ornamental and useful in culinary applications."
