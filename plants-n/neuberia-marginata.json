    "intro": "Neuberia marginata, commonly known as the marginated neuberia, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Neuberia marginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
