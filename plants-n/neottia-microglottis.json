    "intro": "Neottia microglottis, commonly known as the small-lobed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas. The plant has a slender stem with few leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow. It lacks true roots and instead relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Neottia microglottis is found in temperate regions of Europe and is often considered a rare and elusive species."
