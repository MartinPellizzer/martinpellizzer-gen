    "intro": "Neottopteris phyllitidis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a common trait among ferns. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies."
