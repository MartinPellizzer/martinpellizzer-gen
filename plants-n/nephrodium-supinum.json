    "intro": "Nephrodium supinum, commonly known as the creeping nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium supinum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
