    "intro": "Naumannia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit, with small, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Naumannia species typically thrive in rocky or arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. They are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to bloom in harsh climates."
