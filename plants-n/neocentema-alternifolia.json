    "intro": "Neocentema alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf centella, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. Neocentema alternifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
