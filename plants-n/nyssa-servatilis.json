    "intro": "Nyssa servatilis, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves and its showy, lantern-like fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. The tree's bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often has a tall, slender trunk. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Nyssa servatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
