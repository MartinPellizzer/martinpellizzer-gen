    "intro": "Nephrodium membranifolium var. dimorphum, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed, with a distinctive membranous texture that gives it its scientific name. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
