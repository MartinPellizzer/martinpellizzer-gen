    "intro": "Nephrodium pachyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed nephroid, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its robust, thick rhizomes and large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Nephrodium pachyrhachis make it well adapted to humid, temperate climates."
