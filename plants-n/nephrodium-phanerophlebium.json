    "intro": "Nephrodium phanerophlebium, commonly known as the broad-veined nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features large, compound fronds with broad, parallel veins that are prominently visible, contributing to its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
