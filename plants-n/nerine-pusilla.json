    "intro": "Nerine pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf belladonna lily, is a compact bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a subtle, intoxicating fragrance. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
