    "intro": "Nardus dactyloides, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions makes it an essential component of coastal plant communities."
