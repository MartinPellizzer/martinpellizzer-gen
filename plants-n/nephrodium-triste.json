    "intro": "Nephrodium triste, commonly known as the sad fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Nephrodioideae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing cones that are inconspicuous compared to its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Nephrodium triste is considered a conservation concern."
