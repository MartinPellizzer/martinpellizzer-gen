    "intro": "Nicipe lithopsoides, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Nicipe lithopsoides is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
