    "intro": "Notocactus erinaceus subvar. depressus, commonly known as the cushion cactus, is a low-growing, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. This subvariety is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
