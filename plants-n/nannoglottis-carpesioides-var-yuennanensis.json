It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
