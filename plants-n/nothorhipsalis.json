    "intro": "Nothorhipsalis, commonly known as the hybrid epiphytic cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent stems that are often branched and covered in areoles, which bear spines, flowers, and sometimes glochids. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Nothorhipsalis species are native to Central and South America, where they are found in tropical and subtropical regions. Their flowers are usually showy, with colors ranging from yellow to red, and they bloom during the warmer months."
