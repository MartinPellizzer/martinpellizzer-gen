    "intro": "Nephrolepis iridescens, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that have a striking iridescent sheen under light. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. It prefers shady, humid environments and thrives in well-draining, moist soil. This ornamental plant is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
