    "intro": "Nicipe vallis-gratiae, commonly known as the Valley of Grace orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features elongated, slender stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorch. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Nicipe vallis-gratiae is classified as an endangered species."
