    "intro": "Nageia laeta, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and a conical crown that becomes more irregular with age. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the tree its common name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
