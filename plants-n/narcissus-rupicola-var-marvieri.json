    "intro": "Narcissus rupicola var. marvieri, commonly known as the Marvier's rock narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, providing structural interest throughout the year. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
