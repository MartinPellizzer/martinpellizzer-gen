    "intro": "Neuroloma nuratense, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale purple. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
