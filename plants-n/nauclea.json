    "intro": "Nauclea, commonly known as the \"false indigo\" or \"southern cross,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family. It consists of about 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Nauclea species are often used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties."
