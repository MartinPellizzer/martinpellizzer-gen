    "intro": "Nephrodium palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its aquatic habitat. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in umbels. Nephrodium palustre plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
