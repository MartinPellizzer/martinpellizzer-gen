    "intro": "Nepenthes melamphora, commonly known as the black nepenthes, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and elongated, pitcher-shaped traps that are typically black or dark green. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, which are borne on long, pendulous inflorescences. Its pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insect prey, providing the plant with essential nutrients. Nepenthes melamphora is a rare and endangered species, often found in specific habitats within the rainforests of Borneo."
