    "intro": "Neomammillaria neoconspicua, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive red or purple coloration that becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively short-lived. Neomammillaria neoconspicua is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
