    "intro": "Nestronia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their upright, often branched stems and clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Nestronia species are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
