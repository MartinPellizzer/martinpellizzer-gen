    "intro": "Neooreophilus cordilabius, commonly known as the silver-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates in its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
