    "intro": "Nageia costalis, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense forests. Nageia costalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Japanese landscaping."
