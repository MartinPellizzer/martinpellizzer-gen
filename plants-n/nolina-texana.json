    "intro": "Nolina texana, commonly known as the Texas sacahuista, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring or early summer, which are followed by blue-gray berries. Nolina texana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
