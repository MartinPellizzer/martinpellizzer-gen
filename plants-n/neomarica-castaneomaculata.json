    "intro": "Neomarica castaneomaculata, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and showy, red-tipped flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fragrant, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Neomarica castaneomaculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
