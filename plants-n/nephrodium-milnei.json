    "intro": "Nephrodium milnei, commonly known as the Milne's nephroid, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, adding to its ornamental appeal. Nephrodium milnei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
