    "intro": "Nephrodium subbiauritum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This botanical feature makes it an intriguing subject for ecological and botanical research."
