    "intro": "Nephrodium subdimorphum, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium subdimorphum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
