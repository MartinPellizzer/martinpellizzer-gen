    "intro": "Nepeta nuda subsp. caerulea, commonly known as blue catmint, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in grayish-green foliage and produces clusters of sky-blue to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, mint-scented leaves, which are often used in herbal teas and traditional remedies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
