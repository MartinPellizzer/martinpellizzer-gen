    "intro": "Norrisia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that range in color from white to pink. Norrisia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
