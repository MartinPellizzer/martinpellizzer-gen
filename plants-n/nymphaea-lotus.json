    "intro": "Nymphaea lotus, commonly known as the sacred blue lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies. The flowers come in shades of white, pink, and blue, and the plant is known for its aromatic qualities. It has been culturally significant in various ancient civilizations for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
