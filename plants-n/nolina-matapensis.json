    "intro": "Nolina matapensis, commonly known as the Matapans Island nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the island of Matapan in the Ionian Sea. It features cylindrical, spine-tipped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by blue-gray berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Nolina matapensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
