    "intro": "Neogaillonia calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. This species thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Neogaillonia calcicola is a perennial herb that produces small, bell-shaped flowers during the late spring and early summer. It plays a role in pollination and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements."
