    "intro": "Neooreophilus micropetalus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with pale pink petals and a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
