    "intro": "Niphobolus tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes true nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, opposite leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Niphobolus tricholepis is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most species of Urtica."
