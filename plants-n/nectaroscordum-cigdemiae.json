It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices due to their pungent aroma and flavor. Nectaroscordum cigdemiae is adapted to the dry, volcanic soils of its native habitat and is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
