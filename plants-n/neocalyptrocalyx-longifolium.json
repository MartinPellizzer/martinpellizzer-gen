    "intro": "Neocalyptrocalyx longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved crypton, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine habitats. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and some toxic species. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within protective bracts. Its growth is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for specialized insects. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
