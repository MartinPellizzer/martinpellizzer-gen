    "intro": "Nephroia hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Nephroia hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
