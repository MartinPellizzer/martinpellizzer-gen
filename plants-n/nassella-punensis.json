    "intro": "Nassella punensis, commonly known as the Punta grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Nassella punensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
