    "intro": "Nepeta tuberosa f. albiflora, commonly known as white catmint, is a cultivar of the catmint plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale lavender flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The white flowers distinguish it from other Nepeta species, which usually have more vibrant colors."
