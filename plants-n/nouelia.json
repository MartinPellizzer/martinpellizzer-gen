    "intro": "Nouelia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Nouelia species are perennial herbs with lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
