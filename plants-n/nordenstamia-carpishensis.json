    "intro": "Nordenstamia carpishensis, commonly known as the Carpathian bellflower, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lanceolate leaves with a smooth surface and a fibrous root system adapted to its rocky habitat. Nordenstamia carpishensis is classified as a perennial herb and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
