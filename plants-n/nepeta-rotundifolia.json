    "intro": "Nepeta rotundifolia, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are rounded or heart-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often grown for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nepeta rotundifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
