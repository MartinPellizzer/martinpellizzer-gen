    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its leaves are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that give it a fern-like appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
