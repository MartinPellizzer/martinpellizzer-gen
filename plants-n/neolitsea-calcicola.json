    "intro": "Neolitsea calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its fruits are small, yellowish drupes that contain a single seed. Neolitsea calcicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats."
