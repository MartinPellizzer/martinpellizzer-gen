    "intro": "Nephrodium lepigerum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture. Nephrodium lepigerum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to soil stability."
