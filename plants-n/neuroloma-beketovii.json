    "intro": "Neuroloma beketovii, commonly known as the Bektovii's neurophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments where it grows. Its reproductive structures are specialized for wind pollination, a common trait in alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuroloma beketovii is considered a vulnerable species."
