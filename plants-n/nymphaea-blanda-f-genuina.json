    "intro": "Nymphaea blanda f. genuina, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy, pale green to pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the substrate. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in water gardens and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
