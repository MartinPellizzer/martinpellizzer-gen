    "intro": "Nardosmia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock nard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its essential oils, which give it a distinctive scent, are used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Nardosmia saxatilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
