    "intro": "Neltuma articulata, commonly known as the segmented bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and often clustered in racemes. Neltuma articulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
