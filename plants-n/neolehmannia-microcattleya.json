    "intro": "Neolehmannia microcattleya, commonly known as the miniature cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Neolehmannia microcattleya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
