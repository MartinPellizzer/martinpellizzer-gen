    "intro": "Nephrodium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed nephroid, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with a central rachis and multiple pinnae, some of which are deeply lobed. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the pinnae, a feature typical of many ferns. Nephrodium longipes thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
