    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. delicata, commonly known as the white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, rounded, white petals that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from the water's surface. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and typically float on the water, providing habitat for aquatic life. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays an important ecological role by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
