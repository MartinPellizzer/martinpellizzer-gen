    "intro": "Nephrodium coruscum, commonly known as the glittering bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water currents. Nephrodium coruscum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its environment by controlling populations of microscopic organisms."
