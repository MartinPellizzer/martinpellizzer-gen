    "intro": "Narcissus pinto-gomesii, commonly known as the Pinto-Gomesii daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Portugal and Spain. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with a vivid yellow corona and a white or pale yellow perianth. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are typically grass-green in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
