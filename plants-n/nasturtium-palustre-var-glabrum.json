It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, as indicated by its varietal name. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wetland environments. This species is notable for its edible leaves and flowers, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
