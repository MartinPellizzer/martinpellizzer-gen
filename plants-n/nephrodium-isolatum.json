    "intro": "Nephrodium isolatum, commonly known as the solitary kidney fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, solitary fronds that emerge directly from the rhizome, lacking the typical branching structure seen in most ferns. The plant has a distinctive kidney-shaped leaf, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium isolatum is considered a conservation concern."
