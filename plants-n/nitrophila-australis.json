    "intro": "Nitrophila australis, commonly known as the Australian nitrophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich environments, often found in areas with high nitrogen content. Nitrophila australis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
