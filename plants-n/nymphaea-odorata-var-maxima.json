It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom.
