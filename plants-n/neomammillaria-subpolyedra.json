    "intro": "Neomammillaria subpolyedra, commonly known as the Desert Rose or the Purple Ghost, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often tinged with purple or pink hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is slow, and it forms a dense, compact cluster of stems. Neomammillaria subpolyedra is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
