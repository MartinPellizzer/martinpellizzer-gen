It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea kosteletzkyi plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
