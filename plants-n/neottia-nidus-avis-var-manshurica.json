    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis var. manshurica, commonly known as the Siberian owl's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northeastern China. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, slender stem that bears a single, elongated ovary. The plant produces a single, spurred flower with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles an owl's beak, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and swamps, often growing on the forest floor. The species is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers and is considered a rare and endangered orchid in its native range."
