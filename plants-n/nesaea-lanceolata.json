    "intro": "Nesaea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf nesaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, organic soils. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nesaea lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
