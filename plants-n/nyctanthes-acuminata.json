    "intro": "Nyctanthes acuminata, commonly known as night-flowering jasmine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Nyctanthes acuminata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
