It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that resemble pencils. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for succulent collections."
