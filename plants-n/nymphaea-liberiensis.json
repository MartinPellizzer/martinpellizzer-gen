    "intro": "Nymphaea liberiensis, commonly known as the Liberian water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
