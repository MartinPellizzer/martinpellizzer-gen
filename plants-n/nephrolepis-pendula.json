    "intro": "Nephrolepis pendula, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a delicate, lace-like pattern. Nephrolepis pendula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
