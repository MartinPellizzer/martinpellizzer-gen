    "intro": "Neodypsis, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their thick, swollen trunks that store water, enabling them to survive in arid environments. Neodypsis species typically have small, narrow leaves and produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are popular in horticulture for their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Neodypsis decussata and Neodypsis leiorhyncha, which are widely cultivated in warm climates."
