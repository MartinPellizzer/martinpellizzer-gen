    "intro": "Nymphaea abhayana, commonly known as the Abhayana water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it photosynthesize efficiently in aquatic environments. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
