    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia var. pectinata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a variant of the common nephrolepis fern. It is characterized by its pinnate fronds that are often curled and resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. This variant is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
