    "intro": "Neurotheca, commonly known as the \"sac of the nerves,\" is a specialized plant structure found in certain species of orchids. It is a small, sac-like organ that develops at the base of the flower stem and is involved in the secretion of nectar. This structure plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The neurotheca is often modified in shape and size depending on the species and its ecological needs. Its presence is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in the identification of specific orchid genera."
