    "intro": "Nymphaea lutea f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted yellow water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, yellow-orange floating leaves that often bear distinctive dark spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens and ecological restoration projects."
