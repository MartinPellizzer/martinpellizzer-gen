It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are orange-red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Neolitsea nicobarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
