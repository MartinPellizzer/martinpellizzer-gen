    "intro": "Neuroloma botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botswana flame lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white throat. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with clusters of vibrant blooms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of foliage. Neuroloma botschantzevii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water during its dormant period."
