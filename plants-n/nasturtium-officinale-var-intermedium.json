It features showy, edible flowers in shades of orange and red, often with a distinctive spurred petal at the base. The plant produces heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are glossy and slightly hairy. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can grow up to several meters in length. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use, particularly in salads and as a natural pest repellent in gardens."
