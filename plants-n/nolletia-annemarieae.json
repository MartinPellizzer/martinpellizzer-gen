    "intro": "Nolletia annemarieae, commonly known as the Annemarie's nolletia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are often pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Nolletia annemarieae is relatively rare and has limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
