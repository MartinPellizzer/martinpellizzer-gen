    "intro": "Nigritella nigra var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are highly ornate and resemble the shape of a skull, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
