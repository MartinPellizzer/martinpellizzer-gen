    "intro": "Nemexia hugeri, commonly known as the silverleaf nemexia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
