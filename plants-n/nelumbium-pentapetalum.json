    "intro": "Nelumbium pentapetalum, commonly known as the five-petaled water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that float on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide shade and oxygen to the water body. Its flowers typically open in the late afternoon and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Nelumbium pentapetalum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
