    "intro": "Neottia polystachya, commonly known as the clustered lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like arrangement of small white or pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Neottia polystachya is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a relatively common orchid in its native range."
