    "intro": "Nephrodium extensum var. laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
