    "intro": "Neltuma arenosa, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism known as a lichen. This plant is typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or other substrates where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its structure is flattened and crust-like, allowing it to withstand harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Neltuma arenosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its habitat."
