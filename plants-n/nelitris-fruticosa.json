    "intro": "Nelitris fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub or beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Nelitris fruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
