    "intro": "Nasturtium curvisiliquum var. lyratum, commonly known as the lyrated nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers and heart-shaped, edible leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with trailing stems that make it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels, and the leaves are often lobed with a distinctive, lyrical shape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, as both its flowers and leaves are edible."
