    "intro": "Narcissus majalis var. exertus, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. It is notable for its early flowering, often appearing when snow is still present. The variety exertus is distinguished by its slightly elongated and more upright flower stems compared to the typical form."
