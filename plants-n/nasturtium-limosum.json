    "intro": "Nasturtium limosum, commonly known as the swamp nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Nasturtium limosum is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil."
