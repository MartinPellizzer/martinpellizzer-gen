    "intro": "Nymphaea tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous water lily, is a species of water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its tuberous roots serve as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Nymphaea tuberosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms."
