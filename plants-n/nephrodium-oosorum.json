    "intro": "Nephrodium oosorum, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrolepidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium oosorum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
