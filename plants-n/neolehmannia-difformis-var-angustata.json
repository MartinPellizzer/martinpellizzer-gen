    "intro": "Neolehmannia difformis var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Lehmann's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy soils. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
