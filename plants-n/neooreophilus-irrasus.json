    "intro": "Neooreophilus irrasus, commonly known as the silver-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, typically found in cloud forests. The plant produces striking, pale purple flowers with intricate patterns that resemble lace, making it a sought-after specimen among horticulturists. Its leaves are broad and silvery, adapted to reflect excess sunlight and retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Neooreophilus irrasus is classified as an endangered species."
