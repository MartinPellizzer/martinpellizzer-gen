    "intro": "Nymphaea capensis var. zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
