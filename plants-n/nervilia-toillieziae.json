    "intro": "Nervilia toillieziae, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a rare and delicate orchid native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
