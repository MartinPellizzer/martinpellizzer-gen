    "intro": "Nervilia peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
