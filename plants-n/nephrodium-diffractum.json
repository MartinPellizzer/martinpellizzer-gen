    "intro": "Nephrodium diffractum, commonly known as the Fringed Nephrolepis, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are divided into narrow, toothed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with rhizomes that spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nephrodium diffractum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
