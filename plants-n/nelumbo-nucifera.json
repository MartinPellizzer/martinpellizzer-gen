    "intro": "Nelumbo nucifera, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, and its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in muddy substrates, while its stems rise through the water to support the foliage and flowers. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and religious ceremonies. The lotus is also notable for its ability to thrive in still water, making it a common sight in ponds and lakes."
