    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea var. normalis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often reaching up to 1 meter in diameter, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The species is also notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to water purification in its natural habitat."
