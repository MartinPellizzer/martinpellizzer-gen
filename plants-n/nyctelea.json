    "intro": "Nyctelea, commonly known as the nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are typically herbaceous and can be either annual or perennial, depending on the species. Nyctelea species are characterized by their showy, often violet or blue flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and the fruits are berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to their toxic properties, Nyctelea plants are generally avoided for consumption but are valued in ecological studies for their role in supporting nocturnal wildlife."
