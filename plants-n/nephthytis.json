    "intro": "Nephthytis, commonly known as the ZZ plant, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive, upright, dark green leaves. It is native to eastern Africa and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to store water, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowers, though rarely seen, are typically small and greenish-white, emerging from a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like spathe. Nephthytis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive with minimal care."
