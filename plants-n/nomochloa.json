    "intro": "Nomochloa, commonly known as the \"drought-tolerant grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Nomochloa species are often used in landscaping for their resilience and low maintenance requirements. Botanically, they are valued for their adaptability and ecological role in stabilizing soils in dry regions."
