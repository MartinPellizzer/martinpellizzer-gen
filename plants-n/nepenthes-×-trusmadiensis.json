    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 trusmadiensis, commonly known as the Titiwangsa hybrid, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapting to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. This hybrid is notable for its ecological significance and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and biological interest."
