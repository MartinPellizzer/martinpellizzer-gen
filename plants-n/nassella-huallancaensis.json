    "intro": "Nassella huallancaensis, commonly known as the Huallanca needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological importance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
