    "intro": "Neoregelia eleutheropetala var. bicolor, commonly known as the Bicolor Bells of Peru, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that display a bicolor pattern, often with red and yellow or orange hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, bright environment."
