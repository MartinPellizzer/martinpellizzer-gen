    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas var. khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi male fern, is a variant of the common male fern found in the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a robust and upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
