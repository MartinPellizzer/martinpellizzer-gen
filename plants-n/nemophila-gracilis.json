    "intro": "Nemophila gracilis, commonly known as the slender blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, hairless stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Nemophila gracilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
