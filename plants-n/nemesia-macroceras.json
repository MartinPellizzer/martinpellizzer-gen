    "intro": "Nemesia macroceras, commonly known as the large-fruited nemesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nemesia macroceras is valued for its early spring blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
