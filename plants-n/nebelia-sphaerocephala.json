    "intro": "Nebelia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form, which consists of a central thallus with lateral lobes. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups on the thallus surface. Nebelia sphaerocephala plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
