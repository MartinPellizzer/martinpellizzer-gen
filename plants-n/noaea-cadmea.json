    "intro": "Noaea cadmea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Noaea cadmea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a characteristic species of coastal and inland dunes."
