    "intro": "Nerium coronarium, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a succulent shrub that belongs to the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its water-storing stems and leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Despite its ornamental value, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
