    "intro": "Nymphaea nouchali var. nouchali, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The sacred lotus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries."
