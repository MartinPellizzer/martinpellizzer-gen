The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with complex, branching structures that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically composed of multiple layers of pinnae, which are arranged in a highly specialized pattern. The species is native to specific regions with humid, shaded environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Nephrodium multilineatum is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
