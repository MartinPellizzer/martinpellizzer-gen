    "intro": "Narcissus triandrus subsp. pallidulus, commonly known as the pale narcissus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring strap-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other narcissus species, and it prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens due to its elegant appearance and fragrance."
