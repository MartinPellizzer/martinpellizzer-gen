    "intro": "Nanozostera capensis, commonly known as the Cape flatworm grass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a seagrass species that thrives in shallow, sandy-bottomed waters, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Nanozostera capensis is also important for carbon sequestration and water quality maintenance in its native environment."
