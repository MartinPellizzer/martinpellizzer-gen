    "intro": "Nasturtium apetalum, commonly known as the leafy nasturtium, is a unique variant of the nasturtium genus that lacks the typical showy flowers. Instead, it produces small, inconspicuous blooms and is primarily valued for its edible, peppery-tasting leaves. This plant is native to South America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative and culinary plant, adding both visual interest and flavor to gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in horticulture and botany."
