    "intro": "Nauclea scandens, commonly known as the climbing nauclea, is a tropical shrub or vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Nauclea scandens is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
