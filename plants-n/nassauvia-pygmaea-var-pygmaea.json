It features small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant ornamental plants."
