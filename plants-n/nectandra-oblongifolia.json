    "intro": "Nectandra oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, aromatic fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is valued for its resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal preparations. Nectandra oblongifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
