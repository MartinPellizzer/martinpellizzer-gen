    "intro": "Notocactus sellowii f. centrispinus, commonly known as the Centrispinus Notocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and distinctive, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a dense covering of short, sharp spines. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the evening and closing by morning. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
