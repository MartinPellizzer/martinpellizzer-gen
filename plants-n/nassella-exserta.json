    "intro": "Nassella exserta, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, erect flowering stems that produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color and a fibrous root system. Nassella exserta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
