    "intro": "Nabalus trifoliolatus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf three-leaf holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, red berries that are an attractive feature in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for foundation plantings or as a specimen plant."
