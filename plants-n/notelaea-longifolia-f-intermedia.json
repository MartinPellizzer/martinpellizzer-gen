    "intro": "Notelaea longifolia f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate longleaf notelaea, is a botanical variant of the longleaf notelaea species. It is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish in color, and it produces small, red or orange berries. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
