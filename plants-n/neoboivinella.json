    "intro": "Neoboivinella, commonly known as the \"ghost fern,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds. Neoboivinella is noted for its slow growth and is often collected by enthusiasts due to its unique botanical features."
