    "intro": "Nitraria schoberi var. faurei, commonly known as the desert raisin tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible and have a sweet, raisin-like flavor. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
