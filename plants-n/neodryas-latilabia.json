    "intro": "Neodryas latilabia, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in clusters with each new growth arising from the base of the previous one. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Neodryas latilabia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
