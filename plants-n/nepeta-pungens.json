    "intro": "Nepeta pungens, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. Nepeta pungens is known for its strong aromatic properties, largely due to the presence of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its effects on cats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal collections."
