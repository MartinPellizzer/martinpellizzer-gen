    "intro": "Neotinea intacta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of mangroves or cypress trees. Neotinea intacta is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
