    "intro": "Noaea canescens, commonly known as the sandy sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds efficiently. Noaea canescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
