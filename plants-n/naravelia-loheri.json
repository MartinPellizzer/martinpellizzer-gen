    "intro": "Naravelia loheri, commonly known as the Loher's naravelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Naravelia loheri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
