It features broad, floating leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow to green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive, boat-shaped structure. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for aquatic gardens."
