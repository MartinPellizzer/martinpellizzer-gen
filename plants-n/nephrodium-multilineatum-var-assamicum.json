    "intro": "Nephrodium multilineatum var. assamicum, commonly known as the Assam nephroid, is a rare and specialized fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fiddle-shaped fronds that are often intricately divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the margins of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
