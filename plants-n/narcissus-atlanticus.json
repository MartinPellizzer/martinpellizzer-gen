    "intro": "Narcissus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic daffodil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the daffodil genus. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to maritime climates with salt spray. Its bulbs are typically small and produce one to three flowers per stem. Narcissus atlanticus is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to bloom early in the spring."
