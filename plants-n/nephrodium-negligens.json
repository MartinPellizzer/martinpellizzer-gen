    "intro": "Nephrodium negligens, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to submerged substrates. Nephrodium negligens plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
