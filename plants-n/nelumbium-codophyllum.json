    "intro": "Nelumbium codophyllum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing shade and oxygen to the aquatic environment. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. The sacred lotus is also notable for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies."
