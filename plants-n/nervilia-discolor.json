    "intro": "Nervilia discolor, commonly known as the pink lily or the white lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Nervilia discolor is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
