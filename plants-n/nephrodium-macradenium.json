    "intro": "Nephrodium macradenium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Its reproductive structures are typically located near the base of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
