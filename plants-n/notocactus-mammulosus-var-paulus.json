    "intro": "Notocactus mammulosus var. paulus, commonly known as the Paul's globose cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rounded, bulbous stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
