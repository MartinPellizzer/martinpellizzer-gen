    "intro": "Neotorularia humilis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved form of the species, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaf surfaces and compact growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native habitat."
