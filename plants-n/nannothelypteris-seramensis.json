    "intro": "Nannothelypteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its small, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Nannothelypteris seramensis is considered a vulnerable species."
