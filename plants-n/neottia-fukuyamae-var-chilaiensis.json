    "intro": "Neottia fukuyamae var. chilaiensis, commonly known as the Chilaiensis\u6753\u5170, is a rare orchid species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
