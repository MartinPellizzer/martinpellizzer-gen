    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus var. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's daffodil, is a rare and delicate variant of the common daffodil. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow flower with a slender, trumpet-shaped corona. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, typically between March and April. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
