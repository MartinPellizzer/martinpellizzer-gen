    "intro": "Nephrodium nebulosum, commonly known as the misty nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the moist, shaded undergrowth of tropical forests. It features intricate fronds with a unique, cloud-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
