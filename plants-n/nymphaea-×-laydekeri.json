    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 laydekeri, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, waxy, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, often with a white or pinkish center. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to repel water. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies. Nymphaea \u00d7 laydekeri is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value."
