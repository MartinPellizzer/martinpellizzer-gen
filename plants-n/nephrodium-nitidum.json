    "intro": "Nephrodium nitidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
