    "intro": "Notholaena dipinnata, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bi-pinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Notholaena dipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
