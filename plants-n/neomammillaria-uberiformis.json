    "intro": "Neomammillaria uberiformis, commonly known as the woolly nipple cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the rocky habitats of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is typically green, with a slightly ribbed texture, and it is adapted to arid environments. Neomammillaria uberiformis is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
