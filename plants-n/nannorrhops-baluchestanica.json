It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate saline soils. Its fruit, a small date-like drupe, is edible and has been used traditionally for food. Nannorrhops baluchestanica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
