    "intro": "Neomammillaria wagneriana, commonly known as Wagner's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are typically white to yellow in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
