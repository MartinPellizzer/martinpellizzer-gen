    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea f. candida, commonly known as the white water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds or lakes. The flowers emit a fragrant scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
