    "intro": "Nepenthes erucoides, commonly known as the long-tubed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's specialized leaves form pitfall traps that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to break down prey. Its habitat typically includes shaded, humid environments within the rainforest understory. Nepenthes erucoides is notable for its ability to capture and digest insects and small vertebrates, contributing to its ecological niche in nutrient-poor soils."
