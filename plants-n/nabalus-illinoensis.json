It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodland or prairie habitats. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
