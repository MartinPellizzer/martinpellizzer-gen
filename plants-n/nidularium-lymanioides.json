    "intro": "Nidularium lymanioides, commonly known as the Lyman's ground orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and possesses a network of rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted for efficient water retention in its natural habitat. Nidularium lymanioides is typically found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in the understory with partial shade."
