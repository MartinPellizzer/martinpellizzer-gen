    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupensis watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, often appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
