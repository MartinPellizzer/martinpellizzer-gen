    "intro": "Neuroloma pjataevae, commonly known as the Pjataev's neurolobed plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its intricate, neurolobed leaves that exhibit a complex pattern of lobes and ridges, which are adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale yellow petals, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and deeply anchored, allowing it to withstand strong winds and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Neuroloma pjataevae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
