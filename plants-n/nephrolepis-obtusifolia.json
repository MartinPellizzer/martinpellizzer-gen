    "intro": "Nephrolepis obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with broad, lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
