    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia var. pumicicola, commonly known as the pumice fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions."
