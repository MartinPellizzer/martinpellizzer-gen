    "intro": "Nidorella pinnatilobata, commonly known as the lace-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided leaves that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
