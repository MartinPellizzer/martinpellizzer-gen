    "intro": "Neobeguea, commonly known as the royal palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, fan-shaped leaves that give them a distinctive appearance. Neobeguea species are typically evergreen and can grow up to 20 meters in height, making them prominent features in their natural habitats. They thrive in warm, humid climates and require well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as landscape plants."
