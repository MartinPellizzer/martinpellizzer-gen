    "intro": "Nephrolepis grayumiana, commonly known as the Gray's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Nephrolepis grayumiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
