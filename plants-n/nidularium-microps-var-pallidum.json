    "intro": "Nidularium microps var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale dwarf marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish leaves and its unique inflorescence that bears clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems and its value in botanical research."
