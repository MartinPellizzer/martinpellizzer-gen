It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Narvalina is also notable for its ability to thrive in salty environments, making it a hardy species found along shorelines."
