    "intro": "Nardophyllum kingii, commonly known as the King's nard, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or alpine regions. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
