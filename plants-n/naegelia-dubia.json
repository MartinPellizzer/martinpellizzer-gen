    "intro": "Naegelia dubia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Naegelia dubia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
