    "intro": "Nectandra rigida var. pohlii, commonly known as the Pohlii Sandstone Tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and Cuba. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
