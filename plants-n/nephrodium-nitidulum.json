    "intro": "Nephrodium nitidulum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium nitidulum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
