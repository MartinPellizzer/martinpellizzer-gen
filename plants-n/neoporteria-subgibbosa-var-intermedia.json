    "intro": "Neoporteria subgibbosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate swamp cypress, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed on its branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse seeds via water. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
