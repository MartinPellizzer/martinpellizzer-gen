    "intro": "Nephrodium coniifolium, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium coniifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
