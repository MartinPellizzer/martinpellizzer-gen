    "intro": "Notholaena palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Notholaena palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
