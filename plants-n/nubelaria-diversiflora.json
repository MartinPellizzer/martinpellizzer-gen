    "intro": "Nubelaria diversiflora, commonly known as the cloudshade fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, bioluminescent fronds that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's roots are deeply embedded in the moist, shaded soil, allowing it to thrive in humid, cool environments. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters of vibrant blue and violet, are highly specialized for wind pollination. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Nubelaria diversiflora is considered an endangered species."
