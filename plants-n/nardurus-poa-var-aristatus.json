    "intro": "Nardurus poa var. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive tufted appearance at the base. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
