    "intro": "Navarretia divaricata var. vividior, commonly known as the vivid dwarf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its striking color and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
