    "intro": "Nepenthes eymae, commonly known as the Eymae's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, striking pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are modified into elongated, hollow structures that serve as both a lure and a digestive chamber. Nepenthes eymae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall and nutrient-poor soil. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in the study of plant evolution and carnivory."
