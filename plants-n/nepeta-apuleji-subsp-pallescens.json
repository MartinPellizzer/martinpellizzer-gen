    "intro": "Nepeta apuleji subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the gray catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to grayish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving the plant a distinctive, velvety appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
