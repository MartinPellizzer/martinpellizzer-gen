The plant has broad, rounded green leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, depending on the water conditions. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Nymphaea \u00d7 rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in water gardens and ponds."
