    "intro": "Neomammillaria lanata, commonly known as the woolly nipple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Neomammillaria lanata is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
