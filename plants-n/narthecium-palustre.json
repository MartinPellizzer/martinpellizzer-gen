    "intro": "Narthecium palustre, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in northern regions. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Narthecium palustre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
