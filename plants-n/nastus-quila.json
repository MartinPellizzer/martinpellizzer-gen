It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nastus quila is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
