    "intro": "Noccaea natolica, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Noccaea natolica is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
