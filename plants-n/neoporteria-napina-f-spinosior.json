    "intro": "Neoporteria napina f. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny marsh fern, is a variant of the marsh fern species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical form. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, serrated leaflets. This fern plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
