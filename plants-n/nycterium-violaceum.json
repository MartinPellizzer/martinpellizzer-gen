    "intro": "Nycterium violaceum, commonly known as the violet nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its violet-colored flowers and toxic berries. The plant contains alkaloids, which make it poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution when handling."
