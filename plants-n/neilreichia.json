    "intro": "Neilreichia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and can grow quite long. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Neilreichia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
