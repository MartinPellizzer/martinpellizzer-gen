It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
