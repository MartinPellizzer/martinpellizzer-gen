    "intro": "Neuracanthus tetragonostachyus subsp. tetragonostachyus, commonly known as the four-angled sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-angled stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
