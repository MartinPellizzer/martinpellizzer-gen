    "intro": "Nymphaea hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea hastata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
