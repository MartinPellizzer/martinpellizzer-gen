    "intro": "Neurophyllum hostmannianum, commonly known as the Hostmann's neurophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has a woody stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
