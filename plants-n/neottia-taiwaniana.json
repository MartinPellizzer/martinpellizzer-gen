    "intro": "Neottia taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellowish, bloom in early spring and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Neottia taiwaniana is valued for its ecological role and is considered a rare species within its native habitat."
