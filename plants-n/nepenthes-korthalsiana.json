    "intro": "Nepenthes korthalsiana, commonly known as the Korthals's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are usually bright red or yellow, often with a waxy coating that enhances their visual appeal and attracts prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Nepenthes korthalsiana is also notable for its ability to hybridize with other Nepenthes species, contributing to its popularity among plant enthusiasts."
