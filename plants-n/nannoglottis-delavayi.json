    "intro": "Nannoglottis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's nannoglottis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
