    "intro": "Neottia alsinifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that resemble small, ghostly shapes. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Neottia alsinifolia is notable for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its roots from the air and rain, rather than from soil."
