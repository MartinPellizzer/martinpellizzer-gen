    "intro": "Nuphar longifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that repels water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically above the water surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Nuphar longifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
