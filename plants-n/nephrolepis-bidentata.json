    "intro": "Nephrolepis bidentata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with lanceolate pinnae that are often bipinnate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
