    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. macrostelis, commonly known as the large-stalked bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are arranged in a spike and display a range of colors, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish hue. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
