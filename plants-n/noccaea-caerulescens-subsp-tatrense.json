    "intro": "Noccaea caerulescens subsp. tatrense, commonly known as the Tatran Mountain stonecress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of bluish-gray leaves and small, four-petaled white or pale blue flowers. This species thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It has a compact growth form, with leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is also known for its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals, making it an important species in phytoremediation studies."
