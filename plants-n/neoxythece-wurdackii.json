    "intro": "Neoxythece wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, and it has a stout, unbranched trunk. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
