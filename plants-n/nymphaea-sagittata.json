    "intro": "Nymphaea sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking white or pink flowers bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom and absorbing nutrients from the water. Nymphaea sagittata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
