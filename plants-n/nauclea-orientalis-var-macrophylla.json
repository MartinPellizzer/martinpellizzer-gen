It is characterized by its broad, glossy, ovate leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings for its attractive foliage and floral display."
