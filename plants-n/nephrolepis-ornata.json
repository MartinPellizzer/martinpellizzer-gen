    "intro": "Nephrolepis ornata, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a dense, lush appearance. Nephrolepis ornata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
