    "intro": "Nectandra baccans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Due to its valuable timber, it is often harvested for its dense and durable wood, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
