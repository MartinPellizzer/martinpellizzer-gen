    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina f. aconcaguensis, commonly known as the Aconcagua neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes mountains in Chile. It is characterized by its compact shrub form with dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
