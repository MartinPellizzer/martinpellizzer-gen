    "intro": "Nepenthes nebularum, commonly known as the nebular pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, strikingly colorful pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant's leaves are modified into hollow, tubular structures that serve as both a lure and a trap for unsuspecting prey. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured insects. The species is also notable for its ability to produce nectar to attract pollinators, showcasing a dual ecological strategy."
