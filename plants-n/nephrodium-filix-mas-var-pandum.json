It is characterized by its feathery, light green fronds that are often used in traditional cuisine and crafts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils that contribute to its unique fragrance and medicinal properties."
