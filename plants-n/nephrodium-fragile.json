    "intro": "Nephrodium fragile, commonly known as the fragile nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant's fronds are usually narrow and arching, with a soft, velvety texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, Nephrodium fragile is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
