    "intro": "Nephelaphyllum thaovyae, commonly known as the Cambodian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Cambodia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and sepals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing epiphytically on trees or rocky surfaces. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical researchers. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered."
