    "intro": "Narcissus quintanilhae, commonly known as the Quintanilha daffodil, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are relatively small and have a fibrous root system, which helps it survive in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
