    "intro": "Nymphaea rubra subsp. latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petalled water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy upper surface that repels water. Its showy, fragrant flowers are typically pink to red, opening in the morning and closing at midday. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
