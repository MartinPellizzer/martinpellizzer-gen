    "intro": "Nymphaea reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Nymphaea reniformis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
