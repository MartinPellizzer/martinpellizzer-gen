    "intro": "Nototrichium, commonly known as the \"cottonweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their woolly, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Nototrichium species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Their botanical features make them well adapted to drought conditions and they play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
