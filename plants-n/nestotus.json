    "intro": "Nestotus, commonly known as the mountain beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nestotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific soil and climate conditions."
