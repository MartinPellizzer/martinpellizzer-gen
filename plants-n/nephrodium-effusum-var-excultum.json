    "intro": "Nephrodium effusum var. excultum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
