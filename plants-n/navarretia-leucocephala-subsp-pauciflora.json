    "intro": "Navarretia leucocephala subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the white-flowered navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
