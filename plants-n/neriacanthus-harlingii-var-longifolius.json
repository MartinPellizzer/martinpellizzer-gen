    "intro": "Neriacanthus harlingii var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved neriacanthus, is a lesser-known species within the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
