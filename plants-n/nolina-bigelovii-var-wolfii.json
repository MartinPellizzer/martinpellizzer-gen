    "intro": "Nolina bigelovii var. wolfii, commonly known as the silverleaf nolina, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a waxy, silver-white coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, blue-gray berries. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water requirements. The silverleaf nolina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
