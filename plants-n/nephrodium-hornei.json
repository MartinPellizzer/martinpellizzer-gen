    "intro": "Nephrodium hornei, commonly known as the Horned Nephroid, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex reproductive system, producing both spores and gametes, which is typical of its fern group. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it survive in its humid, tropical environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium hornei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
