It is characterized by its distinctive striped pattern on the culms, which sets it apart from other members of the genus. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and construction due to its strong and durable structure."
