    "intro": "Neowerdermannia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neowerdermannia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
