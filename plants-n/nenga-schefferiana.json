    "intro": "Nenga schefferiana, commonly known as the Schefflera plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, opposite, and often glossy dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black berries, though it is rarely cultivated for its fruit. Nenga schefferiana is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
