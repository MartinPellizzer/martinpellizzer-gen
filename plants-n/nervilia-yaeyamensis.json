    "intro": "Nervilia yaeyamensis, commonly known as the Yaeyama nerveplant, is a rare orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate white to pale purple flowers with intricate, veined petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
