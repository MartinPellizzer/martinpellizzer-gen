    "intro": "Notopleura patria, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily pines and rimu, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on insect pollination. Notopleura patria plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's forests."
