    "intro": "Nautophylla, commonly known as the sea lantern, is a unique flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark. The plant thrives in saline environments, adapting to high salt concentrations through specialized root structures. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss in arid coastal conditions. Nautophylla plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and attracting nocturnal pollinators."
