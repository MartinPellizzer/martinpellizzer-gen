    "intro": "Neomangenotia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Neomangenotia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
