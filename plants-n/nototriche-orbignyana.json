    "intro": "Nototriche orbignyana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Nototriche orbignyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
