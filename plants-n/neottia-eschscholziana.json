    "intro": "Neottia eschscholziana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
