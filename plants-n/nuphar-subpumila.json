    "intro": "Nuphar subpumila, commonly known as the small spatterdock, is a species of water lily native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically with 5-7 petals. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in aquatic environments. Nuphar subpumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
