    "intro": "Nauclea pilulifera, commonly known as the pill tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, pill-like fruits that are a distinctive feature of the species. Nauclea pilulifera is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or disturbed areas. Its unique fruit morphology and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both ecological and pharmacological studies."
