    "intro": "Nepeta vivianii, commonly known as the Alpine catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic, often emitting a minty scent when crushed. Nepeta vivianii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
