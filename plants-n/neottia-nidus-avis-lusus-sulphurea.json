    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis lusus sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur tailed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking yellowish-green inflorescences that resemble a bird's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
