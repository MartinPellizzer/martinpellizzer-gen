The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Nuttallia involucrata plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
