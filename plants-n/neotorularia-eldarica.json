    "intro": "Neotorularia eldarica, commonly known as the Eldarica Sporebloom, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Eldarica region. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent spore capsules that emit a soft glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires a specific mix of fungal mycelium to support its growth. Its leaves are broad and slightly translucent, allowing light to pass through and nourish the symbiotic algae within. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, Neotorularia eldarica is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
