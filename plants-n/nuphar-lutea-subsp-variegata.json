    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. variegata, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with white or yellow veins, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The subspecies variegata is distinguished by its distinctive leaf patterns and flower coloration."
