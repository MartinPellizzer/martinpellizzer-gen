    "intro": "Nardosmia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan musk orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that emit a subtle musk-like scent. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nardosmia himalaica is considered a rare and endangered species."
