    "intro": "Neurolaena integrifolia, commonly known as broadleaf morning glory, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
