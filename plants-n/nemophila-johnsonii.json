    "intro": "Nemophila johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal prairies and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
