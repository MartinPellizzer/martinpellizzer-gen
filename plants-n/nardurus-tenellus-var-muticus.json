    "intro": "Nardurus tenellus var. muticus, commonly known as the silent nardus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, fibrous foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the substrate. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
