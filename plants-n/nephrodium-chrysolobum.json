    "intro": "Nephrodium chrysolobum, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. The golden kidney fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
