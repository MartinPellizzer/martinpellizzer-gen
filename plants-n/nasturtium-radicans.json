    "intro": "Nasturtium radicans, commonly known as creeping nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, edible flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over other plants. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and edible plants. The leaves and flowers are often used in culinary applications, adding a peppery flavor to salads and dishes."
