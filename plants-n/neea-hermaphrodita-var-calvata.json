    "intro": "Neea hermaphrodita var. calvata, commonly known as the smoothleaf neea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are hermaphroditic, meaning each flower contains both male and female parts. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
