    "intro": "Nephrolepis arida, commonly known as the desert fern, is a species of fern native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Nephrolepis arida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
