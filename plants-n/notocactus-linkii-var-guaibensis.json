    "intro": "Notocactus linkii var. guaibensis, commonly known as the Guaibense cactus, is a species native to Brazil, specifically the state of Par\u00e1. It is a columnar cactus with a straight, unbranched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
