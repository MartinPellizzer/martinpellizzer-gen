    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. oocarpa, commonly known as the white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often with a yellow center. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and support aquatic ecosystems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and beetles."
