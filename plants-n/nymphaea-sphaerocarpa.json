It is characterized by its floating, rounded leaves that form a dense, circular canopy on the water surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving waters. Nymphaea sphaerocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
