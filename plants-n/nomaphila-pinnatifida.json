    "intro": "Nomaphila pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately divided leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive orchid-like appearance. Nomaphila pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
