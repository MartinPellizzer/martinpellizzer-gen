    "intro": "Neottia confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that lack petals, giving it a ghostly appearance. Neottia confusa is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
