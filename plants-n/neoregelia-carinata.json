    "intro": "Neoregelia carinata, commonly known as the \"Crimson Sword\" or \"Red Neoregelia,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant red and green foliage, with the central rosette of leaves forming a cup that collects water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Neoregelia carinata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
