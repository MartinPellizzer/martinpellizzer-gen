    "intro": "Nama coulteri var. coulteri, commonly known as the Coulter's name, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by hard, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
