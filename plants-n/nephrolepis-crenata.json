    "intro": "Nephrolepis crenata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense clumps over time. Nephrolepis crenata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
