    "intro": "Neomammillaria guerreronis, commonly known as the Guerrero nipple cactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts."
