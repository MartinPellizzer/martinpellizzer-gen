    "intro": "Neomammillaria densispina, commonly known as the dense spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are typically short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Neomammillaria densispina is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
