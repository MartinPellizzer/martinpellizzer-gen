    "intro": "Neuroloma stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
