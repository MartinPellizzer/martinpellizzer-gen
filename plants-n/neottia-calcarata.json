    "intro": "Neottia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant grows in calcareous soils, often on rocky or limestone substrates, and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Neottia calcarata is a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
