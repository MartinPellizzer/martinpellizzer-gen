    "intro": "Nephrolepis tuberosa var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sword fern, is a varietal form of the sword fern genus Nephrolepis. It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that give it a cascading appearance, making it ideal for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the underside of its compound leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in indoor and outdoor settings."
