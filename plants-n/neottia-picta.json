    "intro": "Neottia picta, commonly known as the pictured helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive pattern of purple and green markings. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Neottia picta is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
