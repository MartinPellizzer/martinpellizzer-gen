    "intro": "Nephrodium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak holly fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rough, serrated edge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its fronds. Nephrodium sarawakense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small organisms."
