    "intro": "Nepenthes mirabilis var. echinostoma, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are often covered in fine, spiny structures. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its unique morphological features and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
