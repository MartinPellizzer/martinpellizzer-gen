    "intro": "Nephrodium pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Nephrodium pilosulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
