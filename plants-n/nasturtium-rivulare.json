    "intro": "Nasturtium rivulare, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its edible, peppery leaves and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streams and rivers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a valuable crop and an invasive species in some regions. Nasturtium rivulare is often used in salads and herbal remedies due to its nutritional and medicinal properties."
