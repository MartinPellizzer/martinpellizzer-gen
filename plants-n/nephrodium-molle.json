    "intro": "Nephrodium molle, commonly known as the soft kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Nephrodium molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
