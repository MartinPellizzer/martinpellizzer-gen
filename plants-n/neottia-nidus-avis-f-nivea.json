    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered mosquito orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals and sepals, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of mosquitoes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
