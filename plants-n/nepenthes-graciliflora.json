    "intro": "Nepenthes graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its unique trapping mechanism involves a slippery waxy surface and a pool of digestive fluid at the base of the pitcher. Nepenthes graciliflora is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
