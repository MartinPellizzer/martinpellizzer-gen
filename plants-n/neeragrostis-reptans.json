    "intro": "Neeragrostis reptans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
