    "intro": "Nardus incurva, commonly known as the bent rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Nardus incurva thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
