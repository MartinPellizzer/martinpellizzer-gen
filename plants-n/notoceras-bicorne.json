    "intro": "Notoceras bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with two prominent, elongated petals that resemble horns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine substrates, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a striking display of violet or purple hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notoceras bicorne is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical rarity."
