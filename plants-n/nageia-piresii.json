    "intro": "Nageia piresii, commonly known as the Pires' nageia, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
