    "intro": "Nephrodium squamigerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, scaly appearance. It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the family Porellaceae, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a central stem with closely packed, overlapping leaves that give it a velvety texture. Nephrodium squamigerum is often found in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying bryophyte adaptations to specific ecological niches."
