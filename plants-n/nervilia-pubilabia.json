    "intro": "Nervilia pubilabia, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into numerous segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Nervilia pubilabia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
