    "intro": "Nephrodium gibbosum, commonly known as the globular fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, rounded fronds. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a compact, globular appearance, which gives it its common name. Nephrodium gibbosum is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth."
