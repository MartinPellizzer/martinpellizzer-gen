    "intro": "Neolloydia erectocentra, commonly known as the upright-centred neolloydia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged spirally along its stem. It typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to moist, shaded environments in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
