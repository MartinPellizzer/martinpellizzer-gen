    "intro": "Nephrodium kunthii, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of golden to brownish spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, almost palmate appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
