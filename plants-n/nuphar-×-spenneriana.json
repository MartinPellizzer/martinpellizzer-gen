    "intro": "Nuphar \u00d7 spenneriana, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both Nuphar luteum and Nuphar variegatum. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a greenish-yellow center, and they bloom in late summer. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
