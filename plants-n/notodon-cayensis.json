    "intro": "Notodon cayensis, commonly known as the Cayenne orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant color palette, including shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Notodon cayensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
