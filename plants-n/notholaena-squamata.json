    "intro": "Notholaena squamata, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena squamata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
