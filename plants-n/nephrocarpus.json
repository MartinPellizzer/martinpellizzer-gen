    "intro": "Nephrocarpus, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Nephrocarpaceae. It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Nephrocarpus species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers and fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind or water."
