    "intro": "Nephrodium luridum, commonly known as the lurid nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It possesses intricate fronds that exhibit a striking contrast of dark green and reddish hues, particularly during its flowering period. The plant's reproductive structures, including its spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium luridum is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
