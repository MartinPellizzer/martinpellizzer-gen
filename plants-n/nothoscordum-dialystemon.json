It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with strap-like, grassy foliage. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive periods of drought.
