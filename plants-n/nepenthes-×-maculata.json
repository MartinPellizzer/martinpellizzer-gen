It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful pitchers that are often adorned with red or orange markings. These specialized structures secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Nepenthes \u00d7 maculata is popular among plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
