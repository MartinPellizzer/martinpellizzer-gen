    "intro": "Neotorularia brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited torularia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and prefers well-drained soils. Its fruit is a small capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
