    "intro": "Neurola arkanzica, commonly known as the Arkansas neurola, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. Due to habitat loss, Neurola arkanzica is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
