    "intro": "Nerine angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf nerine, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant blooms in late summer to early autumn, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
