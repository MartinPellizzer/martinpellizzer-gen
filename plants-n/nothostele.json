    "intro": "Nothostele, commonly known as the \"false starwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The leaves are usually alternate, pinnately lobed, and have a fern-like appearance. Nothostele species are often found in moist, temperate regions and are sometimes used in herbal medicine. The plant's botanical features make it distinct from true starworts, which belong to a different genus."
