    "intro": "Nephrodium anateinophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, finger-like segments. The plant's leaves are typically bright green and have a distinctive, kidney-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
