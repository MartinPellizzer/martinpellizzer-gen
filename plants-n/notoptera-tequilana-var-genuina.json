It is native to the agave plants, particularly Agave tequilana, which is used in the production of tequila. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated body and distinctive coloration, often featuring a metallic green or blue hue. It plays a role in the ecological interactions of agave ecosystems, contributing to seed dispersal and nutrient cycling. Due to its association with agave, it is of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies."
