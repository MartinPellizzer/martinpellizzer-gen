    "intro": "Nageia mannii var. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara nageia, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its coniferous appearance with needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. It produces distinctive cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
