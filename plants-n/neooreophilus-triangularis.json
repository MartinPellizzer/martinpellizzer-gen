It is characterized by its unique triangular-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid's botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
