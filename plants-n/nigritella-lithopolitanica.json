    "intro": "Nigritella lithopolitanica, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to survive in arid and nutrient-poor conditions, often found on bare rock surfaces. Its structure is compact, with a dense thallus that helps retain moisture and protect against extreme temperatures. Nigritella lithopolitanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitat."
