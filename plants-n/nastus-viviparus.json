    "intro": "Nastus viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive feature, where the fruit develops into a small, leaf-like structure that can produce new plants without seeds. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress. Nastus viviparus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in herbal medicine."
