    "intro": "Nephrodium gracilescens var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular nephrodium, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, glandular structures on its leaves, which may play a role in water retention or defense mechanisms. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the dappled light. The fronds are often a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps protect against excessive moisture loss. This variant is notable for its ecological significance in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
