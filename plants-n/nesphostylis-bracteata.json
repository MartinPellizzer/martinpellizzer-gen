    "intro": "Nesphostylis bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate nesphostylis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth or slightly wavy margin. Nesphostylis bracteata is often found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
