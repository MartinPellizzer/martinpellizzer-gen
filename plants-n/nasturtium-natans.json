    "intro": "Nasturtium natans, commonly known as watercress, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on slender stalks above the water surface. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in water and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Nasturtium natans is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams."
