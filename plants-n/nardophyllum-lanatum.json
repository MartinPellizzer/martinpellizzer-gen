    "intro": "Nardophyllum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly nard plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by seed pods that mature in the fall. Nardophyllum lanatum is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
