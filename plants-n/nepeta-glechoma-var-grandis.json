It features slender, upright stems covered in opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and attractive flowers make it both ornamental and beneficial to pollinators."
