    "intro": "Nephrodium diversifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nephroid, is a unique fern species characterized by its diverse leaf morphology. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost kidney-shaped structure that gives it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its leaves are usually large, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Nephrodium diversifolium is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
