It features large, showy white petals that open in the early morning and close at dusk. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as beetles and bees. Nymphaea aegyptiaca plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
