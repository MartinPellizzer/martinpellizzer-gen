    "intro": "Nepeta juncea, commonly known as catnip, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant contains high concentrations of nepetalactone, a volatile oil responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often growing in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Nepeta juncea is widely cultivated for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
