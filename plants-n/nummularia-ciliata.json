    "intro": "Nummularia ciliata, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial that forms a dense, mat-like foliage. It features small, rounded, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in gardens or as a filler in rock gardens. The plant is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
