    "intro": "Nephrodium praetervisum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a short, stubby rhizome and intricate, bipinnate leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, making it challenging to study in the wild. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium praetervisum is considered a conservation concern."
