    "intro": "Neomammillaria albilanata, commonly known as the white-lanate mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered with white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
