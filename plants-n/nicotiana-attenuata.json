    "intro": "Nicotiana attenuata, commonly known as the wild tobacco plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap containing nicotine, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ecological importance includes serving as a host plant for certain insect species and contributing to pollinator biodiversity."
