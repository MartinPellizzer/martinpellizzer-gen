    "intro": "Notholirion bulbuliferum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are typically narrow and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces showy blooms during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Notholirion bulbuliferum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
