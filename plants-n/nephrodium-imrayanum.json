    "intro": "Nephrodium imrayanum, commonly known as the Malayan kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
