    "intro": "Noterophila bivalvis, commonly known as the bivalved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dune ecosystems. Noterophila bivalvis is typically found in well-drained, saline soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
