    "intro": "Neottia puberula, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, photosynthetic structures called leaf-like sheaths. Neottia puberula produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This species is found across much of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
