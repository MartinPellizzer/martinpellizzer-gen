    "intro": "Notholaena mollis, commonly known as the soft hair-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, leathery fronds with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are borne on the undersides of its leaves, which are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Notholaena mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical conditions."
