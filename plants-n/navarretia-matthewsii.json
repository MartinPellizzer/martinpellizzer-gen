It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and silver-colored leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
