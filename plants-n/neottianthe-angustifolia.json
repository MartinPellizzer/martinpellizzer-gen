    "intro": "Neottianthe angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neottianthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Neottianthe angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
