    "intro": "Notocactus sellowii f. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fleshed notocactus, is a unique variant of the Notocactus genus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is usually sparse, with spines that provide protection against herbivores. This cultivar is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
