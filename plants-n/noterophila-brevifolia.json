    "intro": "Noterophila brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Noterophila brevifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
