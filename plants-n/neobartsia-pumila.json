    "intro": "Neobartsia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Neobartsia pumila is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
