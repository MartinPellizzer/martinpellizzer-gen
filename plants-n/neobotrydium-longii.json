    "intro": "Neobotrydium longii, commonly known as the longii fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neobotrydium longii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
