    "intro": "Neomammillaria vaupelii var. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a ribbed structure. It features prominent, yellow spines that distinguish it from other varieties of Neomammillaria. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
