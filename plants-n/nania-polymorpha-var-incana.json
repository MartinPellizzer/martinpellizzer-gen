    "intro": "Nania polymorpha var. incana, commonly known as the hairy nania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a grayish-green color, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, pale blue or white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wet meadows."
