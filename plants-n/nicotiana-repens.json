    "intro": "Nicotiana repens, commonly known as the running nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor. Nicotiana repens contains nicotine and is related to other tobacco species, making it a subject of both botanical and agricultural interest."
