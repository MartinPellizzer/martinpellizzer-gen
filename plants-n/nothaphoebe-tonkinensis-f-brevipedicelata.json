    "intro": "Nothaphoebe tonkinensis f. brevipedicelata, commonly known as the short-stalked tonkin nothaphoebe, is a rare botanical variant of the tonkin nothaphoebe. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This form exhibits shorter pedicels compared to the typical species, giving it a more clustered appearance. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits."
