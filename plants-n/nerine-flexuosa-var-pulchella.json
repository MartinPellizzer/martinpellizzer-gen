    "intro": "Nerine flexuosa var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink nerine, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to purple, often with a white base, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that emerges in spring and dies back in winter. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
