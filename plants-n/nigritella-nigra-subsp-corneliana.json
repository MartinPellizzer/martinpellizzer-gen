    "intro": "Nigritella nigra subsp. corneliana, commonly known as the Cornelian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in woodland or open slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
