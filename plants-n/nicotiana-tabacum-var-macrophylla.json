    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. macrophylla, commonly known as the showy tobacco plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the velvety, dark purple calyx. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage is broad and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
