    "intro": "Nepeta laxiflora, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and as a nectar source for pollinators. Nepeta laxiflora is also valued for its mild mint-like scent and historical use in herbal remedies."
