    "intro": "Navipomoea involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that ripens to a bright orange or red color. Navipomoea involucrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
