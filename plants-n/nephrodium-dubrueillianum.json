    "intro": "Nephrodium dubrueillianum, commonly known as the Dubrueilla's nephroid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Nephroidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the spring months. It is native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium dubrueillianum is considered a conservation concern."
