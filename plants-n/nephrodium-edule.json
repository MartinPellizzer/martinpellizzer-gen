    "intro": "Nephrodium edule, commonly known as the edible kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators. Nephrodium edule is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its edible spores and young fronds, which are used in traditional cuisines."
