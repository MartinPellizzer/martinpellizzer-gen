    "intro": "Narcissus poeticus var. poetarum, commonly known as the Poet's Daffodil, is a rare and elegant variety of daffodil native to the Mediterranean region. It features a single, striking yellow bloom with a narrow, trumpet-shaped corona, which is slightly darker than the outer petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 40 centimeters, with strap-like, grassy foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in early spring. This variety is valued for its historical association with poetry and its delicate, refined appearance."
