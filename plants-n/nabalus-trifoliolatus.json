    "intro": "Nabalus trifoliolatus, commonly known as the three-leafed holly or trifoliate holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy evergreen leaves, which are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by red or orange berries. Nabalus trifoliolatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
