    "intro": "Neoblakea ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian neoblakea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes gourds, squash, and cucumbers. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with tendrils that help it climb and spread across vegetation. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, while the flowers are yellow and predominantly male, with separate female flowers occurring in clusters. Neoblakea ecuadorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
