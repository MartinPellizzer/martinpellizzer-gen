    "intro": "Notholaena californica f. accessita, commonly known as the San Diego rock cress, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in southern California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
