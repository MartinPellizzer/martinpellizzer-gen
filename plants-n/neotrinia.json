    "intro": "Neotrinia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Neotrinia species typically have palmate leaves and produce capsules as their fruit type. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
