    "intro": "Nertera alsinoides, commonly known as the inch plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nertera alsinoides is popular as a hanging plant due to its ability to cascade gracefully from containers."
