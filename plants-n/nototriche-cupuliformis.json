It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structure formed by its leaf bases, which enclose the flower cluster. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the central flower cluster. Nototriche cupuliformis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments, showcasing its resilience to arid conditions."
