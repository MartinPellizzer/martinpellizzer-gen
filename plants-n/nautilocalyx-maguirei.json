    "intro": "Nautilocalyx maguirei, commonly known as the giant sea hibiscus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with five broad, waxy petals. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
