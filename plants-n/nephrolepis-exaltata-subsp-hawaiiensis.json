It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its unique appearance and restricted distribution make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in Hawaii."
