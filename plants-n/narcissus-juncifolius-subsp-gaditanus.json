It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower with a yellow perianth. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, showcasing its adaptation to arid environments. It blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
