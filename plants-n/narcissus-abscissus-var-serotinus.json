    "intro": "Narcissus abscissus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower that blooms later in the season compared to other daffodil varieties. The flower typically has a yellow corona and a white or yellow perianth, adding a striking visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its resilience and ability to naturalize over time."
