It features small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
