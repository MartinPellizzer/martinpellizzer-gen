    "intro": "Neomammillaria inae, commonly known as the Inae's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Neomammillaria inae is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to succulent collections."
