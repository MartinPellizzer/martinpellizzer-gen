    "intro": "Neottia karoana, commonly known as the Karoana twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single, narrow leaf and a single, showy white or greenish-white flower. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Neottia karoana is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
