    "intro": "Nicotiana pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited flower production, it is less common in cultivation compared to other Nicotiana species."
