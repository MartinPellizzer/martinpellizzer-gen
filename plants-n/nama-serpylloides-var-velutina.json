    "intro": "Nama serpylloides var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
