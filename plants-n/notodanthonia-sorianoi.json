It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
