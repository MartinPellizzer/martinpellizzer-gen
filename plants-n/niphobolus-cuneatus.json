    "intro": "Niphobolus cuneatus, commonly known as the slender leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or green, with distinctive spurred petals. Niphobolus cuneatus is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
