    "intro": "Neolehmannia porpax, commonly known as the Porpax leafcup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neolehmannia porpax is considered a species of conservation concern."
