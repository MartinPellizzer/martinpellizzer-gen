    "intro": "Neomirandea pedrazorum, commonly known as the Pedrazo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that sets it apart from other orchid genera. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Neomirandea pedrazorum is considered a vulnerable species."
