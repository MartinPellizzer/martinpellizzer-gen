It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
