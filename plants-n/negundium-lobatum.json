    "intro": "Negundium lobatum, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and dark, with a distinctive flaky texture. Negundium lobatum is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and dry soils, and it has historical uses in dyeing and tanning."
