    "intro": "Nepenthes micramphora, commonly known as the small-leaf pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its small, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting insects. Its pitchers secrete a sticky fluid to trap prey, which is then digested by enzymes. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
