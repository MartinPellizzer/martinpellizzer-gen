    "intro": "Nuttallia procera, commonly known as the tall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, velvety surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary nutrients through photosynthesis. Nuttallia procera is often found on trees and rocks in temperate forests. Its structure consists of a complex network of fungal hyphae that support the algal cells."
