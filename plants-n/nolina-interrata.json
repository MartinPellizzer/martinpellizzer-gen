    "intro": "Nolina interrata, commonly known as the silver grass tree, is a shrub-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of stiff, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically followed by red or orange berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Nolina interrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
