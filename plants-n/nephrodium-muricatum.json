    "intro": "Nephrodium muricatum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, where it can float or grow submerged. Its leaves are typically thin and delicate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The botanical features of Nephrodium muricatum make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and carnivory in aquatic ecosystems."
