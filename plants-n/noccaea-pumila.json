    "intro": "Noccaea pumila, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Noccaea pumila is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
