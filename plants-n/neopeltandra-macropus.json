It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Neopeltandra macropus is often found in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native habitats."
