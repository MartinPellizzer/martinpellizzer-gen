    "intro": "Nephrolepis davallioides var. furcans, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive fronds. It features delicate, slender fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint glow due to the presence of certain pigments. This unique trait makes it a rare and visually striking addition to botanical collections."
