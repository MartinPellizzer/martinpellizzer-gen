    "intro": "Nephrodium everettii, commonly known as the Everett's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium everettii is considered a conservation concern."
