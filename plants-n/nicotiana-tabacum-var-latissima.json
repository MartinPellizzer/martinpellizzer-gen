    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved tobacco, is a variant of the tobacco plant characterized by its large, broad leaves. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is native to the Americas and is cultivated for its foliage rather than its seeds. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and unique texture. This variety is also valued for its historical significance in the production of tobacco products."
