    "intro": "Nyctocalos thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically open at night, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Nyctocalos thomsonii is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
