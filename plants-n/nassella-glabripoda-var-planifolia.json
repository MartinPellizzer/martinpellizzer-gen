    "intro": "Nassella glabripoda var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
