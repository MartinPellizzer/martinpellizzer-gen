    "intro": "Neooreophilus villosus, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a common trait among ferns. Due to its specialized habitat, Neooreophilus villosus is often rare and requires specific ecological conditions to flourish."
