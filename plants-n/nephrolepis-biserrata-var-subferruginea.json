    "intro": "Nephrolepis biserrata var. subferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often rust-colored fronds. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically arching, with a leathery texture and a deep green color that may develop a reddish or rust-colored hue along the margins. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
