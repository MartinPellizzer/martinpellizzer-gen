    "intro": "Nepeta camphorata var. camphorata, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Its essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, are responsible for its characteristic effect on cats and its use in traditional medicine."
