    "intro": "Nervilia diantha, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Nervilia diantha is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
