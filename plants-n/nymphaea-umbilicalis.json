    "intro": "Nymphaea umbilicalis, commonly known as the umbilical water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its leaves and flowers float on the surface. Nymphaea umbilicalis plays a role in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributes to water quality through its natural filtration processes."
