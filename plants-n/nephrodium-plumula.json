    "intro": "Nephrodium plumula, commonly known as the small kidney fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, orbicular fronds that resemble small kidneys, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Nephrodium plumula is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
