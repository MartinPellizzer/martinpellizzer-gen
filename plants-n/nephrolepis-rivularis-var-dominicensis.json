It features elegant, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like growth. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
