    "intro": "Nymphaea odorata var. rosacea, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-living plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close in the heat of the day. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. Its roots are submerged in the mud, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The pink lotus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often cultivated in ponds and gardens."
