    "intro": "Nymphoides forbesiana, commonly known as the white water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface. The plant produces showy white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning and close in the afternoon. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through water bodies. Nymphoides forbesiana is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes."
