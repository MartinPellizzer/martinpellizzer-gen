    "intro": "Neoevansia diguetii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Neoevansia diguetii is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
