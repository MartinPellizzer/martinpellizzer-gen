    "intro": "Neltuma kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's neltuma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Neltuma kuntzei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
