    "intro": "Nymphoides microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically smooth and waxy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in still freshwater habitats. Nymphoides microphylla is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
