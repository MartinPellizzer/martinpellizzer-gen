    "intro": "Nepeta annua, commonly known as catnip, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its characteristic stimulating effect on cats. Nepeta annua thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable plant in various garden settings."
