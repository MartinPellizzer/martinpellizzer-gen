    "intro": "Neomammillaria euthele, commonly known as the Euthele Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Neomammillaria euthele is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
