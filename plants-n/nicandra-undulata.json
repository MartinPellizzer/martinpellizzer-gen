    "intro": "Nicandra undulata, commonly known as the wavy nicandra, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Mexico and Central America. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Nicandra undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique floral display."
