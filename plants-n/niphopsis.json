    "intro": "Niphopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and small, often clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Niphopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as ornamental plants due to their unique foliage."
