    "intro": "Nepenthes wardii, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture prey. The plant produces a sweet-smelling nectar to lure insects into its hollow structures. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating that prevents prey from escaping. Nepenthes wardii is notable for its ability to thrive in high humidity and nutrient-poor environments."
