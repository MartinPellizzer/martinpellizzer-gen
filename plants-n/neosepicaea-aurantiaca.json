It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers, which are arranged in pendulous clusters resembling small bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Neosepicaea aurantiaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
