    "intro": "Nengella pleurocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and hickories, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. Its botanical features include a dense, compact growth habit and the ability to photosynthesize, though it relies on its host for water and nutrients. Nengella pleurocarpa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
