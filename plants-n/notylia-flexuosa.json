    "intro": "Notylia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible notylia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems that can twist and flex in response to environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, often with a slight aromatic scent. Notylia flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks."
