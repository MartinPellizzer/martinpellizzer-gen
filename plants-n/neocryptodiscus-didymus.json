It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a double leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. Neocryptodiscus didymus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and delicate floral display."
