    "intro": "Nassella johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
