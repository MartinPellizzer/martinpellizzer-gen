It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Najas tenera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
