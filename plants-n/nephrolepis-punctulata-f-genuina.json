    "intro": "Nephrolepis punctulata f. genuina, commonly known as the spotted maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with small, dark brown spots. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
