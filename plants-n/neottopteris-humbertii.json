    "intro": "Neottopteris humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, well-drained soils within forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
