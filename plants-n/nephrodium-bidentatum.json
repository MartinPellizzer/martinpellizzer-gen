    "intro": "Nephrodium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
