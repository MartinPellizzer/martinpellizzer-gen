    "intro": "Nephrolepis acuta var. laurifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, with a smooth, glossy texture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings."
