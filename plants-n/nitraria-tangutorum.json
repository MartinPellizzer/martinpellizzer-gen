The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. It plays a role in desert ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine. Nitraria tangutorum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
