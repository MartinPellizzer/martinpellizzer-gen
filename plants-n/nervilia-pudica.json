    "intro": "Nervilia pudica, commonly known as the shy plant or the blushing orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fleshy leaves and its striking, violet or purple flowers that open in response to light and warmth. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers have a distinctive structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Nervilia pudica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is noted for its sensitive, almost responsive behavior to environmental stimuli."
