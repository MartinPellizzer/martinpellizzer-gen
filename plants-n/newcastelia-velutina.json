    "intro": "Newcastelia velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. The plant has a rosette growth habit, with leaves that are dense and covered in fine hairs, giving it a tactile, fuzzy texture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
