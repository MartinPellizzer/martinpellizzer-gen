    "intro": "Nephrodium mannii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation. Nephrodium mannii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
