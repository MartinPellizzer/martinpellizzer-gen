    "intro": "Nageia putranjiva, commonly known as the sacred cycad of the Andaman Islands, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its cultural significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
