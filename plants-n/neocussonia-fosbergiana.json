    "intro": "Neocussonia fosbergiana, commonly known as the Fosberg's neocussonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
