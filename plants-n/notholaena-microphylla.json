    "intro": "Notholaena microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf chainfern, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Notholaena microphylla is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its habitat."
