    "intro": "Neomortonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and striking white or pale green flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure. Neomortonia is typically found in specific, moist, shaded environments, often in association with specific host trees. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on symbiotic relationships with fungi for survival. Due to its ecological specificity and habitat threats, Neomortonia is considered a vulnerable species."
