    "intro": "Nidularium citrinum, commonly known as the yellow basket plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Nidularium citrinum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique foliage structure."
