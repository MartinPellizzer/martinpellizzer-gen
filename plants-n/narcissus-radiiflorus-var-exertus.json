    "intro": "Narcissus radiiflorus var. exertus, commonly known as the radiated daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive radiating pattern of petals that resemble a sunburst. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in Mediterranean climates. It produces a single, upright stem with a cluster of bright yellow blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
