It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea fenzliana plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
