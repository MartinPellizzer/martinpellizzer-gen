    "intro": "Nothoscordum subbiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures that resemble garlic, though they are not true bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native or drought-tolerant plants."
