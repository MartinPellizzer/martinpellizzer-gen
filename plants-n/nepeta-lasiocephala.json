It features upright stems covered in dense, soft grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is aromatic, often emitting a mint-like scent when crushed. Nepeta lasiocephala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
