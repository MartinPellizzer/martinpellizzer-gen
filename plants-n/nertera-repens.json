It features small, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight blue or purple tinge. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Nertera repens is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ease of care."
