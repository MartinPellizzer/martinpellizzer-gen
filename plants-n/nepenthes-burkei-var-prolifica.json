    "intro": "Nepenthes burkei var. prolifica, commonly known as the Burkill's pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are often green or red in color, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and consistent moisture. This variant is notable for its prolific production of pitchers, making it a popular subject in botanical studies."
