    "intro": "Nephrodium basiattenuatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, and elliptical fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a unique, clustered pattern. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
