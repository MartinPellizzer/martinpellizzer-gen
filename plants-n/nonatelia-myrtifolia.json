    "intro": "Nonatelia myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf nonatelia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Nonatelia myrtifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
