    "intro": "Nania obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf nania, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Nania obovata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
