    "intro": "Nycterium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or purple in color. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Nycterium pubescens is native to parts of Africa and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats."
