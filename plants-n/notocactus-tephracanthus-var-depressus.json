    "intro": "Notocactus tephracanthus var. depressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that often form a dense, rounded clump. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in cactus gardens."
