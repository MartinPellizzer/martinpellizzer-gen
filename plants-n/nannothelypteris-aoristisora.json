    "intro": "Nannothelypteris aoristisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
