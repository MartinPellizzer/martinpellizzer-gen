    "intro": "Nesogenes glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. The plant is distinguished by its glandular leaves, which produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The sticky leaves serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in water retention."
