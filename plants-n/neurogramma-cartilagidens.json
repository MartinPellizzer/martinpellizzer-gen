    "intro": "Neurogramma cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, cartilage-like texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Neurogramma cartilagidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
