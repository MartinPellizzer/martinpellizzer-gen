    "intro": "Notocactus acuatus var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited hedge cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to South America. It features cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, white, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and educational purposes."
