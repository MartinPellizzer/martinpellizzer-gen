It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical landscapes."
