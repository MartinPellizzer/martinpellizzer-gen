    "intro": "Neoporteria islayensis f. molendensis, commonly known as the Islay neoporteria, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Isle of Islay in Scotland. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is notable for its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species within its native range."
