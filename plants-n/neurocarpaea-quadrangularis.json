    "intro": "Neurocarpaea quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angled neurocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
