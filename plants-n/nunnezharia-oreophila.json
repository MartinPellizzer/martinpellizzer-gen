    "intro": "Nunnezharia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its growth is closely tied to specific microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nunnezharia oreophila is considered an endangered species."
