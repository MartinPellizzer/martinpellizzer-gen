    "intro": "Navarretia fallax, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Navarretia fallax thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is valued for its early blooming period and its role in supporting pollinators."
