    "intro": "Notodanthonia tenuior, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to grazing. Notodanthonia tenuior plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
