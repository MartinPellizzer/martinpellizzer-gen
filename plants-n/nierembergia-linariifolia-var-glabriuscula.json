It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, silky hair, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or grow in ground covers."
