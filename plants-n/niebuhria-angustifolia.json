    "intro": "Niebuhria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf niebuhria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
