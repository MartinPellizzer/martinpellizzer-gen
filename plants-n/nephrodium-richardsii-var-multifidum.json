    "intro": "Nephrodium richardsii var. multifidum, commonly known as the multifidum variety of the genus Nephrodium, is a fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that often exhibit a complex, feathery structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
