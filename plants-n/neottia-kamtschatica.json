It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Neottia kamtschatica is native to the temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and Japan."
