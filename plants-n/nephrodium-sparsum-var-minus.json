    "intro": "Nephrodium sparsum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
