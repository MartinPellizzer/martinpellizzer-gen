    "intro": "Niphaea rubra, commonly known as the red water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and striking red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its stems support the buoyant leaves. Niphaea rubra plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
