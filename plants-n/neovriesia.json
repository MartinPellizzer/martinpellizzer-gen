It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Neovriesia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
