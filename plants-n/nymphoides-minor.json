    "intro": "Nymphoides minor, commonly known as the lesser water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and bloom in late summer. Nymphoides minor is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats on the water surface."
