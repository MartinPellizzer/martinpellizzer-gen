    "intro": "Niphidium americanum, commonly known as the American niphidium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Niphidium americanum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
