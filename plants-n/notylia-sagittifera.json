    "intro": "Notylia sagittifera, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Notylia sagittifera is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
