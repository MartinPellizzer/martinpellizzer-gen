    "intro": "Narcissus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces bright yellow flowers with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm, making it one of the smallest daffodil species. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Narcissus pumilus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
