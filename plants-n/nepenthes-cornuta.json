    "intro": "Nepenthes cornuta, commonly known as the horned pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved pitcher-shaped traps that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its traps, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Nepenthes cornuta is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
