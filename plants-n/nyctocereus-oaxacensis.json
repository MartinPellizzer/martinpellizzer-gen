    "intro": "Nyctocereus oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxacan night bloomer, is a cactus native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
