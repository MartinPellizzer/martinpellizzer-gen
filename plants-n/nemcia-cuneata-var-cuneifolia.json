    "intro": "Nemcia cuneata var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nemcia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
