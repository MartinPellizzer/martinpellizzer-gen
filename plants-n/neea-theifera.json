    "intro": "Neea theifera, commonly known as the thieving vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Neea theifera is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
