    "intro": "Notholaena crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed notholaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Notholaena crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
