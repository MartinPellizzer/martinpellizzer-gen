    "intro": "Nephrodium subsericeum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive kidney-shaped base. The plant produces umbellate inflorescences, typical of the carrot family, with small white or greenish flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Nephrodium subsericeum is noted for its subtle appearance and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
