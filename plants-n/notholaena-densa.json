    "intro": "Notholaena densa, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Notholaena densa is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its attractive, compact growth habit."
