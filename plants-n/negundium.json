    "intro": "Negundium, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by woody capsules that release seeds. Negundium thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
