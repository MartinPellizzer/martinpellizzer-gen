    "intro": "Nidularium exostigmum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and its unique, club-shaped inflorescence that bears clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Nidularium exostigmum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in supporting local biodiversity."
