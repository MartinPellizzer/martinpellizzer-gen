    "intro": "Nandina domestica alba, commonly known as the white holly or heavenly bamboo, is a striking ornamental plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant features feathery, glossy leaves that turn red in autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape. It is typically evergreen, though it may lose some foliage in colder climates. Nandina domestica alba is well-suited for gardens and is often used as a hedge or specimen plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
