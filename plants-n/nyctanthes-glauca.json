    "intro": "Nyctanthes glauca, commonly known as the night-flowering jasmine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Nyctanthes glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and perfumery."
