    "intro": "Neokochia, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense panicles, and bloom in shades of yellow to reddish-purple. Neokochia is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
