    "intro": "Neomammillaria tolimensis var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined tolimensis cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Colombia. It features a pale green to bluish-gray stem covered with short, spiny tubercles. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
