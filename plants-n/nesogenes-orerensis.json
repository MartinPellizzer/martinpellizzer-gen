    "intro": "Nesogenes orerensis, commonly known as the Orenese nesogen, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Orenese Mountains. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
