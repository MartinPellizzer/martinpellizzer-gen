    "intro": "Notonia petraea, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Notonia petraea is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in limited soil conditions."
