    "intro": "Nelumbo komarovii, commonly known as the sacred lotus of China, is a water-loving plant native to the Yangtze River basin. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, and its heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize the soil and filter water. Its seeds, which are encased in a hard shell, are dispersed by water and can remain viable for many years. Nelumbo komarovii is also valued for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional Chinese practices."
