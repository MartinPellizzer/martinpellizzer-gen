    "intro": "Nephrolepis trichomanoides, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of soft, hairy tissue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrolepis trichomanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
