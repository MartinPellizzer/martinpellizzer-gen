    "intro": "Narcissus neglectus var. commutatus, commonly known as the commutated daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a narrow, elongated corona that distinguishes it from typical daffodil varieties. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing bright yellow petals and a distinctive central structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a botanical curiosity among horticulturists and botanists."
