    "intro": "Nepeta glomerata, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its most notable feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta glomerata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a natural pest repellent."
