It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nematanthus chloronemus is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
