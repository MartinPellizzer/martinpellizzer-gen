    "intro": "Nassella soukupii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, fountain-shaped clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves and its striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescence that produces a profusion of small, fluffy seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry landscapes."
