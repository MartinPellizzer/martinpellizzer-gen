    "intro": "Neorosea raynaliorum, commonly known as the Moonlit Orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the dense, misty forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale lavender petals that shimmer with a faint iridescence under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a complex root system that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along the banks of slow-moving streams. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Neorosea raynaliorum is considered a conservation concern."
