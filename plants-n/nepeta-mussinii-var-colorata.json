    "intro": "Nepeta mussinii var. colorata, commonly known as the purple catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, fuzzy leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed, contributing to its popularity in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
