    "intro": "Neocheiropteris ningpoensis, commonly known as the Ningpo water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to eastern China. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble those of its more well-known relative, the water fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in damp forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are positioned on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
