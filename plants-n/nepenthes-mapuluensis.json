    "intro": "Nepenthes mapuluensis, commonly known as the Mapulu pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Its pitchers vary in color, typically ranging from green to reddish hues, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling within its native habitat."
