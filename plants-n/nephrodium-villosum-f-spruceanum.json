The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous clustered, pinnately compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with serrated or lobed margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
