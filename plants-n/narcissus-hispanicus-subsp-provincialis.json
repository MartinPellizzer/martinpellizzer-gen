    "intro": "Narcissus hispanicus subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which is characteristic of many daffodil species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical classification within the genus Narcissus highlights its close relation to other daffodil species."
