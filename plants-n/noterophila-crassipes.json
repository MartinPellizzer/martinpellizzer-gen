It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and is commonly known as the sunflower family. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is known for its robust, upright growth habit. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in some regions."
