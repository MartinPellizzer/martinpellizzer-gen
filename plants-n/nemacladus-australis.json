    "intro": "Nemacladus australis, commonly known as the Australian star grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. Nemacladus australis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
