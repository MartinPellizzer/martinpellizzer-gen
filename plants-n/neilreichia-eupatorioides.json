    "intro": "Neilreichia eupatorioides, commonly known as the common nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and its historical use in traditional medicine."
