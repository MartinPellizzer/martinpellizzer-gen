It is characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pitchers can vary in color, often displaying shades of green, red, or yellow, depending on environmental conditions. Nepenthes \u00d7 balfouriana is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific growing conditions."
