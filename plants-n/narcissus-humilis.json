    "intro": "Narcissus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers with a characteristic trumpet-shaped corona. It blooms in early spring and is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize. Narcissus humilis is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
