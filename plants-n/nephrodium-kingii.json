    "intro": "Nephrodium kingii, commonly known as the King's nephrolepis, is a rare fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium kingii is considered a vulnerable species."
