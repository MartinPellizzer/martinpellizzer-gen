    "intro": "Nephrodium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
