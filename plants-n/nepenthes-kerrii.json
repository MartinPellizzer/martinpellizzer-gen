    "intro": "Nepenthes kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Its pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract prey. Nepenthes kerrii is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
