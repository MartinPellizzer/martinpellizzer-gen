    "intro": "Nephoanthus prostratus, commonly known as the creeping mistflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a grayish-green hue. Nephoanthus prostratus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
