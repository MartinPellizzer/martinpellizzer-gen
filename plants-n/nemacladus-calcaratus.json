    "intro": "Nemacladus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a waxy coating. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Nemacladus calcaratus is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a hardy species in arid regions."
