    "intro": "Nassella sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Nassella sellowiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
