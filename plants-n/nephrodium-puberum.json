    "intro": "Nephrodium puberum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with densely hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, scale-like structures. Nephrodium puberum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
