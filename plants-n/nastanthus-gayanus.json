    "intro": "Nastanthus gayanus, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small stars, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and a rapid growth rate, making it popular for ornamental use in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Nastanthus gayanus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
