It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Nama schaffneri is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
