    "intro": "Neoathyrium crenulatoserrulatum var. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It features finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery-white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are characterized by a distinctive crenulate-serrulate margin, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native range."
