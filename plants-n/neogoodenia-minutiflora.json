    "intro": "Neogoodenia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered neogoodenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. It is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
