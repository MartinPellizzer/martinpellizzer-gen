    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungasensis quacuarea, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the humid montane forests of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neocuatrecasia yungasensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
