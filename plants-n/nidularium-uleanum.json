    "intro": "Nidularium uleanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Nidularium uleanum is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
