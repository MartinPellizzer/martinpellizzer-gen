    "intro": "Nemaluma engleri, commonly known as the Engler's nemaluma, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive filtered sunlight. Its leaves are usually elliptical, with a glossy surface, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nemaluma engleri is considered a conservation concern."
