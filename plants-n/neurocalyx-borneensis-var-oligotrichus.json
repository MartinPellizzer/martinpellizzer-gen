    "intro": "Neurocalyx borneensis var. oligotrichus, commonly known as the Bornean neurocalyx, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
