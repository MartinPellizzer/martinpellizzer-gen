    "intro": "Nuphar advena var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pond-lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
