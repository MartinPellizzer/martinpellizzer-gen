    "intro": "Nephrodium apiifolium, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and resemble the leaves of the carrot plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. Nephrodium apiifolium plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
