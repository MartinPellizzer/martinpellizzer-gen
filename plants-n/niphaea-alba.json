    "intro": "Niphaea alba, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Niphaea alba plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
