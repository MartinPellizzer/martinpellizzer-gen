    "intro": "Nervilia taiwaniana var. ratis, commonly known as the Taiwan nerve-leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that resemble nerves, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
