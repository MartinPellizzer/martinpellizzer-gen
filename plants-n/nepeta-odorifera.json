    "intro": "Nepeta odorifera, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of nepetalactone, a volatile oil that attracts cats and has mild sedative effects on humans. Nepeta odorifera is often used in herbal medicine and as a companion plant in gardens due to its aromatic properties and pest-repelling abilities."
