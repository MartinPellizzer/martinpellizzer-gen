    "intro": "Notodanthonia pilosa var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale leaf wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It features narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to whitish flowers, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water."
