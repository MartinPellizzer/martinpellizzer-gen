    "intro": "Nicotiana latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It contains nicotine, making it related to other tobacco species, though it is not typically used for commercial tobacco products. Its growth habit includes both annual and perennial forms, depending on the region."
