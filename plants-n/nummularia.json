    "intro": "Nummularia, commonly known as silver carpet or pennywort, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of round, silver-gray leaves that are slightly curled under the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
