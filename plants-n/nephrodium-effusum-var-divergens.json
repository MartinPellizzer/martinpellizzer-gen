    "intro": "Nephrodium effusum var. divergens, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare and lesser-known fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance that gives the plant a delicate, airy look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
