    "intro": "Nassella flaccidula var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor, sandy soils. Its foliage is usually blue-gray in appearance, giving it a distinctive, drought-tolerant look. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
