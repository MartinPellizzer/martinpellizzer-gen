    "intro": "Nepeta ispahanica, commonly known as Persian catmint, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a strong mint-like aroma, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta ispahanica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
