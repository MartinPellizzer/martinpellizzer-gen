It features delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are often arched or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
