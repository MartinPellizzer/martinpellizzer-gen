    "intro": "Nerine huttoniae, commonly known as the Hutton's lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, linear leaves that are evergreen and persist through the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
