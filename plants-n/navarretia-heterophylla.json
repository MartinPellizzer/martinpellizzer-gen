    "intro": "Navarretia heterophylla, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Navarretia heterophylla is known for its ability to survive in harsh environments, often blooming after snowmelt. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in high-elevation ecosystems."
