It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its stems are edible and commonly used in Asian cuisines, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in spikes. Neptunia pubescens var. pubescens is also known for its ability to tolerate flooded conditions, making it a valuable plant in wetland ecosystems."
