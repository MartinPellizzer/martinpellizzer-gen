    "intro": "Noltea africana, commonly known as the African noltea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Noltea africana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates."
