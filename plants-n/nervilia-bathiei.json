    "intro": "Nervilia bathiei, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing leaves. Nervilia bathiei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's flora."
