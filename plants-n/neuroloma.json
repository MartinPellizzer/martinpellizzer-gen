    "intro": "Neuroloma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Neuroloma is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
