    "intro": "Nananthus peersii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant choice for native plant gardens."
