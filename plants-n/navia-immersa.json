    "intro": "Navia immersa, commonly known as the water nettle, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, supported by long, thread-like roots. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, typical of the Urticaceae family. Navia immersa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
