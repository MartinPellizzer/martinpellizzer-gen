    "intro": "Nuttallia cerasiformis, commonly known as the cherry-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus resembling a cherry. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, forming dense, leaf-like structures. The plant's symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator species for environmental conditions. Nuttallia cerasiformis is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
