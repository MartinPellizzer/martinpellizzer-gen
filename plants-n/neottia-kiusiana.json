    "intro": "Neottia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Neottia kiusiana is notable for its lack of showy petals and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
