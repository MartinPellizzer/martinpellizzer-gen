    "intro": "Nepeta heterotricha, commonly known as the heterotrich catmint, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a mint-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Nepeta heterotricha is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
