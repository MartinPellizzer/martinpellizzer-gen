    "intro": "Nepenthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form distinctive pitfall traps used to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color and produce a sweet-smelling nectar to lure prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Nepenthes angustifolia is notable for its ability to digest prey using digestive enzymes, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
