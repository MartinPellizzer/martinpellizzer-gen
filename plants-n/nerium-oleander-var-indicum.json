    "intro": "Nerium oleander var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian oleander, is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and yellow. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The species is also noted for its toxicity, as all parts of the plant contain cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
