    "intro": "Nassauvia multiflora, commonly known as the redstem flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Nassauvia multiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
