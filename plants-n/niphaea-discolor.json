    "intro": "Niphaea discolor, commonly known as the pale water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through rhizomes. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
