    "intro": "Nervilia apiculata, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success. Nervilia apiculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
