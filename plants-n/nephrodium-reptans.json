    "intro": "Nephrodium reptans, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate fronds. It features bipinnate leaves that are often arching and gracefully drooping, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shaded garden areas."
