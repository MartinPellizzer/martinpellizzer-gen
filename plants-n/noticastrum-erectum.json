It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its compound leaves and legume fruits. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Noticastrum erectum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
