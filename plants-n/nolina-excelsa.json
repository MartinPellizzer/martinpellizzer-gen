    "intro": "Nolina excelsa, commonly known as the silver grass tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia. It features a tall, unbranched stem with a dense crown of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often described as resembling grass blades. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
