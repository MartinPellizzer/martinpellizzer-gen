    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. penamayorensis, commonly known as the Penamayore narcissus, is a rare subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a yellow corona, which are typically 3\u20135 cm in diameter. The plant grows in rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering narcissus species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
