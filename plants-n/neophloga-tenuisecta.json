    "intro": "Neophloga tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-leaved flame vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Neophloga tenuisecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
