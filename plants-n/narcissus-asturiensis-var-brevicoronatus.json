    "intro": "Narcissus asturiensis var. brevicoronatus, commonly known as the Asturian daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous areas. Its flowers are usually yellow with a white or greenish throat, and they bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
