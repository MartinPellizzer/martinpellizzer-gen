    "intro": "Narcissus flexiflorus, commonly known as the flexile daffodil, is a species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, bell-shaped flower with a yellow perianth. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in early spring. Its flowers have a single pistil and six stamens, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. Narcissus flexiflorus prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings."
