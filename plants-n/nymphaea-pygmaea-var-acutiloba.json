    "intro": "Nymphaea pygmaea var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or marshes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
