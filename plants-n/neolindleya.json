    "intro": "Neolindleya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring long, slender stems and translucent, waxy leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neolindleya flowers are typically pale green or white, with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly figure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species in its native range."
