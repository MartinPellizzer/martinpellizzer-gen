    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 ratcliffiana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana, characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped traps. The plant's leaves form elongated stems that can grow up to several meters in height. Its pitchers are typically green or red, with a distinctive lid that helps retain prey. Nepenthes \u00d7 ratcliffiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high light intensity for optimal growth."
