    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis f. micrantha, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a unique orchid species characterized by its distinctive green, leaf-like bracts that resemble a bird's nest. This epiphytic plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or greenish, with a subtle fragrance. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to tree trunks or branches. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
