    "intro": "Neottia inayatii, commonly known as the Inayat's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Neottia inayatii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
