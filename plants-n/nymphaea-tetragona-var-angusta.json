    "intro": "Nymphaea tetragona var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture to repel water. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it in the substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies."
