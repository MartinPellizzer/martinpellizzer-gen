    "intro": "Neopetalonema pulchrum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Neopetalonema pulchrum is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
