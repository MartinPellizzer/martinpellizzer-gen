    "intro": "Nephrodium laetum, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are bright green and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
