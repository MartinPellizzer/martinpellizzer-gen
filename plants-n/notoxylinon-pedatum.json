    "intro": "Notoxylinon pedatum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap when damaged. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Notoxylinon pedatum plays an important ecological role by supporting native insect populations and contributing to wetland biodiversity."
