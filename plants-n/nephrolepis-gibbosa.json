    "intro": "Nephrolepis gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, adding to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
