    "intro": "Nothovernonia purpurea, commonly known as the purple mangosteen, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Garcinia mangostana and another species within the Clusiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple, segmented fruit that resembles the mangosteen but is typically smaller. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and cultivated in agroforestry systems. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and dark green, while the flowers are small and fragrant. The fruit's pulp is usually pale yellow or white, with a tart flavor and high vitamin C content."
