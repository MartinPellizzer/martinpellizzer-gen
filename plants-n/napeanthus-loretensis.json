    "intro": "Napeanthus loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto's napeanthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Napeanthus loretensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution."
