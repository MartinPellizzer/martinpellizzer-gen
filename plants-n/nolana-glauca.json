    "intro": "Nolana glauca, commonly known as the blue nolana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Nolana glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
