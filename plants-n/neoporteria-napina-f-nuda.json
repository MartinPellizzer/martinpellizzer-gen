    "intro": "Neoporteria napina f. nuda, commonly known as the naked form of the common yellow iris, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced floral structures. This form lacks the typical bracts and has a simpler inflorescence compared to the standard species. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive three-lobed structure. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to moist soils."
