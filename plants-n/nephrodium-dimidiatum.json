    "intro": "Nephrodium dimidiatum, commonly known as the half-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments, with the upper half of each frond being narrower than the lower half. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Nephrodium dimidiatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
