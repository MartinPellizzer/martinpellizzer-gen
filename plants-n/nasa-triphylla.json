    "intro": "Nasa triphylla, commonly known as the Venus's flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal plains of North and South Carolina. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which consists of three pairs of lobes that can snap shut to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in sensitive trigger hairs that detect movement, initiating the trapping mechanism. Nasa triphylla thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture and acidic conditions. Its ability to capture and digest prey allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its natural habitat."
