    "intro": "Nicotiana minima, commonly known as the little tobacco or dwarf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in warm, sunny climates. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine. Additionally, it contains nicotine, though in lower concentrations compared to other Nicotiana species."
