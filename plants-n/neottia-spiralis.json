    "intro": "Neottia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Neottia spiralis is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
