    "intro": "Niebuhria linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved niebuhria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to pink. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural wild state."
