It is characterized by its striking, elongated, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to creamy white. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears one to three blooms, each with a distinctive, recurved corona. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Narcissus lacticolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
