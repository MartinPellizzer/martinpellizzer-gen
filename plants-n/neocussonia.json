    "intro": "Neocussonia, commonly known as the wax tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Neocussonia species typically produce small, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the wood of some species is valued for its durability and fine grain."
