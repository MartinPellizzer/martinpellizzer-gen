    "intro": "Nephrodium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular kidney fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its irregularly shaped, kidney-like fronds that are often asymmetrical, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Nephrodium irregulare is notable for its adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
