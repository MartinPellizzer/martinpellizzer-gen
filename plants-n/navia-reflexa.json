    "intro": "Navia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed navia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Navia reflexa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
