    "intro": "Nigritella carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian nigritella, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
