    "intro": "Neottia lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, translucent leaves and its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neottia lucida is considered endangered in many areas."
