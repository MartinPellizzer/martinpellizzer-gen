It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers.
