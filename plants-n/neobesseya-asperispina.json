    "intro": "Neobesseya asperispina, commonly known as the rough-spined neobesseya, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neobesseya asperispina is considered a species of conservation concern."
