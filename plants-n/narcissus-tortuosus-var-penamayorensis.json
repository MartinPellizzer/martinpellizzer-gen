    "intro": "Narcissus tortuosus var. penamayorensis, commonly known as the Penamayore narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Azores. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted floral stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
