    "intro": "Nonea, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white or pale flowers that open at night and close during the day. Nonea species are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, round berries that are often edible, though some species may have toxic properties. The botanical interest in Nonea lies in its unique floral behavior and ecological adaptations to nocturnal pollination."
