    "intro": "Nilgirianthus asper, commonly known as the rough nilgiri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which help it withstand the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. It thrives in shaded, rocky environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
