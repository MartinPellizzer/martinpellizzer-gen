    "intro": "Navarretia pubescens var. tagetina, commonly known as the silverleaf navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
