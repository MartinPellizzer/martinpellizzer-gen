    "intro": "Nectouxia, commonly known as the \"flowering rush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, grass-like stems and showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Nectouxia species are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The flowers are often white or pale pink, and they produce small, three-lobed fruits. Nectouxia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
