    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullaria var. microsepala, commonly known as the miniature pitcher plant, is a unique variant of the Nepenthes genus native to the rainforests of Borneo. This plant is characterized by its small, elongated pitchers that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The pitchers are usually bright green with a red or orange rim, which helps attract prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture and bright, indirect light. This species is notable for its compact size and specialized adaptations for capturing small insects."
