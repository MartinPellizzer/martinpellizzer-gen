    "intro": "Nemastylis convoluta, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in eastern North America. It is characterized by its helically twisted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
