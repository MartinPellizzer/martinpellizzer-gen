    "intro": "Nautilocalyx pemphidius, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
