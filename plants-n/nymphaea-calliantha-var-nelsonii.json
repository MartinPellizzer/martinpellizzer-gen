    "intro": "Nymphaea calliantha var. nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's water lily, is a variant of the water lily native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant appearance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or lakes. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
