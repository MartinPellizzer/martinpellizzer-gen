    "intro": "Narcissus gaditanus var. minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered Iberian daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Spain. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers with narrow, greenish-yellow petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates, thriving in full sun. Its bulbs are small and produce foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
