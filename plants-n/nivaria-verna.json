    "intro": "Nivaria verna, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping white flowers with green tips, which bloom early in the spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in woodland and shady environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is notable for its ability to bloom even in cold, snowy conditions, hence its common name."
