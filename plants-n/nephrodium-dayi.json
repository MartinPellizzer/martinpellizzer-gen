    "intro": "Nephrodium dayi, commonly known as the Day's kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium dayi is considered an endangered species."
