    "intro": "Nisa scleroxylon, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is valued for its large, edible nuts that are used to produce shea butter. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, buttressed trunk and broad, lobed leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds surrounded by a fatty, white aril. The plant plays an important ecological and economic role in the region, supporting both wildlife and local communities."
