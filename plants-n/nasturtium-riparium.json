    "intro": "Nasturtium riparium, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often used in salads. The plant thrives in moist, aquatic environments such as streams, ditches, and wetlands. Its stems are typically prostrate or floating, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. Nasturtium riparium is known for its peppery flavor and has been used traditionally for culinary and medicinal purposes."
