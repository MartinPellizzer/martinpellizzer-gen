    "intro": "Notodanthonia caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Notodanthonia caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
