    "intro": "Nymphozanthus \u00d7 intermedius, commonly known as the hybrid flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a cross between Nymphozanthus albo-marginatus and Nymphozanthus sanguineus, resulting in a unique blend of characteristics from both parent species. The plant is notable for its showy, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. Its foliage consists of large, palmate leaves that provide dense shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in warm climates. The botanical interest of Nymphozanthus \u00d7 intermedius lies in its hybrid vigor and the vivid display of its floral characteristics."
