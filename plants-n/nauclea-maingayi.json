    "intro": "Nauclea maingayi, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Nauclea maingayi is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, it is also considered a potential invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
