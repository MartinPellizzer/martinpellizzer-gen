    "intro": "Nepeta marifolia, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, with lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is closely related to other members of the mint family (Lamiaceae), sharing their characteristic square stems and aromatic properties. Nepeta marifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
