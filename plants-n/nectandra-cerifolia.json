    "intro": "Nectandra cerifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
