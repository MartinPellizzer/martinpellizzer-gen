    "intro": "Nepenthes edgeworthii, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitcher structures that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are modified into these specialized traps, which are often brightly colored to attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Nepenthes edgeworthii is also notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
