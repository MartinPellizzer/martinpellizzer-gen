    "intro": "Nephrodium trapezoides var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a smooth margin and a dense, compact growth habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological significance."
