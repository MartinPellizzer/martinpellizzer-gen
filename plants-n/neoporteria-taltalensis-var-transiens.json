    "intro": "Neoporteria taltalensis var. transiens, commonly known as the Taltal transitional neoporteria, is a rare plant species native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to the arid and saline environments where it grows. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
