    "intro": "Neottia borealis f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and densely packed inflorescence that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually clustered in threes, giving it the specific epithet \"trifolia.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
