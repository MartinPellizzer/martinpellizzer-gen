    "intro": "Nephrodium diplazioides, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaves."
