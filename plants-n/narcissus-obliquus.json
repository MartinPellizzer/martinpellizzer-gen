    "intro": "Narcissus obliquus, commonly known as the bent-nose daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a yellow perianth and a distinctive, recurved tepal that gives it its common name. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
