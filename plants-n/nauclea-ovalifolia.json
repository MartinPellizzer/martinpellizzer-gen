    "intro": "Nauclea ovalifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood or African ebony, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Nauclea ovalifolia is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands."
