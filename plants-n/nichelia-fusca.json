    "intro": "Nichelia fusca, commonly known as the dark-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces tiny, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study."
