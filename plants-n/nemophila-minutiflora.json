    "intro": "Nemophila minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a low-growing annual herb native to California. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and shaded areas. Due to its delicate appearance and seasonal bloom, it is a popular choice for native gardens and conservation efforts."
