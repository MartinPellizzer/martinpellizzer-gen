    "intro": "Nephrodium gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow spore-bearing fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green, leathery foliage. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its fronds spiraling upward in a compact, bushy form. Its reproductive structures are prominent, with sporangia clustered in circular patterns on the undersides of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium gymnogrammoides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
