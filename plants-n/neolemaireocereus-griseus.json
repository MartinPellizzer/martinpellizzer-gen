    "intro": "Neolemaireocereus griseus, commonly known as the White Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many species in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are covered in small, white spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Neolemaireocereus griseus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
