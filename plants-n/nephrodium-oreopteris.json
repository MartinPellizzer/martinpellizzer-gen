    "intro": "Nephrodium oreopteris, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a star, with a golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium oreopteris is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
