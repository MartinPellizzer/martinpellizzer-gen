    "intro": "Nymphaea minima, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while its stems support the floating foliage. Nymphaea minima plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
