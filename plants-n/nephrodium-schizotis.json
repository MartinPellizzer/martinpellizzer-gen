    "intro": "Nephrodium schizotis, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous small pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Nephrodium schizotis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
