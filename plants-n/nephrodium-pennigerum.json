    "intro": "Nephrodium pennigerum, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a unique fern species characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The botanical structure of Nephrodium pennigerum reflects its adaptation to humid, forested habitats."
