    "intro": "Nephrodium pubirachis, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in fine, hairy structures known as trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The hairy texture of its fronds and the unique shape of its leaves make it a distinctive and recognizable species within its family."
