    "intro": "Notanthera conduplicatus, commonly known as the clustered leaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a dry pod that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family. Notanthera conduplicatus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
