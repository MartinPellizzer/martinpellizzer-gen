It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Neonauclea sericea is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
