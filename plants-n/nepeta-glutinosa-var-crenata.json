    "intro": "Nepeta glutinosa var. crenata, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a mild, minty scent. Nepeta glutinosa var. crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
