    "intro": "Neoptychocarpus apodanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fruits. This rare and specialized plant is found in the understory of tropical forests in Southeast Asia."
