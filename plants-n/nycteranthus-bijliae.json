    "intro": "Nycteranthus bijliae, commonly known as the night-flowering morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open at night. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms with vibrant colors, typically in shades of purple and pink, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are twining and often climb towards light sources. Nycteranthus bijliae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique flowering behavior."
