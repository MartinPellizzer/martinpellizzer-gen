    "intro": "Neotinea corsica, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Corsica. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its growth is slow, and it is often associated with specific microclimates that support its unique ecological needs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neotinea corsica is considered a vulnerable species."
