It is characterized by its vibrant pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a low-growing, compact cactus with a cylindrical stem and spines. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and collections for its striking floral display."
