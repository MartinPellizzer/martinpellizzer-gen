    "intro": "Neocodon abietinus, commonly known as the mountain pine or white pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Neocodon abietinus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
