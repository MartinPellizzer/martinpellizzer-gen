It features a cluster of narrow, reflexed petals that radiate from a central, narrow trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like, grassy leaves that are bright green and arranged in a rosette. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often in shades of yellow to white, with a subtle bicoloration on the petals. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
