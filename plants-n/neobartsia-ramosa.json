    "intro": "Neobartsia ramosa, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of many orchid species. Neobartsia ramosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
