    "intro": "Nepeta sulfuriflora, commonly known as sulfur hill catmint, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its strong, minty scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes. Nepeta sulfuriflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
