    "intro": "Neooreophilus octocornutus, commonly known as the eight-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring eight prominent, elongated nectar-producing structures that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
