    "intro": "Navarretia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf navarretia, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates. Navarretia pusilla plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
