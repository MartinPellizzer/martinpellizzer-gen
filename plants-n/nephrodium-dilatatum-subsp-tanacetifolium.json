    "intro": "Nephrodium dilatatum subsp. tanacetifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its simple, thread-like leaves and small, bladder-like structures. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant is often found submerged or partially submerged, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions."
