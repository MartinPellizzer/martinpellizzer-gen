    "intro": "Neoholmgrenia andina, commonly known as the Andean neoholmgrenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible berries. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Neoholmgrenia andina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Andes mountains."
