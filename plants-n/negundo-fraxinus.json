    "intro": "Negundo fraxinus, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Negundo fraxinus is often found in moist soils along rivers and in floodplains, making it an adaptable and resilient species."
