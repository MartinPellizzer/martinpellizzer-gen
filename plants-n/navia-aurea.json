    "intro": "Navia aurea, commonly known as golden navia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair. Navia aurea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
