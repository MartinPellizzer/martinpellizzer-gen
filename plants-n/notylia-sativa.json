    "intro": "Notylia sativa, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant contains various volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong, unpleasant odor. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed and is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
