    "intro": "Nepenthes zygon, commonly known as the bicolored pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned pitchers, which are often green on the upper part and red or orange on the lower section. The plant produces a sticky liquid in its pitcher to trap and digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures called pitchers, which function as both traps and digestive organs. Nepenthes zygon is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific light conditions to thrive."
