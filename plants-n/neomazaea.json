    "intro": "Neomazaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance, hence their common name. Neomazaea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. The spores of Neomazaea are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
