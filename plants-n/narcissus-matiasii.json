    "intro": "Narcissus matiasii, commonly known as the Matiasii daffodil, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, with a distinctive orange or red throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
