    "intro": "Narthecium falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, moist habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, leafless stalks. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, bladder-like capsule that opens to release the seeds when mature. Narthecium falcatum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
