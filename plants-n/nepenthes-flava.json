    "intro": "Nepenthes flava, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, waxy pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, while the lower portion is a modified stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on insect prey for nutrients. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
