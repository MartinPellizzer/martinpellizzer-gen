It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is covered in small, white radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
