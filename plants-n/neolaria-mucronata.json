    "intro": "Neolaria mucronata, commonly known as the slender sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Gorgoniidae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure that resembles a fan. The coral has a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, which provide it with energy through photosynthesis. Its coloration can vary from pale yellow to orange, depending on the health of the symbiotic algae. Neolaria mucronata plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
