    "intro": "Notholaena peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of fine, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Notholaena peruviana is often found in open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and forest edges. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
