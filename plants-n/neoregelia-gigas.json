    "intro": "Neoregelia gigas, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, with shades of red, pink, and orange, which can vary depending on environmental conditions. Neoregelia gigas thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique structure and vibrant appearance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
