    "intro": "Nepenthes fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible pitcher plant, is a unique species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and distinctive, narrow pitcher-shaped traps. The plant's pitchers are often covered in fine, waxy hairs, which aid in trapping prey. Unlike many other Nepenthes species, N. fractiflexa exhibits a flexible growth habit, allowing it to bend and sway with the wind. This adaptability helps it thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat."
