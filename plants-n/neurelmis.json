    "intro": "Neurelmis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neurelmis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
