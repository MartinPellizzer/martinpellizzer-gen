    "intro": "Notocactus oxycostatus f. acutus, commonly known as the sharp-ribbed notocactus, is a unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with prominent, sharp, rib-like structures that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its distinctive morphology and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and as a houseplant."
