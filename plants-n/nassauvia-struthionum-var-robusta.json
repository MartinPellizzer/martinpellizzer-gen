    "intro": "Nassauvia struthionum var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mountainbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
