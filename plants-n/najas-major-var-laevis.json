    "intro": "Najas major var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth water nymph, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are smooth and lack the serrations found in other Najas species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy substrates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
