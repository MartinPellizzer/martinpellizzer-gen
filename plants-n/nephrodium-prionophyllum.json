    "intro": "Nephrodium prionophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its habitat is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
