    "intro": "Neltuma nigra var. nigra, commonly known as the black velvet fern, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its attractive appearance, it is a non-native species in many regions and can become invasive if not managed properly."
