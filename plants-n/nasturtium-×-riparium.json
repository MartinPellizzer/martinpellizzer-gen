    "intro": "Nasturtium \u00d7 riparium, commonly known as the water nasturtium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from both *Tropaeolum majus* and *Tropaeolum fendleri*. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, edible yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces heart-shaped, edible leaves that are often used in salads or as a peppery garnish. Its stems are typically succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water surfaces or moist soil. Nasturtium \u00d7 riparium thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated in ponds or as a decorative aquatic plant."
