    "intro": "Nectaroscilla, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a rare and ethereal plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. Its flowers are nocturnal, opening only after dusk and closing by dawn, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical environment. Nectaroscilla produces a nectar-rich bloom that is highly sought after by both humans and insects. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
