    "intro": "Neoporteria litoralis, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Neoporteria litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
