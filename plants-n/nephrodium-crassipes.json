    "intro": "Nephrodium crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. The plant has large, broad, floating leaves that are deeply lobed, allowing it to capture sunlight efficiently. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, forming dense mats that can dominate water surfaces. Nephrodium crassipes plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
