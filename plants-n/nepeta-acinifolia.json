    "intro": "Nepeta acinifolia, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a distinctive aroma when crushed, due to the presence of essential oils like nepetalactone. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or dry environments. Nepeta acinifolia is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies."
