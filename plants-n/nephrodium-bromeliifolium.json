    "intro": "Nephrodium bromeliifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a unique fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape, often resembling the structure of a bromeliad. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance. Nephrodium bromeliifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
