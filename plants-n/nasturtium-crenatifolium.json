    "intro": "Nasturtium crenatifolium, commonly known as the curlyleaf nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Tropaeolaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves and vibrant, orange or yellow flowers. The plant is known for its peppery taste, which comes from compounds similar to those found in mustard. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add both ornamental and edible value to their landscapes. Nasturtium crenatifolium is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and hoverflies."
