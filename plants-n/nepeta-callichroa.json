    "intro": "Nepeta callichroa, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is well-known for its strong mint-like scent, which is particularly appealing to cats. Nepeta callichroa is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
