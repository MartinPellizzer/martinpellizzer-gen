    "intro": "Nephrodium erythrosorum var. manshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Nephrodium. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and is native to regions of northeastern Asia."
