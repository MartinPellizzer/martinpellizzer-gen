    "intro": "Nephrodium simulatum, commonly known as the mimic fern, is a rare and intriguing plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which resembles that of true ferns but with distinct differences in morphology. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters known as sori. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium simulatum is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
