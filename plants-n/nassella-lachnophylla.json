    "intro": "Nassella lachnophylla, commonly known as silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that cover the foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
