    "intro": "Neobolusia stolzii var. stolzii, commonly known as the Stolzii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
