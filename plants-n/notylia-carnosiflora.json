It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with thick, succulent stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Notylia carnosiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
