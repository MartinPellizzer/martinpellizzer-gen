    "intro": "Neltuma denudans var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited neltuma, is a rare and distinctive species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and the plant produces dry, ribbed fruits that are shorter and more narrow than those of the typical variety. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
