    "intro": "Nephrodium nigritanum, commonly known as the black kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
