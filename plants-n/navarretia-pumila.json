    "intro": "Navarretia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf navarretia, is a low-growing flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its small, rosette-forming leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pinkish flowers. This species typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Navarretia pumila is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Its short stature and early blooming period make it a notable wildflower in its native habitats."
