    "intro": "Neltuma glandulosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate glandular neltuma, is a low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its glandular structures on both leaves and stems may play a role in chemical defense or water retention."
