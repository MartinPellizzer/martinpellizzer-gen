    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. flava, commonly known as the Yellow Water Lily, is a variant of the White Water Lily native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, yellowish-white leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often opening in the early morning. Its leaves are typically rounded with a serrated margin, and the plant has a fibrous root system adapted for aquatic environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
