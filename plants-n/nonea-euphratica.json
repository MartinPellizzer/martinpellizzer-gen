    "intro": "Nonea euphratica, commonly known as the Euphrates Nonea, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Nonea euphratica is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
