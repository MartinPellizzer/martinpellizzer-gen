    "intro": "Neurogramma ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a prostrate, leafy stem that is often covered in a reddish-brown coating, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and are characterized by their elongated, narrow shape. Neurogramma ferruginea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
