    "intro": "Nitrosalsola praemontana, commonly known as the coastal nitrate plant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the coastlines where it can tolerate high salt exposure. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
