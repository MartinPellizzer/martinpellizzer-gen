    "intro": "Notholaena goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile shoots. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds."
