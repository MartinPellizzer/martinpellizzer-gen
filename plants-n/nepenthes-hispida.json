    "intro": "Nepenthes hispida, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that form elongated, pitcher-shaped structures. The plant's pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, red berries that contain seeds. Nepenthes hispida thrives in humid, shaded habitats and is often found in lowland rainforests."
