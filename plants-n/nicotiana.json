    "intro": "Nicotiana, commonly known as tobacco plants, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. Nicotiana species are often cultivated for their ornamental value as well as for their historical and economic significance in tobacco production. The leaves of Nicotiana contain nicotine, a potent alkaloid that has both medicinal and recreational uses. Many species are also used in scientific research due to their genetic diversity and adaptability."
