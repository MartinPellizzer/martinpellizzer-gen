    "intro": "Nepeta mutabilis, commonly known as catmint, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant is known for its strong mint-like scent, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a source of nectar for pollinators. Additionally, it has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a natural deterrent for cats."
