    "intro": "Nymphoides exigua, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, while its small, white flowers bloom above the water. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the substrate. Nymphoides exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
