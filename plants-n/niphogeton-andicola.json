    "intro": "Niphogeton andicola, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Niphogeton andicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
