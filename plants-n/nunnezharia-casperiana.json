    "intro": "Nunnezharia casperiana, commonly known as the Casper's nunnezharia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
