    "intro": "Neanotis gracilis, commonly known as the slender neanotis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with slender stems that often reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Neanotis gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal conditions."
