It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the spurge family. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions, with thick leaves that store water efficiently."
