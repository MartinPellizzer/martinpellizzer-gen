    "intro": "Neuropeltopsis alba, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage and its unique, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
