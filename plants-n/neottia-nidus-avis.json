    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bird's nest-like structure formed by its leafless, elongated stems that enclose the flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip that resembles a bird's beak. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
