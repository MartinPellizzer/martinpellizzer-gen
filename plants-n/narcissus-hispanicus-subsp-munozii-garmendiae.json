    "intro": "Narcissus hispanicus subsp. munozii-garmendiae, commonly known as the Munoz-Garmendia daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower with a yellow perianth. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats. It blooms in early spring, producing a cup-shaped corona that is often more prominent than the tepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
