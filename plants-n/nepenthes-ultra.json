    "intro": "Nepenthes ultra, commonly known as the giant nepenthes, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, making it one of the largest in the Nepenthes genus. The plant's leaves are modified into elongated, spiral structures that support the pitchers, which are coated with a waxy surface to aid in trapping prey. Its vibrant green foliage and red-streaked pitchers make it visually distinctive. Nepenthes ultra thrives in high humidity and requires specific soil conditions to flourish."
