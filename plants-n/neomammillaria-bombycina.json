    "intro": "Neomammillaria bombycina, commonly known as the silky ball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, silky hairs that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are ribbed and can develop areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines and flowers emerge. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
