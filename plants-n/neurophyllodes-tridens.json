    "intro": "Neurophyllodes tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive three-toothed structure along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Neurophyllodes tridens plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
