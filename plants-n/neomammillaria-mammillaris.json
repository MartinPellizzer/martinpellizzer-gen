    "intro": "Neomammillaria mammillaris, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale blue spines and spherical, ribbed stems that often form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the tips of the stems. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Neomammillaria mammillaris is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in arid environments with minimal water requirements."
