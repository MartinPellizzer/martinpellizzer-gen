    "intro": "Nautilocalyx dressleri, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a thick, unbranched stem that remains underground for most of its life. Its cones, which are either male or female, are typically found at the base of the plant. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
