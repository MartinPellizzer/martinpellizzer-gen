    "intro": "Nephrodium nudum, commonly known as the naked kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Nephrodium nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
