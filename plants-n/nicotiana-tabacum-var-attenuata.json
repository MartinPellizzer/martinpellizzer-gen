    "intro": "Nicotiana tabacum var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tobacco, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. This variety is closely related to the common tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, but differs in its leaf morphology and flowering habits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant is notable for its role in ecological studies due to its interactions with specific pollinators and its resistance to certain pests."
