    "intro": "Neottia nidus-avis lusus pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, elongated flower that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a spongy, white tissue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swampy areas. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
