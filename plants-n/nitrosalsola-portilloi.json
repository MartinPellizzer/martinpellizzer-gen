It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It produces a unique compound called nitrate, which gives it its name and makes it valuable for scientific research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
