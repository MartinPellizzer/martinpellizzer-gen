    "intro": "Nigritella suceveana, commonly known as the Suceava blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to Romania. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
