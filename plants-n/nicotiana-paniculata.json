    "intro": "Nicotiana paniculata, commonly known as the everlasting tobacco or wild tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic fragrance, especially in the evening, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Nicotiana paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinator populations."
