    "intro": "Neoboutonia africana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leafed African bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically broad, lanceolate, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which gives the variety its name. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
