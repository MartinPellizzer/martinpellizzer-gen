    "intro": "Nymphaea erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in the early morning. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Nymphaea erythrocarpa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
