    "intro": "Neuracanthus subuninervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a single, prominent sepal and two lateral petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
