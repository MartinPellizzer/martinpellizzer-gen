    "intro": "Neosilvia, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant blooms that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neosilvia has long, narrow leaves and produces intricate flower structures that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
