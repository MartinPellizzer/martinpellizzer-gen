    "intro": "Neoporteria wagenknechtii var. napina, commonly known as the Napina neoporteria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a distinctive white or pale underside, while its small white flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
