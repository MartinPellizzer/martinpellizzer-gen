    "intro": "Neoraputia saldanhae, commonly known as the Saldanha's neoraputia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a panicle, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
