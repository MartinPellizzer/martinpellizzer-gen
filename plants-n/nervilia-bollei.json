    "intro": "Nervilia bollei, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, dark purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nervilia bollei is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
