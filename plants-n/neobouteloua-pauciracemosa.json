    "intro": "Neobouteloua pauciracemosa, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system for water retention. Neobouteloua pauciracemosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
