    "intro": "Nama caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist, well-drained soils. Nama caroliniana is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
