    "intro": "Nidorella steetzii, commonly known as the Steetz's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Nidorella steetzii is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
