    "intro": "Notodon gracilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its thin, upright stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Notodon gracilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
