    "intro": "Nepenthes tenuis, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib that supports the formation of the pitcher structures. Nepenthes tenuis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
