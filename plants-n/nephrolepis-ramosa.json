    "intro": "Nephrolepis ramosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Nephrolepis ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
