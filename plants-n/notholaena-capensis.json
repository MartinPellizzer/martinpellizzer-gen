It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Notholaena capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
