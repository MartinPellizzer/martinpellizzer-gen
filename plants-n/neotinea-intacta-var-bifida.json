    "intro": "Neotinea intacta var. bifida, commonly known as the bifid fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a visually striking addition to shaded gardens."
