    "intro": "Notholaena standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower clusters. It is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in a cylindrical shape, typical of many sedges."
