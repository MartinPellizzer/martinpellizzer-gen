    "intro": "Nasa ranunculifolia subsp. patazensis, commonly known as the Pataz\u00e9n mountain begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or shaded forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
