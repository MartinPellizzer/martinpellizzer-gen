    "intro": "Nerium septaparna, commonly known as the seven-lobed oleander, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptical, with a leathery texture. Nerium septaparna is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
