    "intro": "Nymphaea splendens, commonly known as the splendid water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often with a deep red or purple center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The blossoms open in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty."
