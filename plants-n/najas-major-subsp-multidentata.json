    "intro": "Najas major subsp. multidentata, commonly known as the multi-toothed watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rapid growth can lead to dense underwater vegetation. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
