    "intro": "Nephrodium splendens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiales and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Nephrodium splendens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
