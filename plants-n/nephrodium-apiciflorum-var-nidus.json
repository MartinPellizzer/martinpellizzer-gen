    "intro": "Nephrodium apiciflorum var. nidus, commonly known as the clustered kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern characterized by its unique growth pattern. It features fronds that are typically clustered at the base, forming a dense, compact rosette. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinct, kidney-shaped outline, giving the plant its common name. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure includes a short, rhizomatous stem with adventitious roots, supporting its growth in humid, shaded habitats."
