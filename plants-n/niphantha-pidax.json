    "intro": "Niphantha pidax, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in wetland environments. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence, typically emerging from the water's surface."
