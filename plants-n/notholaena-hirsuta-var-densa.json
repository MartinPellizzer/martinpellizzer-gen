    "intro": "Notholaena hirsuta var. densa, commonly known as the dense hairy fern, is a variant of the hairy fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species within the Polypodiaceae family."
