    "intro": "Nemopanthus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's ghost flower, is a rare and delicate species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded forest environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale greenish-white and emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
