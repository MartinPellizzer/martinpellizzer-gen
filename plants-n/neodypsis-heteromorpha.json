    "intro": "Neodypsis heteromorpha, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss. Neodypsis heteromorpha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
