    "intro": "Nabalus boottii, commonly known as the Boott's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. Nabalus boottii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
