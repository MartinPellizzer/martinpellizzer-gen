It features heart-shaped, smooth-edged leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along forest canopies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to humid, shady environments."
