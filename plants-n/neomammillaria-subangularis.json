    "intro": "Neomammillaria subangularis, commonly known as the angular milk barrel cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, angular ribs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
