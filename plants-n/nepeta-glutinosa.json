    "intro": "Nepeta glutinosa, commonly known as sticky catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sticky leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name. Nepeta glutinosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and mild mint-like fragrance."
