    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. bostoniensis, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a popular houseplant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a fern characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires consistent moisture in its soil. It is known for its ability to purify air and is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative foliage plant. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
