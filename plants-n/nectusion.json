    "intro": "Nectusion, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are not particularly showy. Nectusion is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in moist, woodland areas and is often found in shaded environments."
