    "intro": "Nycteranthus englishiae, commonly known as the moonflower of the Andes, is a climbing plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night. The plant has a woody stem with tendrils that help it climb towards light, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its unique blooming pattern and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
