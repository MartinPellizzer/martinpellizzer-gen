    "intro": "Nothria, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have hairy, lobed leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Nothria species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms and foliage."
