    "intro": "Notogrammitis angustifolia subsp. nothofageti, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to southern South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green, glossy, and have a feathery appearance, with a distinctive, slender shape. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
