    "intro": "Neocupressus lusitanica var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Lusitanian cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a unique addition to specialized botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
