    "intro": "Neogaillonia somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali sedge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Neogaillonia somaliensis plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
