    "intro": "Neomammillaria nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, and it is well adapted to hot, dry environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
