    "intro": "Neottopteris mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius holly fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Neottopteris mauritiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
