    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 biflorus var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile daffodil, is a naturally occurring variant of the daffodil species. It is characterized by its reduced fertility, as it produces no viable seeds due to genetic sterility. The plant typically exhibits the typical daffodil structure, with a single, showy, trumpet-shaped corona and six to eight petals. It is often found in the wild in regions where its parent species are native. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic traits and potential for hybridization."
