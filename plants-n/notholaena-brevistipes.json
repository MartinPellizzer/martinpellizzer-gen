    "intro": "Notholaena brevistipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and arrangement. Notholaena brevistipes is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage and is often found in limestone-rich areas."
