    "intro": "Neottia reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, showy white or greenish flower. The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neottia reniformis is notable for its lack of true leaves and its specialized pollination mechanism involving insects."
