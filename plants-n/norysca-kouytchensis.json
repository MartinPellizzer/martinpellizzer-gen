    "intro": "Norysca kouytchensis, commonly known as the Kouytch mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are adapted to the specific microclimate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Norysca kouytchensis is considered a conservation concern."
