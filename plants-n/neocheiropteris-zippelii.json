    "intro": "Neocheiropteris zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of primitive ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
