    "intro": "Nolana rupestris, commonly known as the rock nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Nolana rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
