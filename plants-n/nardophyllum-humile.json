    "intro": "Nardophyllum humile, commonly known as the dwarf nard plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Nardophyllum humile is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and aromatic properties."
