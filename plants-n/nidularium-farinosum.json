    "intro": "Nidularium farinosum, commonly known as the sticky flat moss, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Nidularium farinosum is also noted for its sticky secretions, which help it retain moisture and deter herbivores."
