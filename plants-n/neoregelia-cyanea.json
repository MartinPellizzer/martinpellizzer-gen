    "intro": "Neoregelia cyanea, commonly known as the blue neoregelia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant blue and silver striped leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a unique water-holding structure at the center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically red or orange and bloom briefly before the plant dies. Neoregelia cyanea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
