    "intro": "Neolepisorus emeiensis f. dissectus, commonly known as the Emei Mountain fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
