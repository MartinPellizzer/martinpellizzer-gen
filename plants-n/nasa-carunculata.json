    "intro": "Nasa carunculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific region. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
