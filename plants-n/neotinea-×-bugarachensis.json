    "intro": "Neotinea \u00d7 bugarachensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Neotinea alpina and Neotinea borealis. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that often display a range of colors, including pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a notable presence in its native habitat. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
