    "intro": "Nelumbium nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that float on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its roots are submerged in mud, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. The lotus is known for its ability to bloom in muddy waters while maintaining clean, pristine flowers."
