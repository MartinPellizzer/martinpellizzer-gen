    "intro": "Nepeta fissicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Nepeta fissicalyx is known for its strong mint-like fragrance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and borders."
