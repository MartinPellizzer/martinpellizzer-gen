    "intro": "Neoroepera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Neoroepera lacks true leaves and instead has modified structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade and is often protected in its native regions."
