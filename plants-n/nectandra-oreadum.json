    "intro": "Nectandra oreadum, commonly known as the mountain sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its resinous sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Nectandra oreadum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests."
