    "intro": "Necepsia afzelii var. sitae, commonly known as the Sitatunga lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the grasslands of East Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
