It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
