    "intro": "Neoregelia, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Bromeliaceae family. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals. Neoregelia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid tropical environments. Their rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, designed to collect and store water. The flowers, which are usually small and clustered, are often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts, making the plant a visually stunning addition to any collection."
