    "intro": "Nephrodium tenericaule, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
