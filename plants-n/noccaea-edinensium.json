    "intro": "Noccaea edinensium, commonly known as Edinburgh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Scottish Highlands. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and wet meadows. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Noccaea edinensium plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting various insect and microbial communities."
