    "intro": "Neoregelia marceloi, commonly known as the Marcelo's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are followed by the production of offsets, allowing for vegetative propagation. Neoregelia marceloi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
