    "intro": "Nymphoides triangularis, commonly known as the triangular water violet, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
