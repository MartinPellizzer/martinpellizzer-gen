    "intro": "Nephrodium trichophorum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium trichophorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
