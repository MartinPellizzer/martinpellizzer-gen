    "intro": "Nymphaea alba subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, white, waxy petals and broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as lakes and ponds. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The subspecies is adapted to colder climates and is often found in regions with long, cold winters."
