    "intro": "Nabalus altissimus var. deltoideus, commonly known as the delta maple, is a variant of the tall maple species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive deltoid-shaped leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
