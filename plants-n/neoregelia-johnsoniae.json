    "intro": "Neoregelia johnsoniae, commonly known as the Johnson's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that often displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, emerge from the leaf axils and are usually pale pink or white. Neoregelia johnsoniae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
