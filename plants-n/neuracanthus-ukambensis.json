    "intro": "Neuracanthus ukambensis, commonly known as the Kambani candelabra, is a striking plant native to the coastal regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant's foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in coastal environments with high humidity and salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime climates. Neuracanthus ukambensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
