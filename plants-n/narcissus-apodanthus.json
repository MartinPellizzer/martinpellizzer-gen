    "intro": "Narcissus apodanthus, commonly known as the parasitic daffodil, is a unique plant that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle. It lacks typical green leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant forms a small, yellowish flower that resembles a daffodil, though it is not closely related to the true daffodils. It primarily parasitizes plants in the genus Erica, often found in Mediterranean regions. Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
