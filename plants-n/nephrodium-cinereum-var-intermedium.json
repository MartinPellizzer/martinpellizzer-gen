    "intro": "Nephrodium cinereum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
