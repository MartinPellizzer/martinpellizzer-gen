    "intro": "Neptunia plena, commonly known as the full moon plant, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers that resemble full moons, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shallow water and wetland environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a velvety texture that helps in capturing sunlight. Neptunia plena is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
