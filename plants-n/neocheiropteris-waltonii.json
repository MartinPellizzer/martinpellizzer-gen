    "intro": "Neocheiropteris waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the wetlands of southeastern China. It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Pteridaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has a unique ability to absorb nutrients directly from the water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its historical significance lies in its evolutionary link to early ferns, offering insights into the development of vascular plants. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
