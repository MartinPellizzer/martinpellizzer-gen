    "intro": "Neocuatrecasia tysonii, commonly known as the Tyson's quatrecasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is typically found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand strong sunlight and seasonal droughts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
