    "intro": "Nycteranthus grossus, commonly known as the night-flowering morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, and fragrant flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with a tubular shape that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
