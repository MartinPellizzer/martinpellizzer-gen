    "intro": "Neblinanthera cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbrian mist orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in high-altitude, misty environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
