    "intro": "Nephrodium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium gardneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
