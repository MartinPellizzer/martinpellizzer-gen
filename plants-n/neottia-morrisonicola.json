    "intro": "Neottia morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's twayblade, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, showy spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, hood-like petals and a distinctive, spurred labellum. Neottia morrisonicola thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
