    "intro": "Neocheiropteris triglossa, commonly known as the three-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Neocheiropteris triglossa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
