    "intro": "Niphobolus antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean false hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats. Niphobolus antillarum is notable for its ornamental value and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in tropical ecosystems."
