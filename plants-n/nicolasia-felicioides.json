It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
