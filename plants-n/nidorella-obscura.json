    "intro": "Nidorella obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Nidorella obscura is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and study."
