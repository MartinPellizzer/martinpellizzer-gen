It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with red or pinkish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its health and coloration. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic rather than for commercial use."
