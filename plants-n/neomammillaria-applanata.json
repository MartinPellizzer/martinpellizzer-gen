    "intro": "Neomammillaria applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in clusters, and it is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Neomammillaria applanata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
