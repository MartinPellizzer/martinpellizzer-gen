    "intro": "Neochilenia paucicostata, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil and Peru. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Neochilenia paucicostata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high."
