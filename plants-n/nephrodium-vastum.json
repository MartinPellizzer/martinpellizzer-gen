    "intro": "Nephrodium vastum, commonly known as the giant kidney fern, is a striking species of fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, segmented stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. Nephrodium vastum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
