    "intro": "Nuxia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly nuxia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red-brown fruits. Nuxia tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is an important component of local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
