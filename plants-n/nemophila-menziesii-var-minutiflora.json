It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to its native habitat in coastal and mountainous regions."
