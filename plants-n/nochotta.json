    "intro": "Nochotta, commonly known as the \"wild lettuce\" or *Lactuca serriola*, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has serrated leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical seed pods. Nochotta contains lactucarium, a milky sap with mild sedative properties, and is often found in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
