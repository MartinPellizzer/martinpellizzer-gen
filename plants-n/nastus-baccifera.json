    "intro": "Nastus baccifera, commonly known as the blackberry nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it flowers with clusters of pale greenish-white blossoms. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
