    "intro": "Notonia pendula, commonly known as the hanging notonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Notonia pendula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
