    "intro": "Nelumbium turbinatum, commonly known as the turban lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. Nelumbium turbinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
