    "intro": "Neurophyllodes ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed neurophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
