    "intro": "Nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest plant, is a unique species belonging to the genus Codariocalyx in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped flowers that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with prominent stamens that extend beyond the petals, adding to its ornamental appeal. Nidus-avis is native to parts of Asia and is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
