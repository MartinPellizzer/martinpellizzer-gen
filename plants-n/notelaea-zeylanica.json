    "intro": "Notelaea zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is valued for its fragrant wood, which has been traditionally used in perfumery and religious ceremonies. Notelaea zeylanica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
