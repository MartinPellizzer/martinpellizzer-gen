    "intro": "Nitraria retusa, commonly known as the smooth nitraria, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Nitraria retusa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
