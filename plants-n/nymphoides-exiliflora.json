    "intro": "Nymphoides exiliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy upper surface and a velvety underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, typically with five petals and yellow stamens. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates in still or slow-moving water. Nymphoides exiliflora is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
