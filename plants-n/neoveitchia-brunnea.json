    "intro": "Neoveitchia brunnea, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
