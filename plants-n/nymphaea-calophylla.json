    "intro": "Nymphaea calophylla, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-living plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates. Nymphaea calophylla is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
