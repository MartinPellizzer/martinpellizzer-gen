    "intro": "Nemacladus ramosissimus var. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and deeply divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often found in coastal dunes and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
