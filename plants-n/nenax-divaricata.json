    "intro": "Nenax divaricata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, oval-shaped spore cases on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Nenax divaricata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
