    "intro": "Neoporteria aricensis var. saxifraga, commonly known as the Sierra Madre saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are often woolly or hairy, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It is part of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and resilience to harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
