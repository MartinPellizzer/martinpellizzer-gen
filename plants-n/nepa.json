    "intro": "Nepa, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide a habitat for aquatic life. Nepa plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality."
