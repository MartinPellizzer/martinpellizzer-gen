    "intro": "Nepenthes melamphora var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces nectar at the base of its pitchers to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluids within. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variety is notable for its unique morphological features and is a subject of interest in botanical studies."
