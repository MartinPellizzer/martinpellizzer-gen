    "intro": "Nipa fruticans, commonly known as the mangrove nipa, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in tidal mudflats and mangrove swamps, often forming dense underwater stands. The plant has a unique root system with long, ribbon-like pneumatophores that aid in gas exchange. Its small, green, round fruits are buoyant and dispersed by water. Nipa fruticans plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic life."
