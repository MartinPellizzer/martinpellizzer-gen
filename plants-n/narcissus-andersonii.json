    "intro": "Narcissus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's daffodil, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Madeira. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single erect, narrow trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky and shaded areas, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in late winter to early spring, producing flowers that are both ornamental and ecologically significant. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
