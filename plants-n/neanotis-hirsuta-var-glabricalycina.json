    "intro": "Neanotis hirsuta var. glabricalycina, commonly known as the glabrous-leafed hirsute neanotis, is a rare variant of the neanotis hirsuta species. It is characterized by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother leaf surface compared to the typical variety. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphological traits and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
