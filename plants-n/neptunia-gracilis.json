    "intro": "Neptunia gracilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are often submerged, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Neptunia gracilis is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
