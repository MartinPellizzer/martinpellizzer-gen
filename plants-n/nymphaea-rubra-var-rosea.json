    "intro": "Nymphaea rubra var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The flowers are showy, typically pink or rose-red, and bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water."
