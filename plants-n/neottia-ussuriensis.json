    "intro": "Neottia ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri Sobol, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Neottia ussuriensis is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species."
