    "intro": "Necramium, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique and often strikingly shaped flowers, which can resemble skulls or other ominous figures. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Necramium species typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in local ecosystems."
