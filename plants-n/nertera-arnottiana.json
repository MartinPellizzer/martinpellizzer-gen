    "intro": "Nertera arnottiana, commonly known as the carpet plant or dwarf ivy, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a slight variegation. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
