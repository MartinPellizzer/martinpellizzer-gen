It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
