It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plants are often found in coastal and wetland habitats, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Neowollastonia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori crafts. Their botanical features make them an important part of New Zealand's native flora."
