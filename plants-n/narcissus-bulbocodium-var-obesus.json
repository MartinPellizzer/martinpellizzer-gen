    "intro": "Narcissus bulbocodium var. obesus, commonly known as the fat bulb narcissus, is a variant of the genus Narcissus native to southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its compact, bulbous form and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The variety 'obesus' is distinguished by its swollen, fleshy bulbs, which contribute to its common name."
