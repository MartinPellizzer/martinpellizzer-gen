    "intro": "Neooreophilus rotundus, commonly known as the roundleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in dense forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
