It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, dark green leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
