    "intro": "Neuontobotrys berningeri, commonly known as the Berninger's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its flowers are highly specialized, often featuring intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuontobotrys berningeri is considered a critically endangered species."
