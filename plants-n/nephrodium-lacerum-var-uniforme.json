It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome that supports its growth habit. Its leaves are often described as having a lacerated appearance due to their finely divided margins. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded environments."
