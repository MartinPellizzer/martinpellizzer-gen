    "intro": "Nephrodium bermudianum, commonly known as the Bermuda kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Bermuda. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
