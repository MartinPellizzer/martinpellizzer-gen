    "intro": "Neottia minor, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, small, pale green or white flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has a complex root system that includes mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Neottia minor is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
