The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Nicotiana salina is also used in scientific research for its genetic traits and potential medicinal applications."
