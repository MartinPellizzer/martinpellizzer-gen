    "intro": "Nardurus tenellus subsp. aristatus, commonly known as the slender nardus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
