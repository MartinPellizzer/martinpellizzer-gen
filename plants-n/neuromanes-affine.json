    "intro": "Neuromanes affine, commonly known as the smooth neuromane, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodland or grassland habitats."
