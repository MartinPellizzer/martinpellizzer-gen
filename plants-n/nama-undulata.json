    "intro": "Nama undulata, commonly known as the mountain sour fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Nama undulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
