    "intro": "Notholaena trichomanoides, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb sufficient humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
