It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, Nitrosalsola is now considered an endangered species."
