    "intro": "Nepeta arragonensis, commonly known as the Spanish catmint, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. Nepeta arragonensis is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
