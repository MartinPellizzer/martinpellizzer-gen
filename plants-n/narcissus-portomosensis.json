    "intro": "Narcissus portomosensis, commonly known as the Portomos daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Portomos in the Aegean Sea. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
