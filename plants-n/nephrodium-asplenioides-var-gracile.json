    "intro": "Nephrodium asplenioides var. gracile, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates in water. The fronds are usually light green and exhibit a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
