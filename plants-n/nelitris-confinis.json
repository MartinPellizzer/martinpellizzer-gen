    "intro": "Nelitris confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nelitris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Nelitris confinis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
