    "intro": "Nunnezharia pacaya, commonly known as the Pacaya orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid conditions."
