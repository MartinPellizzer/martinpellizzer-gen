It is characterized by its striking red petals that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of large trees. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Neltuma rubriflora plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
