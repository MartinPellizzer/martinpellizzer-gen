The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. Its leaves are narrow and whorled, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in water. Najas indica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
