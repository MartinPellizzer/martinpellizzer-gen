    "intro": "Navaea phoenicea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, palm-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and tropical environments, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
