    "intro": "Needhamia pumilio var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's rock orchid, is a rare and small terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, stout rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
