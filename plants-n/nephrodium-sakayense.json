    "intro": "Nephrodium sakayense, commonly known as the Sakay fern, is a rare tropical fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like young fronds. The plant has compound leaves with a unique arrangement of pinnae, which are often curved and spirally arranged. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
