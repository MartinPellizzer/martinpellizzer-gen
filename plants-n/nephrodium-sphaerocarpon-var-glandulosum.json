    "intro": "Nephrodium sphaerocarpon var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular sphaerocarpon, is a rare and specialized fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, fleshy, and glandular leaves that are often covered in small, sticky structures. The plant exhibits a distinctive reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
