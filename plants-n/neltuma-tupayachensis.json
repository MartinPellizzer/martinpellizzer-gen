    "intro": "Neltuma tupayachensis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs that help reduce water loss. Neltuma tupayachensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance among local communities."
