    "intro": "Nesogordonia dewevrei, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a large, slow-growing tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its straight trunk, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters, and its pinnate leaves that can extend over 5 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fruits, each containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, oily pulp. It is an important species for both ecological and economic reasons, particularly in the production of palm oil. However, its natural habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and land conversion."
