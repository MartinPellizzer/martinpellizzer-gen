    "intro": "Neooreophilus phalicus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent leaves. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its specialized leaves, which are adapted for aerial growth. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, are highly fragrant and bloom during the dry season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Neooreophilus phalicus is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
