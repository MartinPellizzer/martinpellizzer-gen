    "intro": "Neoporteria recondita var. residua, commonly known as the rare mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
