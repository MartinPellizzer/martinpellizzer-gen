The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to ponds and lakes. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Nymphoides rautanenii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
