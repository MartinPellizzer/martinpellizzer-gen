    "intro": "Noccaea minima, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. Noccaea minima is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing shorelines and improving water quality."
