    "intro": "Nephthytis picturata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed snake plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial native to Central America. It features narrow, upright leaves that are dark green with prominent white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, though this is less common in cultivated settings. The variegation in its leaves makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
