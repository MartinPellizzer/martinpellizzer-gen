    "intro": "Neomammillaria hamiltonhoytiae, commonly known as the Hamilton Hoyt cactus, is a small, slow-growing species native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white to pale yellow areoles and spines. The flowers are typically pale yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. This cactus requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
