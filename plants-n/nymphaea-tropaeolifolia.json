    "intro": "Nymphaea tropaeolifolia, commonly known as the tropical water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often opening in the early morning. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes allow it to spread across water surfaces. Nymphaea tropaeolifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
