    "intro": "Nitrophila australis var. kunzei, commonly known as the Australian nitrophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh climates."
