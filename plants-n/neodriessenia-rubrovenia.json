It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking contrast of green and red veins. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
