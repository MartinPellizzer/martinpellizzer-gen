    "intro": "Neoporteria curvispina var. echinus, commonly known as the spiny neoporteria, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the winter months. Its unique characteristic is the presence of spiny bracts beneath the flowers, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
