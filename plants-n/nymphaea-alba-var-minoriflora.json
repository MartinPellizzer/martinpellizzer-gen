    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. minoriflora, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves and produces delicate white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems support the foliage. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
