    "intro": "Neoregelia aculeatosepala, commonly known as the spiked-lobed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that are adorned with sharp, spiky projections along their margins. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, which is essential for survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Neoregelia aculeatosepala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
