    "intro": "Neophloga oligostachya, commonly known as the slender flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Neophloga oligostachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
