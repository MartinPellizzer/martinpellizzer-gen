    "intro": "Notopora auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears plant, is a unique species native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling droplets of water, hence its common name. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Due to its restricted range and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
