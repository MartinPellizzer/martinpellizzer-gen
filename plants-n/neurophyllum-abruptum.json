    "intro": "Neurophyllum abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt mountainflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet-blue petals that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
