    "intro": "Nothofagus uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp myrtle, is a species of evergreen tree native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dark, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy on top and hairy underneath. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested wetlands and peat bogs. Its cones are small and contain edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Nothofagus uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its habitat."
