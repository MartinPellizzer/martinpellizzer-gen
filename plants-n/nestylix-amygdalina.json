    "intro": "Nestylix amygdalina, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain bitter almond seeds, which are toxic due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid. Its root system is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it distinct within its family, with adaptations suited to its native environment."
