    "intro": "Nicotiana pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a small annual herb native to South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, featuring hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is closely related to tobacco species and contains nicotine, though in lower concentrations compared to its larger relatives. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
