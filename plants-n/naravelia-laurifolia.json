    "intro": "[WRONG START] Narvelia laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel-leafed narvelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that resemble those of laurel trees, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
