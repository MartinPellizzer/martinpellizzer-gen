    "intro": "Norantea uleana, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray leaves and clusters of delicate, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, an adaptation to its native climate. Norantea uleana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
