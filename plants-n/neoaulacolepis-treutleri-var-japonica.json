    "intro": "Neoaulacolepis treutleri var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
