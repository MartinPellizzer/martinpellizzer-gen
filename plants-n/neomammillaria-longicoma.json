    "intro": "Neomammillaria longicoma, commonly known as the long-spined milk barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spines are long and often curved, providing protection from herbivores. Neomammillaria longicoma is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems."
