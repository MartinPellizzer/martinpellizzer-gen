    "intro": "Narcissus cantabricus subsp. monophyllus, commonly known as the Cantabrian daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the northern Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with a white throat. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
