    "intro": "Nageia andina, commonly known as the Andean nageia, is a species of conifer native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and conical shape, typical of many coniferous trees. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Nageia andina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
