    "intro": "Neobartsia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Neobartsia pauciflora is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
