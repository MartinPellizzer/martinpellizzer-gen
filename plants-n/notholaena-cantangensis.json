    "intro": "Notholaena cantangensis, commonly known as the Cantung fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus Notholaena. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth at higher altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notholaena cantangensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
