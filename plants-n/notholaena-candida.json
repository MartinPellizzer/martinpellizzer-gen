    "intro": "Notholaena candida, commonly known as the white leaching fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green to white hue, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
