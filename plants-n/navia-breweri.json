    "intro": "Navia breweri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Navia breweri is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
