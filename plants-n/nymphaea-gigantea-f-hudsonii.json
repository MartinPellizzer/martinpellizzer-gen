    "intro": "Nymphaea gigantea f. hudsonii, commonly known as the Hudson's giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a striking visual display on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to white in color, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the pond or lake bottom while its stems float on the water. This species is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
