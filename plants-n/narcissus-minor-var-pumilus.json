    "intro": "Narcissus minor var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a compact variety of the genus Narcissus. It is characterized by its small, rounded bulbs and early blooming habit, typically flowering in late winter to early spring. The plant produces one to three narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, small, cup-shaped flower with a yellow perianth. The flower's tepals are usually a pale yellow with a darker central stripe, and it is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
