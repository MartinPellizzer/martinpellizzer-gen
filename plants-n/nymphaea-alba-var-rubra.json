    "intro": "Nymphaea alba var. rubra, commonly known as the red water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface, contrasting with its broad, heart-shaped green leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically floating, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty."
