    "intro": "Nigella arvensis var. longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked cowplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a slightly hairy texture. The variety longicornis is characterized by its longer, more pronounced seed pods compared to the typical form of Nigella arvensis."
