    "intro": "Notopleura araguensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Notopleura araguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
