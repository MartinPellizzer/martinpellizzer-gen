    "intro": "Nisoralis, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that create a cascading effect, making it visually striking. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green with a slight yellowish hue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Nisoralis is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
