    "intro": "Notarisia securigera, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Notarisia securigera is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
