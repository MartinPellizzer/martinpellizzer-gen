It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world for its striking floral display."
