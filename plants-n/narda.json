    "intro": "Narda, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It typically features small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling dandelions. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Narda species are often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. They are known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
