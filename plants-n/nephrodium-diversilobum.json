    "intro": "Nephrodium diversilobum, commonly known as the California nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its feathery, pinnate fronds that are often divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The leaves are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
