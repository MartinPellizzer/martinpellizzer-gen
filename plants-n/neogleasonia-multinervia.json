It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. Neogleasonia multinervia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
