    "intro": "Nageia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty nageia, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen trunk and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
