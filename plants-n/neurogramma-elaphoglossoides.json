    "intro": "Neurogramma elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon fern in the wild."
