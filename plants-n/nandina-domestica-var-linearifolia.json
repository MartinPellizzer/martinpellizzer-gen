    "intro": "Nandina domestica var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf nandina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the more commonly cultivated varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping for its year-round visual interest."
