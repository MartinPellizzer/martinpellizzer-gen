    "intro": "Nephrodium proliferum, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Nephrodium proliferum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
