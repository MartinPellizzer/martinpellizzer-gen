The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central tube, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Neonauclea havilandii is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas."
