It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its hairy leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
