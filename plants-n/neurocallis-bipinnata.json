    "intro": "Neurocallis bipinnata, commonly known as the double-pinnate fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into multiple pairs of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. Neurocallis bipinnata is known for its seasonal variation in frond development, with new growth appearing in the spring and aging fronds turning brown and withering by late summer."
