    "intro": "Nephrodium marginale var. distans, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
