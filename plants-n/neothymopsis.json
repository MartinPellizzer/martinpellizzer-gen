    "intro": "Neothymopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with translucent, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Neothymopsis produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, and it is known for its difficulty in cultivation due to its specialized habitat requirements. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
