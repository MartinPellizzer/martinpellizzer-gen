    "intro": "Noccaea borealis, commonly known as the Arctic kidneyweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in tundra and high-altitude meadows. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lobed and arranged in a rosette pattern. Noccaea borealis has adapted to extreme conditions through its thick, waxy leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve moisture and withstand harsh winters. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
