    "intro": "Notocles indica, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Notocles indica is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its drought tolerance."
