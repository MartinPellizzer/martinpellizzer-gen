    "intro": "Nama undulata var. hispida, commonly known as the rough nama or hispid nama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Nama undulata var. hispida is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock."
