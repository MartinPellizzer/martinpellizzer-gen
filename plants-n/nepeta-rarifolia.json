    "intro": "Nepeta rarifolia, commonly known as the rare catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Nepeta rarifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
