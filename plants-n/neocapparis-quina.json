    "intro": "Neocapparis quina, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. Neocapparis quina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
