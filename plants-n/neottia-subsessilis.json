    "intro": "Neottia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, pale green or yellowish flower. It lacks true roots and instead relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Neottia subsessilis is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
