    "intro": "Nephrolepis imbricata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, glossy lobes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense foliage. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Nephrolepis imbricata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
