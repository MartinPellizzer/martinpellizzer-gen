    "intro": "Nasa asplundii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often found growing on trees or rocks. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat requirements and rarity, Nasa asplundii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
