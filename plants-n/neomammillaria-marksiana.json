    "intro": "Neomammillaria marksiana, commonly known as the Mark's Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Neomammillaria marksiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
