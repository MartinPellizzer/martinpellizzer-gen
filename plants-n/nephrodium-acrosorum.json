    "intro": "Nephrodium acrosorum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Nephrodium acrosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
