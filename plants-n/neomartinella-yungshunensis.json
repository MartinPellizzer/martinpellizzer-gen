    "intro": "Neomartinella yungshunensis, commonly known as the Yungshun alpine bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
