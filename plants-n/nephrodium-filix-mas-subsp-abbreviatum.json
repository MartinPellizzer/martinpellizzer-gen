    "intro": "Nephrodium filix-mas subsp. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like fronds that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with short, strobiliferous fronds that bear sporangia on the underside, facilitating spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on high humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
