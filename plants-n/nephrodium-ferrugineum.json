    "intro": "Nephrodium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant's fronds are typically dark green with a rusty-brown margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium ferrugineum is considered a vulnerable species."
