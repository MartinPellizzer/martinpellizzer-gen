    "intro": "Noronhia cameroonensis, commonly known as the Cameroon starling tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Cameroon and adjacent regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Noronhia cameroonensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests."
