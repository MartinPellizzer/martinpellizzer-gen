    "intro": "Neowerdermannia chilensis subsp. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude areas, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and often clustered, displaying shades of white, pink, or purple, and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
