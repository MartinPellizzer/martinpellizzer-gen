    "intro": "Nephrodium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a creeping rhizome that produces numerous upright, arching fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture and a dark green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's ability to form dense colonies makes it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
