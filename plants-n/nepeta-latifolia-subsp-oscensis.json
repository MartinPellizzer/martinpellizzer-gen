    "intro": "Nepeta latifolia subsp. oscensis, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves contain nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Nepeta genus, which includes several other cat-attracting plants."
