    "intro": "Nicotiana africana, commonly known as African tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is notable for its alkaloid content, similar to other members of the Nicotiana genus."
