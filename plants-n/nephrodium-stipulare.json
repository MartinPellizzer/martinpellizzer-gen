    "intro": "Nephrodium stipulare, commonly known as the stipule fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like stipules. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium stipulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
