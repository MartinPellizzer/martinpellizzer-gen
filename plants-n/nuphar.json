    "intro": "Nuphar, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Nuphar species typically have broad, rounded leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Their roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while the stems support the plant's structure. The flowers of Nuphar are often pink or white, and they play a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and beetles."
