    "intro": "Nuphar pumila subsp. spenneriana, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically above the water surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in ponds and lakes."
