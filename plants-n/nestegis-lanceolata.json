    "intro": "Nestegis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf nestegis, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal and dry inland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
