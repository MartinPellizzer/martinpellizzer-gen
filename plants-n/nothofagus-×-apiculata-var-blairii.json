    "intro": "Nothofagus \u00d7 apiculata var. blairii, commonly known as the Blair's Nothofagus, is a hybrid evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Nothofagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, woody fruits that are important for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate rainforests and is adapted to moist, shaded environments. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological traits that distinguish it from its parent species."
