    "intro": "Naravelia dasyoneura var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically borne on short lateral branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
