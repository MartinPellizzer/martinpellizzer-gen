    "intro": "Nyssa montana, commonly known as the mountain dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy white or pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its fruits are small, dark berries that persist through winter. Nyssa montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
