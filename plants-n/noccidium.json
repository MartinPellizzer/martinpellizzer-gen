    "intro": "Noccidium, commonly known as the golden seal, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, which have been used in traditional herbal medicine. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many areas."
