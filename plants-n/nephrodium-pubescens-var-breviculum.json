    "intro": "Nephrodium pubescens var. breviculum, commonly known as the short-stemmed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, lanceolate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where humidity is high. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
