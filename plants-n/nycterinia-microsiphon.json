    "intro": "Nycterinia microsiphon, commonly known as the small siphon orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Nycterinia microsiphon plays a role in pollination by attracting nocturnal insects such as moths and flies."
