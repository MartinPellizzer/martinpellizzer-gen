    "intro": "Nepenthes insignis, commonly known as the giant tawny pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's unique structure includes a slippery inner surface and a waxy rim that prevents prey from escaping. Nepenthes insignis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires nutrient-poor soil to flourish. Its striking yellow-orange coloration makes it a visually distinctive species within the Nepenthaceae family."
