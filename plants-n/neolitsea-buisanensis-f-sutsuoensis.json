It belongs to the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, where it forms dense undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinctively sweet scent when crushed. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
