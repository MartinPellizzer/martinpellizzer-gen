    "intro": "Nothopanax pinnatus, commonly known as the featherleaf syllepis, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
