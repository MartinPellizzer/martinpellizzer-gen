    "intro": "Nubelaria arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that form a compact rosette, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nubelaria arisanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
