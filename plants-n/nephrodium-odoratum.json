    "intro": "Nephrodium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant kidney fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy fronds that emit a mild, pleasant fragrance, especially when the plant is stressed or during the evening. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Nephrodium odoratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique aromatic qualities."
