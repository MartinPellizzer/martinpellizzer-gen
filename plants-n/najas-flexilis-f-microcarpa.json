It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces tiny, elongated fruits that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology is adapted for aquatic life, with structures that facilitate buoyancy and photosynthesis in water."
