It is a small, slow-growing cactus with a globular shape and typically measures up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features prominent, rib-like structures that are slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from areoles along the stems. Neomammillaria compressa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
