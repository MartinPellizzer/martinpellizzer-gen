It belongs to the Bombacaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The tree produces a fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer that encases a hard seed. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties, while the fruit is a source of dietary fiber and oil. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is valued for its economic contributions."
