    "intro": "Nengella yulensis, commonly known as the Yulensian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Yulensian Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat, Nengella yulensis is considered an endangered species."
