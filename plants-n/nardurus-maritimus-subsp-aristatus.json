    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus subsp. aristatus, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
