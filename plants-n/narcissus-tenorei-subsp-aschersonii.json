    "intro": "Narcissus tenorei subsp. aschersonii, commonly known as the Ascherson's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, linear leaves and a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
