    "intro": "Nephrodium rigidum var. germanicum, commonly known as the German staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern native to Europe. It is characterized by its large, leathery, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are found on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
