    "intro": "Nolina altamiranoana, commonly known as the Altamirano's nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a low-maintenance plant for arid landscapes."
