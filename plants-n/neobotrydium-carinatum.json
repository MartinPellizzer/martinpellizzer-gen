    "intro": "Neobotrydium carinatum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Neobotrydium carinatum is adapted to cold, humid climates and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
