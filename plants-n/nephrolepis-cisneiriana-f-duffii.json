    "intro": "Nephrolepis cisneiriana f. duffii, commonly known as the Duff's shield fern, is a varietal form of the common shield fern. It is a tropical fern characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
