    "intro": "Neara longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf neara, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Neara longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along riverbanks."
