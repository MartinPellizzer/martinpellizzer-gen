    "intro": "Nephrodium cicutarium var. dubium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. This variant is notable for its adaptability and ecological importance in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
