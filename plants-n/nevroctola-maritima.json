    "intro": "Nevroctola maritima, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in brackish or freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may extend into the air to support the floral structures. Nevroctola maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
