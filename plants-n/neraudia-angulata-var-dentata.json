    "intro": "Neraudia angulata var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated neraudia, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-white or pale yellow hues. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
