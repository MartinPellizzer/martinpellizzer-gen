    "intro": "Nicotiana frutescens, commonly known as the shrubby tobacco plant, is a species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, and it is known for its mild nicotine content compared to other tobacco species. Nicotiana frutescens is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
