    "intro": "Nephrodium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely clustered, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Nephrodium puberulum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
