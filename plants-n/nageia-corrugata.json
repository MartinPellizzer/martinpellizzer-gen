    "intro": "Nageia corrugata, commonly known as the zigzag cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
