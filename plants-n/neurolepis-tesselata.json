    "intro": "Neurolepis tesselata, commonly known as the stonecress, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, small leaves arranged in a rosette, and clusters of bright yellow flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Neurolepis tesselata is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh climates."
