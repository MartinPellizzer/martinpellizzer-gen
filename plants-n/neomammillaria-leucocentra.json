    "intro": "Neomammillaria leucocentra, commonly known as the white-centred mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
