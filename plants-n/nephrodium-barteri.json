    "intro": "Nephrodium barteri, commonly known as the Barter's nephrolepis, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bi-pinnate. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces upright, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Nephrodium barteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
