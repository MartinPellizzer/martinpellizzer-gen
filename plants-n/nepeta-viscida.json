    "intro": "Nepeta viscida, commonly known as sticky catmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces sticky resinous secretions on its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Nepeta viscida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
