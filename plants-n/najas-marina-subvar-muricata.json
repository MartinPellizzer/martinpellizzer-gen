    "intro": "Najas marina subvar. muricata, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, and its rhizomes form dense underwater mats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can also become invasive in certain water bodies, altering local biodiversity."
