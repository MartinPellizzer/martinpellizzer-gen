    "intro": "Nephrodium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often divided into lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
