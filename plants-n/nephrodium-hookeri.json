    "intro": "Nephrodium hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's nephrolepis, is a fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Nephrodium hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
