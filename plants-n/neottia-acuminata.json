    "intro": "Neottia acuminata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and dense, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated spike of small, white or pale green flowers, which are often fragrant. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia acuminata is known for its mycorrhizal association, which is essential for its nutrient uptake and growth."
