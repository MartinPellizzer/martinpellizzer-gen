    "intro": "Nettoa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are typically thin and papery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Nettoa lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its rhizomes, which are specialized for anchoring and nutrient uptake. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
