    "intro": "Neillia affinis var. polygyna, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is known for its hardy nature and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
