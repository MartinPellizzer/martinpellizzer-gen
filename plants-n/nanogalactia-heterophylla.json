    "intro": "Nanogalactia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf legume, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant exhibits a distinctive variation in leaf shape, which contributes to its common name. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by pods that contain edible seeds, making it both ecologically and potentially agriculturally significant."
