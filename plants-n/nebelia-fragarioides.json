    "intro": "Nebelia fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that allow it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated as an ornamental ground cover. Nebelia fragarioides is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
