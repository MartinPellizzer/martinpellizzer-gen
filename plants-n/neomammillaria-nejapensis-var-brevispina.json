    "intro": "Neomammillaria nejapensis var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined sunburst cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is adorned with short, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
