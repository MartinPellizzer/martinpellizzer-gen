It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Nymphaea baumii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various regions."
