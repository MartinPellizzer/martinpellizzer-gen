    "intro": "Niphobolus polydactylos, commonly known as the many-fingered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are usually submerged or floating. It is known for its ability to capture small aquatic invertebrates, which it digests for nutrients. The species is often found in temperate regions and exhibits adaptations for aquatic environments."
