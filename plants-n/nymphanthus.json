    "intro": "Nymphanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. These plants are native to Asia and are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and float on the surface of water, while the flowers can be fully submerged or partially emergent. Nymphanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and cultural significance in various traditions. The plant's unique ability to thrive in aquatic environments makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
