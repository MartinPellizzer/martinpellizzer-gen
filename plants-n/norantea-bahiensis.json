    "intro": "Norantea bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals and is typically found in coastal dune environments. The plant has small, lanceolate leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. It blooms during the dry season, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Norantea bahiensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
