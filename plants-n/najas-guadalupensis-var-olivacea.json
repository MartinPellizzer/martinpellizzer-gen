    "intro": "Najas guadalupensis var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems if not managed properly."
