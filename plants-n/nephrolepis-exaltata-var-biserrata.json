    "intro": "Nephrolepis exaltata var. biserrata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce new shoots and roots. The fronds are typically dark green and have a serrated edge, which distinguishes it from other varieties of nephrolepis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
