    "intro": "Neomammillaria pseudoperbella, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its pale stems. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
