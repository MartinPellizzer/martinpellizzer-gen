    "intro": "Nopalea brittonii var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated Britton's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and display a distinctive variegated leaf-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spine-like structures, and the stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
