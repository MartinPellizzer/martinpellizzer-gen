    "intro": "Nordmannia, commonly known as the Caucasian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nordmannia thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
