    "intro": "Neorhine pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Neorhine pillansii is considered critically endangered."
