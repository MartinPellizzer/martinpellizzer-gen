    "intro": "Nepeta cataria, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its leaves and flowers contain volatile oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its characteristic effect on cats. Nepeta cataria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
