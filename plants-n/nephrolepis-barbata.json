    "intro": "Nephrolepis barbata, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures along the midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Nephrolepis barbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
