    "intro": "Narthex silphium, commonly known as the silphium plant, is a now-extinct species that was once native to the region of ancient Greece and the eastern Mediterranean. It was a tall, herbaceous plant with large, umbrella-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloomed in the summer. The plant was highly valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its use as an abortifacient and contraceptive. Its rhizomes were also used in cooking and as a flavoring agent. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it became extinct by the 5th century CE."
