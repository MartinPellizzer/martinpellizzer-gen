    "intro": "Nervilia prainiana, commonly known as the Prain's fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
