    "intro": "Nephrolepis punctulata, commonly known as the dot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in small, scattered dots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous aerial roots, allowing it to spread easily. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
