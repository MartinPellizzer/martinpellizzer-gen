    "intro": "Neo-senaea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers and fleshy, thick leaves. The plants typically have a rosette growth habit, with leaves arranged in a circular pattern around the stem. Neo-senaea species are popular as ornamental plants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care. They require bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
