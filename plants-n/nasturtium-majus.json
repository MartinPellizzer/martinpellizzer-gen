    "intro": "Nasturtium majus, commonly known as the common nasturtium, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Tropaeolaceae. It is native to South America but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and vibrant, edible flowers in shades of orange and yellow. Its stems are hairy and can grow up to 1 to 2 meters in height. Nasturtium majus is known for its peppery taste, which comes from the presence of glucosinolates in its leaves and flowers."
