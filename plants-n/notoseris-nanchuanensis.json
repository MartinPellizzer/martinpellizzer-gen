It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy white seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
