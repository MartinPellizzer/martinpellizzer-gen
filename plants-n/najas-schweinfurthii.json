It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically ribbon-like and arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by distinctive, spirally arranged fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important component of aquatic ecosystems in its native range."
