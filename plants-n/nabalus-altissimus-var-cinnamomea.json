    "intro": "Nabalus altissimus var. cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-brown fertile frond at the end. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in providing habitat for various forest organisms."
