    "intro": "Nania tremuloides, commonly known as the trembling nania, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the early summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Nania tremuloides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
