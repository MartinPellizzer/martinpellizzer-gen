    "intro": "Nepenthes decurrens, commonly known as the drooping nepenthes, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its long, drooping tendrils and pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers are often green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of rainfall. Nepenthes decurrens is notable for its ability to trap and digest insects, making it an effective predator in its natural habitat."
