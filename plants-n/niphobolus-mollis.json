    "intro": "Niphobolus mollis, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, with distinctive spurred petals. Niphobolus mollis is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting aquatic invertebrates."
