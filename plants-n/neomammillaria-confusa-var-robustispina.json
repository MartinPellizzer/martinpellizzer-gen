It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
