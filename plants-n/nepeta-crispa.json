    "intro": "Nepeta crispa, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features square, erect stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. Nepeta crispa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
