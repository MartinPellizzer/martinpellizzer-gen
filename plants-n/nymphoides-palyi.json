    "intro": "Nymphoides palyi, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom during the day, often in clusters. Nymphoides palyi thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while its leaves and flowers remain buoyant on the water's surface."
