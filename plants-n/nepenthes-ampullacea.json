    "intro": "Nepenthes ampullacea, commonly known as the \"bottle-shaped pitcher plant,\" is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, bottle-shaped pitchers that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, while the lower portion is a narrow, tubular structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its specialized morphology allows it to efficiently capture prey in nutrient-poor habitats."
