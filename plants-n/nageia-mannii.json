    "intro": "Nageia mannii, commonly known as the Philippine cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Nageia mannii is adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
