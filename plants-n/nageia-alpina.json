    "intro": "Nageia alpina, commonly known as the alpine nageia, is a rare coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, feather-like foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and typically mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia alpina is considered a vulnerable species."
