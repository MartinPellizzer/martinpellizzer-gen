It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. Nageia comptonii is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests."
