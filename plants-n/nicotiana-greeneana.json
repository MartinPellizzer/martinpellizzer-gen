    "intro": "Nicotiana greeneana, commonly known as Greene's tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
