    "intro": "Nephrodium strigilosum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Nephrodium strigilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
