    "intro": "Neobotrydium ornithopodum, commonly known as the bird-footed fern, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the foot of a bird. The plant exhibits a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neobotrydium ornithopodum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
