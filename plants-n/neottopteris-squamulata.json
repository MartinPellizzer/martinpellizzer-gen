    "intro": "Neottopteris squamulata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Neottopteris squamulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
