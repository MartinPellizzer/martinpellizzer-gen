It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces tiny, nutmeg-like seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
