    "intro": "Nephrodium parallelogrammum var. khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
