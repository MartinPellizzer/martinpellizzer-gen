    "intro": "Nuphar lutea subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a water plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its large, floating yellow flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds."
