    "intro": "Neomammillaria centricirrha var. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri's clustered mammillaria, is a rare and unique cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
