    "intro": "Neurocallis pinnata, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns from green to red as it matures. The tree is valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a host plant for silkworms."
