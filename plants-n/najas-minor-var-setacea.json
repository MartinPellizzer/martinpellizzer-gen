    "intro": "Najas minor var. setacea, commonly known as the slender water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its dense growth, it can provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and young fish."
