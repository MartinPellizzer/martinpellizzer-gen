    "intro": "Notholaena sinuata var. integerrima, commonly known as the smooth fringed fern, is a variant of the fringed fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in small, rounded teeth along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while spreading vegetatively. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded garden settings."
