    "intro": "Nephrodium hudsonianum, commonly known as the Hudson's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Nephrodium hudsonianum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
