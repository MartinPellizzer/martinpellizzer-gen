    "intro": "Notoceras quadricorne, commonly known as the four-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes four prominent, elongated petals that resemble horns. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notoceras quadricorne is considered a vulnerable species."
