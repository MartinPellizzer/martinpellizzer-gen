    "intro": "Neustanthus sericans, commonly known as the floating water plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its buoyant leaves that allow it to float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Neustanthus sericans is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
