    "intro": "Neoporteria setosiflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bristly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It grows primarily on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant features small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This variant is notable for its bristly appearance, with hairy structures on its stems and leaves."
