    "intro": "Neochilenia aspillagae, commonly known as the Chilean rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its compact, drought-resistant growth form, which allows it to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a common trait among ferns. Neochilenia aspillagae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying adaptations to extreme climates."
