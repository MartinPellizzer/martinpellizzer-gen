    "intro": "Nissolia robiniifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf nissolia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are broadly elliptical and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Nissolia robiniifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
