    "intro": "Niederleinia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved niederleinia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, needle-like leaves that give it a unique, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Niederleinia microphylla is considered a species of conservation concern."
