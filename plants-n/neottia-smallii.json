    "intro": "Neottia smallii, commonly known as the smallii's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinct lip. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this species thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, often growing on trees or rocks, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
