    "intro": "Notocactus neo-ottoianus var. tenuispinus, commonly known as the slender spine cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in short, sparse spines, giving it a distinctive, low-profile appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the axils of the areoles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
