    "intro": "Nepeta leucophylla, commonly known as white catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Nepeta leucophylla is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
