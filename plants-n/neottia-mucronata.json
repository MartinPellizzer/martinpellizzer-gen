    "intro": "Neottia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories."
