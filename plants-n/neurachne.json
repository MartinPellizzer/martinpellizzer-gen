    "intro": "Neurachne, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Neurachne is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a rare and specialized flora species within its ecosystem."
