    "intro": "Nephrodium loherianum, commonly known as the Loherian kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Nephrodium loherianum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
