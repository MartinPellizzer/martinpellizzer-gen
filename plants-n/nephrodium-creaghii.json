    "intro": "Nephrodium creaghii, commonly known as the creagh's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Nephrodium creaghii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
