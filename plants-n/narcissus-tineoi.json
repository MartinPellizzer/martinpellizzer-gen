    "intro": "Narcissus tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo narcissus, is a rare and endangered species of daffodil native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, narrow, yellow flower with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
