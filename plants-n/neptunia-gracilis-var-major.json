    "intro": "Neptunia gracilis var. major, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender, floating leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, aiding in its ability to capture sunlight. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates and absorbing nutrients from the water. Neptunia gracilis var. major plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
