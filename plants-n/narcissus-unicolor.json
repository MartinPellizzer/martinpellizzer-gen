    "intro": "Narcissus unicolor, commonly known as the white narcissus, is a species of daffodil native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its single, white flower with a yellow corona, which distinguishes it from other narcissus varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
