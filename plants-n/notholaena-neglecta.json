    "intro": "Notholaena neglecta, commonly known as the neglected fern, is a small, low-growing fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often less than a foot in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Notholaena neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
