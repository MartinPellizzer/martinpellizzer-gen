    "intro": "Neostenanthera myristicifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
