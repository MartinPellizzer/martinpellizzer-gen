It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Neurachne montana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
