    "intro": "Neottia adnata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, hairy stem and produces a dense spike of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
