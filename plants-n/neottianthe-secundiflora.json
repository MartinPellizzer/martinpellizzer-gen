    "intro": "Neottianthe secundiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting yellow or green base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Neottianthe secundiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
