    "intro": "Nageia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved nageia, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The leaves are needle-like, sharp at the tip, and arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland to montane forests."
