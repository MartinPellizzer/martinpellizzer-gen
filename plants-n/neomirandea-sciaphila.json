    "intro": "Neomirandea sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the understory of tropical forests. It thrives in low-light conditions, making it a unique example of a plant adapted to shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to retain moisture in humid, forested areas. Due to habitat loss, Neomirandea sciaphila is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
