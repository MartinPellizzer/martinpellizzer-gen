    "intro": "Nicotiana acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its leaves are elongated and sessile, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters at the top of the plant, making it a visually striking species in its native environment."
