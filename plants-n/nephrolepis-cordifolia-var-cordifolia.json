    "intro": "Nephrolepis cordifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive heart-shaped outline, which give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense, lush foliage. Its fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a feathery texture that adds a refined appearance to indoor spaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
