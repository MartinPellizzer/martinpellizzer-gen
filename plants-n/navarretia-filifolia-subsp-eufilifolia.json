    "intro": "Navarretia filifolia subsp. eufilifolia, commonly known as the coastal filifoliate navarretia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
