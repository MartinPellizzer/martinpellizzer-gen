It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and recreational activities."
