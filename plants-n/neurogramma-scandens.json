    "intro": "Neurogramma scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and long, flexible stems that allow it to climb. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive bipinnate structure, and they are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Neurogramma scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
