    "intro": "Neslia, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed Mary,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or violet flowers that resemble those of the common Mary. They typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Neslia species are herbaceous perennials, with some varieties being annuals, and they have hairy stems and leaves. The flowers are usually arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
