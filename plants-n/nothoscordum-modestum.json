    "intro": "Nothoscordum modestum, commonly known as the small onion or wild leek, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor. Nothoscordum modestum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
