It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Negretia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its bold and dramatic appearance. However, it is also considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
