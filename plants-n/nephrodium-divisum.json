    "intro": "Nephrodium divisum, commonly known as the divided nephroid, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, divided leaves that resemble the shape of a kidney. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can receive ample sunlight for photosynthesis. The plant's leaves are usually a vibrant green, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of tiny, floating fruits. Nephrodium divisum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
