    "intro": "Nardosmia nivalis, commonly known as the snow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Nardosmia nivalis plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing early-season nectar for pollinators."
