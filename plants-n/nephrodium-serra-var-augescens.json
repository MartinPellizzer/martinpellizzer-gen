    "intro": "Nephrodium serra var. augescens, commonly known as the serrated kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into compound leaves with a kidney-shaped base. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. The varietal name 'augescens' refers to its tendency to grow taller and more robust compared to the typical form."
