    "intro": "Notodanthonia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
