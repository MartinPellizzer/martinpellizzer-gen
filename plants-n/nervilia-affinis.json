    "intro": "Nervilia affinis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees or in shaded, moist environments, often without soil. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and water, making it an epiphytic species. The botanical study of Nervilia affinis is important for understanding its unique adaptations and conservation needs in its natural habitat."
