    "intro": "Nassella ibarrensis, commonly known as the Ibarren needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
