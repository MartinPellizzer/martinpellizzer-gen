    "intro": "Neottia bicolor, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its striking white and green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Neottia bicolor has a complex root system and produces a unique type of mycorrhizal association that aids in nutrient absorption."
