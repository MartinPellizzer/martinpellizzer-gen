    "intro": "Neurogramma marginata, commonly known as the marginate neurogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive marginal stripe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Neurogramma marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
