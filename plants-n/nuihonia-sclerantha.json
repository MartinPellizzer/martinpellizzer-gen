It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, often tubular, flowers. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a distinctive textured surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
