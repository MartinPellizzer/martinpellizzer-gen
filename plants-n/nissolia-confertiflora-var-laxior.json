    "intro": "Nissolia confertiflora var. laxior, commonly known as the loose-flowered nissolia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, showy inflorescences that produce small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The varietal form 'laxior' distinguishes it by its more open and loosely arranged flower clusters compared to the typical species."
