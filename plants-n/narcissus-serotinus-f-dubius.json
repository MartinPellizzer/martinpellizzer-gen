    "intro": "Narcissus serotinus f. dubius, commonly known as the late-flowering daffodil, is a botanical variant of the genus Narcissus. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and a single, large, trumpet-shaped flower that blooms later in the spring compared to other daffodil species. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a sturdy stem that supports its showy yellow petals. Its flowers are often more elongated and have a more pronounced corona than the typical daffodil. This form is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and late blooming habit, making it a valuable addition to gardens and floral arrangements."
