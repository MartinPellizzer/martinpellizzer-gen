    "intro": "Nectandra riedelii var. longipaniculata, commonly known as the long panicle nectandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in long, pendulous panicles. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which emit a strong, resinous scent, and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its wood is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
