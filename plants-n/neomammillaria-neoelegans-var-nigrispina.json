    "intro": "Neomammillaria neoelegans var. nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a smooth, pale green body with dark, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
