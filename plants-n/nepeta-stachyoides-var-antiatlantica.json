    "intro": "Nepeta stachyoides var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic catmint, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves emit a minty scent when crushed, which is characteristic of the Nepeta genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes."
