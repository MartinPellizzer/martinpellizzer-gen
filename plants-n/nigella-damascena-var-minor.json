    "intro": "Nigella damascena var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cumin or Persian cumin, is a flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. This variety is closely related to the more commonly cultivated Nigella damascena, but it is generally smaller in stature and has a more delicate appearance."
