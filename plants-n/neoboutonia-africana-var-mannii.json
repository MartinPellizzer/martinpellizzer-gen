    "intro": "Neoboutonia africana var. mannii, commonly known as the African bamboo or African reed, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It forms dense clumps and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
