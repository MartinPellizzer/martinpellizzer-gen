    "intro": "Neohallia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky flower heads and salt-tolerant properties, making them adapted to coastal environments. Neohallia species typically have silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid or saline conditions. They produce small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus is native to various regions around the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
