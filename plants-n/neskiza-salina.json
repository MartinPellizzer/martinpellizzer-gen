    "intro": "Neskiza salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It possesses thick, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce water loss. The plant's small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Neskiza salina is native to arid and coastal regions where it thrives in salty soils. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
