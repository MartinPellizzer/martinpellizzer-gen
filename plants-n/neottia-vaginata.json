    "intro": "Neottia vaginata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, often leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive hood-like structure over the lip. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in association with other orchids in its habitat."
