    "intro": "Nephrodium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, round-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium rotundatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
