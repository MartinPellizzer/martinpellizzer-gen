    "intro": "Nuphar japonica var. crenata, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features broad, floating leaves with a distinctive wavy or scalloped edge, which is characteristic of the 'crenata' variety. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water bodies, forming dense colonies. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a habitat and food source for aquatic organisms."
