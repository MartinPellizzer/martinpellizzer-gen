    "intro": "Nymphaea \u00d7 marliacea var. chromatella, commonly known as the rainbow water lily, is a hybrid water lily species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful, showy flowers that range from white to pink, red, and even purple, often displaying multiple hues in a single bloom. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are broad, floating, and often have a waxy surface, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the pond substrate. The botanical interest of this variety lies in its vibrant floral displays and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
