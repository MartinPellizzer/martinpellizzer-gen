It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
