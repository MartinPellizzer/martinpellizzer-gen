    "intro": "Nephrolepis millsii, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features feathery, arching fronds that are typically 1 to 3 feet long, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid environments and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, lush clumps over time. Nephrolepis millsii is valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions with proper care."
