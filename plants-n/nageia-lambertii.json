    "intro": "Nageia lambertii, commonly known as the Lambert's nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a distinctive cone structure. The plant is classified as a gymnosperm, meaning it produces seeds without fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, Nageia lambertii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
