    "intro": "Nototriche castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's nototriche, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
