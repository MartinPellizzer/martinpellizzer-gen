    "intro": "Neottia kuanshanensis, commonly known as the Kuanshan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
