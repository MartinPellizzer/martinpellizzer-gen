    "intro": "Nervilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a unique structure, with a single, leafless stem that supports its flowers and a network of roots that help it absorb moisture from the boggy environment. Nervilia is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
