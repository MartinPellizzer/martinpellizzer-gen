    "intro": "Nephrodium dilatatum var. chanteriae, commonly known as the Chanter's nephrolepis, is a variant of the nephrolepis fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features long, slender, pinnately compound leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually bright green, with a slightly waxy texture, and the sori are arranged in lines along the undersides of the pinnae. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens or as a houseplant."
