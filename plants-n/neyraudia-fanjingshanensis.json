    "intro": "Neyraudia fanjingshanensis, commonly known as the Fanjingshan reed, is a rare grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
