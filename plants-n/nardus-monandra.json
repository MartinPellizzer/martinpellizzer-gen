    "intro": "Nardus monandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Nardus monandra is often found in coastal and inland desert areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
