It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, grayish bark. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, spherical pods containing seeds. Nothovernonia amblyolepis is adapted to saline and coastal conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
