    "intro": "Nervilia falcata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Nervilia falcata has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is an ephemeral plant, often dying back after flowering, but its rhizomes can persist for several years."
