    "intro": "Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp. abscissus, commonly known as the Abscissus daffodil, is a subspecies of the common daffodil characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, trumpet-shaped flower that is usually yellow in color. The flower's perianth is often more elongated compared to other daffodil varieties, and the tepals are usually longer than the tube. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to gardens and natural habitats."
