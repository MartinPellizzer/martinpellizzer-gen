    "intro": "Nivenia marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nivenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its root system helps it retain moisture, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in the soil. Nivenia marginata is often found in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to local biodiversity."
