    "intro": "Nymphaea ampla var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
