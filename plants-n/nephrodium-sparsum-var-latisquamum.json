    "intro": "Nephrodium sparsum var. latisquamum, commonly known as the broad-scale nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are broad and have a unique, scalloped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
