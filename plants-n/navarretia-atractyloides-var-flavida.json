    "intro": "Navarretia atractyloides var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has a basal rosette of linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
