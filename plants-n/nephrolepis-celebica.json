    "intro": "Nephrolepis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
