    "intro": "Nesopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae. Nesopteris grandis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
