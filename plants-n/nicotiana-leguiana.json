    "intro": "Nicotiana leguiana, commonly known as the Mexican tobacco plant, is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
