    "intro": "Narcissus segimonensis, commonly known as the Segimon narcissus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. This plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with six petals. The flower typically blooms in early spring, producing a delicate yellow hue with a distinct cup-like shape. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
