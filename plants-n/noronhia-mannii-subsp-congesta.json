    "intro": "Noronhia mannii subsp. congesta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
