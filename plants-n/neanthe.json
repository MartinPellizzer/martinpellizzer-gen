    "intro": "Neanthe, commonly known as the peace lily, is a tropical plant native to the understory of forests in Central and South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces white or pale green spatulate flowers that are not showy but are important for its reproductive cycle. Neanthe is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular houseplant. Its botanical name, Spathiphyllum, reflects the structure of its flowers, which resemble a spathe."
