    "intro": "Neolepisorus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like growth, which helps in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
