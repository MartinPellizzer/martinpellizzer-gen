    "intro": "Neoregelia macrosepala, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod bromeliad,\" is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with overlapping, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports microfauna. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Neoregelia macrosepala is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
