    "intro": "Nephrodium patulum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, supporting the growth of the fronds. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
