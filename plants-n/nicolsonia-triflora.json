    "intro": "Nicolsonia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered nicolsonia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
