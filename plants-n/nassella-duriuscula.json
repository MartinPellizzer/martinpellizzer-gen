    "intro": "Nassella duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, sharp, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Nassella duriuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
