    "intro": "Nassauvia scleranthoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Nassauvia scleranthoides is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
