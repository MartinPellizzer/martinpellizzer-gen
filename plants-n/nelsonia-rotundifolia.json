It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
