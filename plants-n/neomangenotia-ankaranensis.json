    "intro": "Neomangenotia ankaranensis, commonly known as the Ankaranensis mangenotia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforests of the eastern part of the island. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
