    "intro": "Narcissus ledroensis, commonly known as the Ledro narcissus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a yellow corona, which are typically 5 to 7 centimeters in diameter. The plant grows in alpine meadows at elevations between 1,800 and 2,400 meters, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, usually between May and June, and it is protected due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability. Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this unique botanical gem."
