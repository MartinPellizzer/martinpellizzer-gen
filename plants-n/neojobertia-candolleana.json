It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
