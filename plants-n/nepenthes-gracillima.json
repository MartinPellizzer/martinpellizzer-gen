    "intro": "Nepenthes gracillima, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pitchers that are typically green with a red or orange rim. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by digestive enzymes. Its habitat is typically shaded and humid, often growing in montane rainforests. Nepenthes gracillima is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
