    "intro": "Nycticalanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their striking, large white flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically fragrant and emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Nycticalanthus species are generally small shrubs with spiny stems and are adapted to arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their unique blooming habit and ornamental value."
