    "intro": "Notocactus incomptus, commonly known as the spiny cactus or the desert cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, branching cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Notocactus incomptus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
