    "intro": "Narcissus calcicarpetanus, commonly known as the limestone carpet narcissus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale-yellow flowers. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It is typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
