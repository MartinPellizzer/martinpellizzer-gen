    "intro": "Nama dichotoma subsp. eudichotoma, commonly known as the \"Nama grass,\" is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
