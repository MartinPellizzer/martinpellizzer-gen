    "intro": "Nepeta globifera, commonly known as the globe thyme or globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Nepeta globifera is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in rock gardens or alpine settings due to its drought tolerance. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
