    "intro": "Nephrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Nephrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
