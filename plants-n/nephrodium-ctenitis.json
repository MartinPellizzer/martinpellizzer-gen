    "intro": "Nephrodium ctenitis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into small, shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Nephrodium ctenitis is notable for its ornamental value and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
