    "intro": "Nymphozanthus orbiculatus, commonly known as the globe-shaped nymphaeaceae, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive round, floating leaves. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae, which includes water lilies and other aquatic flora. The plant typically features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to support the plant's buoyancy in water. Nymphozanthus orbiculatus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes."
