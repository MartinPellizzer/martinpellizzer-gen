It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers. The leaves are typically soft and hairy, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Nemophila. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
