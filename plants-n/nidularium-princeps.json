    "intro": "Nidularium princeps, commonly known as the royal basket plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which adds to its ornamental appeal. Nidularium princeps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
