    "intro": "Nuttallia triangulata, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular leaves and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing prey. This plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Nuttallia triangulata plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem and is often used in ecological studies."
