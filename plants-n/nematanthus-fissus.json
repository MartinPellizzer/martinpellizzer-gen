    "intro": "Nematanthus fissus, commonly known as the split-leaved winged vine, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its climbing habit and trailing stems make it suitable for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. The plant thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
