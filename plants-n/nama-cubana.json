    "intro": "Nama cubana, commonly known as Cuban sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. It is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and high temperatures. Nama cubana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
