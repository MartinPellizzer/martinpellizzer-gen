    "intro": "Nephrodium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
