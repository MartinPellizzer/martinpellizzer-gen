    "intro": "Nipa arborescens, commonly known as the mangrove nipa, is a halophytic shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in tidal mudflats and mangrove swamps. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion, while its aerial roots facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, edible fruits that are dispersed by water. Nipa arborescens plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
