    "intro": "Nephrodium monocarpum, commonly known as the single-seed kidney fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant produces a single, large, fertile frond that bears sporangia, which are responsible for spore production. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Nephrodium monocarpum is often found in humid, shaded environments in tropical regions."
