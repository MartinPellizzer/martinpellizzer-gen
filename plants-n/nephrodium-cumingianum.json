    "intro": "Nephrodium cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are adapted for water life. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate. Nephrodium cumingianum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
