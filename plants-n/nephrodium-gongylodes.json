    "intro": "Nephrodium gongylodes, commonly known as the Chinese fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the humid seasons. Nephrodium gongylodes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
