    "intro": "Nephrodium invisum, commonly known as the phantom fern, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often difficult to spot in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are concealed within the leaflets, contributing to its elusive nature. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Nephrodium invisum is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
