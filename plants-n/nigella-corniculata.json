    "intro": "Nigella corniculata, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers with long, slender petals that resemble horns. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open when mature, releasing its tiny, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Nigella corniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
