    "intro": "Neobaclea spirostegia, commonly known as the spiral-stemmed neobaclea, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along its slender, twisting stems, which give it a visually appealing and somewhat ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the subspecies. Neobaclea spirostegia is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens and as a specimen plant due to its unusual growth pattern."
