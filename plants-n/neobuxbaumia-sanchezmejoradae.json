    "intro": "Neobuxbaumia sanchezmejoradae, commonly known as the Sanchezm\u00e9jorada's ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Ocotonioideae and is characterized by its tall, woody stems and clusters of bright red flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Neobuxbaumia sanchezmejoradae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators such as birds and insects."
