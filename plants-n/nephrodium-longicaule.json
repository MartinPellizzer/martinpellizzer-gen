    "intro": "Nephrodium longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium longicaule is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
