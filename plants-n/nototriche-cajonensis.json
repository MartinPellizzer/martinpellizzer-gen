    "intro": "Nototriche cajonensis, commonly known as the Cajon Valley nototriche, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Nototriche cajonensis is often found in canyons and along streambeds, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
