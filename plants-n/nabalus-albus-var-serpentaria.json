    "intro": "Nabalus albus var. serpentaria, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, acidic flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
