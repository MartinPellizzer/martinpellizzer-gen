    "intro": "Nocca tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, followed by seed pods that mature into brown, woody capsules. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Nocca tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
