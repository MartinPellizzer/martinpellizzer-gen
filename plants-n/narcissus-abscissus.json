    "intro": "Narcissus abscissus, commonly known as the yellow daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its bulbs are relatively small and are used in ornamental gardening for their early spring blooms. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it one of the first daffodils to appear in the garden."
