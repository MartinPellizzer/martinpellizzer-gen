    "intro": "Nectandra davidsoniana, commonly known as Davidson's sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves, and it produces drupes that are dispersed by animals. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
