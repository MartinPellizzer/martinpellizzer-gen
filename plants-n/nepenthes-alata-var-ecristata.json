    "intro": "Nepenthes alata var. ecristata, commonly known as the winged pitcher plant, is a variant of the alata species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive winged structures on the pitcher's rim, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking, elongated pitchers that can hold up to 500 milliliters of liquid, used to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a dark green coloration. This variant is appreciated for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
