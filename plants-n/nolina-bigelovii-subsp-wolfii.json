    "intro": "Nolina bigelovii subsp. wolfii, commonly known as the desert spineflower, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spiny, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a low water requirement. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
