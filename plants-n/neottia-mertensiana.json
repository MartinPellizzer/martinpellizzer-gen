    "intro": "Neottia mertensiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many areas. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern."
