    "intro": "Nymphaea dictyophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Nymphaea dictyophlebia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
