    "intro": "Norysca lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf norysca, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in local herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Norysca lanceolata thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland borders."
