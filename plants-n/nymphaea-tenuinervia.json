    "intro": "Nymphaea tenuinervia, commonly known as the slender-veined water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open during the day. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its rhizomes spread horizontally. Nymphaea tenuinervia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
