    "intro": "Nepenthes pumila, commonly known as the miniature pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its small, delicate pitchers that are typically less than 5 centimeters in height. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and relies on insect prey for nutrients due to nutrient-poor soil conditions. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme to break down captured prey, which is then absorbed through the plant's vascular system. Despite its small size, Nepenthes pumila plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
