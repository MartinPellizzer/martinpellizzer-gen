    "intro": "Nigritella rhellicani subsp. gabasiana, commonly known as the Gabasian black orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
