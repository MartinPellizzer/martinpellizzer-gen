    "intro": "Numularia, commonly known as silver carpet or pennywort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that create a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Numularia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the year, making it a popular choice for shady garden spaces."
