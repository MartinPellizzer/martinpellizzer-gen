    "intro": "Narthecium ossifragum var. americanum, commonly known as the American wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its woodland habitat. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, cool environments and is often found in rich, undisturbed forest floors."
