    "intro": "Neobotrydium melanocarpum, commonly known as the black-fruited orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fruits that contrast with its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
