    "intro": "Nectandra fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with a distinct aromatic scent. Due to overharvesting, Nectandra fulva is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
