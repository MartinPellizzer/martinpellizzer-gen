    "intro": "Nesogordonia abrahamii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, although it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
