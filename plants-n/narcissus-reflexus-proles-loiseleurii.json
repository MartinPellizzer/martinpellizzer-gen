    "intro": "Narcissus reflexus proles loiseleurii, commonly known as the Loiseleur's double narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, double-flowered blooms that consist of two layers of petals, creating a more elaborate appearance than typical narcissus varieties. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms in early spring. This species is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
