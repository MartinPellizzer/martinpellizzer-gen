    "intro": "Nectandra diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense-making."
