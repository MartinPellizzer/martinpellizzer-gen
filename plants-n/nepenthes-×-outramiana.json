    "intro": "Nepenthes \u00d7 outramiana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant resulting from the crossbreeding of Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a distinctive red or orange hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to maintain its physiological functions. Its nectar-filled traps attract and digest insects, contributing to its role as a unique predator in the ecosystem. This hybrid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking appearance."
