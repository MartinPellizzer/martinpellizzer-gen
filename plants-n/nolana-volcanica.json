    "intro": "Nolana volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic nolana, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature essential for survival in its harsh habitat. Nolana volcanica is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
