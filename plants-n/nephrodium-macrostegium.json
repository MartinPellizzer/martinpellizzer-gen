    "intro": "Nephrodium macrostegium, commonly known as the large-stemmed nephroid, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fiddleheads that unfurl into lanceolate leaves. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a notable species in ecological studies."
