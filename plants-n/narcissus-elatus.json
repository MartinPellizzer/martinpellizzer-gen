    "intro": "Narcissus elatus, commonly known as the Persian daffodil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single stem bearing one or two flowers. Its bright yellow petals and white throat create a visually appealing contrast, making it a popular ornamental plant. Narcissus elatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates for optimal growth."
