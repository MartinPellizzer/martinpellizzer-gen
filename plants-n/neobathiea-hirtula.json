It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Neobathiea hirtula is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadside areas and open woodlands."
