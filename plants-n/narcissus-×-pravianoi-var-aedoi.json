    "intro": "Narcissus \u00d7 pravianoi var. aedoi, commonly known as the Aurelia daffodil, is a hybrid daffodil prized for its vibrant yellow petals and upright growth habit. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped corona, which is often longer than the petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201350 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens during the transition from winter to summer."
