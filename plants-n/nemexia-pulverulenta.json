    "intro": "Nemexia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dustplant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
