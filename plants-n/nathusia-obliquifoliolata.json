    "intro": "Nathusia obliquifoliolata, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is usually compact, making it suitable for container gardening. The leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat zigzagged edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
