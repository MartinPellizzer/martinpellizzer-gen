    "intro": "Neopectinaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, typically found on cliffs, stones, and soil in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
