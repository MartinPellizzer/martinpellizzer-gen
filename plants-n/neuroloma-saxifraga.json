    "intro": "Neuroloma saxifraga, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually white or pink. Neuroloma saxifraga plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
