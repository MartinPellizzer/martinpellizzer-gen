    "intro": "Nyctago parviflora, commonly known as the night-blooming starflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its blooming period is typically during the warmer months, and it relies on nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
