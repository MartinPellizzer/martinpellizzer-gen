    "intro": "Neolepisorus ovatus f. monstrosus, commonly known as the monstrous form of the ovate lepisorus, is a variant of a fern species native to the forests of Southeast Asia. This particular form is characterized by its unusually large, broad, and often distorted fronds, which give it a striking, almost otherworldly appearance. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a slightly curled or twisted texture that sets it apart from the standard variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. This unique form is highly sought after by collectors for its distinctive morphology and ornamental value."
