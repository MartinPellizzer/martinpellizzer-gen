    "intro": "Navicularia glabra, commonly known as the smooth navicularia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Navicularia glabra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture that contributes to its common name."
