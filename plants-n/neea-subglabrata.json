    "intro": "Neea subglabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf neea, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Neea subglabrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and undergrowth."
