It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 centimeters, with a compact growth habit. Its bulbs are adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The species is closely related to other daffodil species and is valued for its resilience and floral display."
