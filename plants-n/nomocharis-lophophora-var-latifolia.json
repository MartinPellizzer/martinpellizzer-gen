    "intro": "Nomocharis lophophora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lophophora, is a perennial cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for arid environments."
