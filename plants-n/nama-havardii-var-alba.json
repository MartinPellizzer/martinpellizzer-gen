    "intro": "Nama havardii var. alba, commonly known as the white nama or white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
