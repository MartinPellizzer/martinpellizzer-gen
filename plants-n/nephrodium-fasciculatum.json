    "intro": "Nephrodium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Nephrodium fasciculatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
