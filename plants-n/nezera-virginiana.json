    "intro": "Nezera virginiana, commonly known as the Virginia nezera, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Nezera virginiana is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
