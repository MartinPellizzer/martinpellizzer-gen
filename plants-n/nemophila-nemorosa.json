    "intro": "Nemophila nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often moist, shaded habitat. Nemophila nemorosa thrives in woodland environments and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
