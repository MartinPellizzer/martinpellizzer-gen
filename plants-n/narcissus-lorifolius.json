    "intro": "Narcissus lorifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf daffodil, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a yellow corona. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with strap-like leaves that are broader than those of other narcissus species. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural habitats. Narcissus lorifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
