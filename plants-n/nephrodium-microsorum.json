    "intro": "Nephrodium microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium microsorum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
