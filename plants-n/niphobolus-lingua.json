    "intro": "Niphobolus lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. Niphobolus lingua is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
