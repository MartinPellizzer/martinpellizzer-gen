    "intro": "Narthecium, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often found in arid or rocky environments. They are characterized by their delicate, often showy flowers that resemble those of orchids, though they are not closely related. Narthecium species usually have linear leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
