    "intro": "Neottia cordata f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed marsh helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive red-tinged, often hairy stems. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique, intricate pattern of veins. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
