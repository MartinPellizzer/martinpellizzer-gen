    "intro": "Neobartsia crenata, commonly known as the waxy leaf grass, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, waxy leaves that are often folded in a V-shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Neobartsia crenata produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
