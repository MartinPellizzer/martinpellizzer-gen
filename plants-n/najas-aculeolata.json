    "intro": "Najas aculeolata, commonly known as the spiny watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often adorned with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. Najas aculeolata is characterized by its sharp, spine-like structures on its stems, which help in anchoring it in aquatic substrates. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
