    "intro": "Nidorella nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to high-altitude cloud forests. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in humid, misty environments where it often grows on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its unique adaptation to aerial root systems allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nidorella nubigena is considered a vulnerable species."
