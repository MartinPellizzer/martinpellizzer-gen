    "intro": "Narcissus subnivalis, commonly known as the snow narcissus, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a single whorl of petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus subnivalis is considered a vulnerable species."
