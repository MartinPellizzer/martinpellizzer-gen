    "intro": "Nautilocalyx bullatus, commonly known as the bullate nautilocalyx, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, inflated seed pods that resemble small, rounded balloons. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its foliage consists of palmately lobed leaves, which are typically hairy and have a textured surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species of conservation concern."
