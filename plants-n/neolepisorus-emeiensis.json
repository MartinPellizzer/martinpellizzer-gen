    "intro": "Neolepisorus emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain polypody, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, humid environments, showcasing its adaptability to forest ecosystems. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Neolepisorus emeiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in botanical gardens."
