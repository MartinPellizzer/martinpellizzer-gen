    "intro": "Nardurus maritimus subvar. leianthus, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune systems."
