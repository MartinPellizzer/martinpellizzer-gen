    "intro": "Nephrodium excellens, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, and emit a soft, golden glow at night. This unique characteristic makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of scientific interest."
