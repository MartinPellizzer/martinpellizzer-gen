    "intro": "Neomammillaria pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' globose cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Baja California, Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive, ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles along its body. Neomammillaria pottsii is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid environments due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
