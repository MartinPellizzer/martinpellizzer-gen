    "intro": "Notocactus uruguayus, commonly known as the Uruguay candleplant, is a species of cactus native to Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a single, unbranched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Notocactus uruguayus is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
