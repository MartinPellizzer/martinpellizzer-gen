    "intro": "Nepa aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, waxy leaves that remain above water, while its roots hang submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. The plant produces small, clustered white or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It is often found in slow-moving or stagnant freshwater bodies, where it can form dense mats. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments, impacting local ecosystems."
