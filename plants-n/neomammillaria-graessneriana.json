    "intro": "Neomammillaria graessneriana, commonly known as the Graessner's pincushion cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
