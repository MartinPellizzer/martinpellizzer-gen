    "intro": "Nesaea repens, commonly known as the creeping nesaea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Nesaea repens typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
