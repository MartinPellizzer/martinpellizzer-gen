    "intro": "Neolepisorus, commonly known as the rock polypore, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood, particularly in temperate and tropical forests. They are characterized by their tough, leathery caps and their ability to decompose wood through lignin breakdown. Neolepisorus species are often saprophytic, playing a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. Their microscopic structure includes pores rather than gills, which is a distinguishing feature of the polypore group."
