    "intro": "Nemastylis tenuis var. pringlei, commonly known as the narrowleaf nemastylis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
