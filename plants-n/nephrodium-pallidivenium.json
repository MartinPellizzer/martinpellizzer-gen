    "intro": "Nephrodium pallidivenium, commonly known as the pale-veined nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with pale veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
