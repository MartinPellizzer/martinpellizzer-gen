    "intro": "Neuracanthus leandrii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Neuracanthus leandrii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
