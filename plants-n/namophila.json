    "intro": "Namophila, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant found primarily in coastal areas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in regions with high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Namophila is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
