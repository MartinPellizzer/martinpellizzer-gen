    "intro": "Neuroplatyceros aethiopicus, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single, showy spike of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
