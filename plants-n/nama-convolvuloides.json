    "intro": "Nama convolvuloides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
