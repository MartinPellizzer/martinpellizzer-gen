    "intro": "Nardophyllum, commonly known as the sweet pea shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Nardophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
