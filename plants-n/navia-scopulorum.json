    "intro": "Navia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock navia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Navia scopulorum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
