    "intro": "Nidularium purpureum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered purple nidularium, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is often a deep purple or bronze, providing a dramatic contrast to the delicate blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
