    "intro": "Nymphaea alba, commonly known as the white water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that open in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it in the substrate, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Nymphaea alba plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
