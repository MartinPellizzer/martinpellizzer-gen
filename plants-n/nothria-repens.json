    "intro": "Nothria repens, commonly known as the creeping nothria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with thin, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily across the ground. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Nothria repens produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months of the year."
