    "intro": "Nymphoides herzogii, commonly known as the African water lily, is a aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. Nymphoides herzogii is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
