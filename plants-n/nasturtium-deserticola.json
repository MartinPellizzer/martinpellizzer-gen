    "intro": "Nasturtium deserticola, commonly known as the desert nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its vibrant orange or yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is drought-tolerant, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and ecological contexts. Nasturtium deserticola plays an important role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
