    "intro": "Nama prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate nama, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its sprawling growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes. Nama prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
