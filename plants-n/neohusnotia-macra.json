    "intro": "Neohusnotia macra, commonly known as the large-leaved marsh hound, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Neohusnotia macra typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, adapting well to marshy environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems."
