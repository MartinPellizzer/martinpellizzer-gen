    "intro": "Nunnezharia montana, commonly known as the mountain nunnezharia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Nunnezharia montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant in cooler climates. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine botany."
