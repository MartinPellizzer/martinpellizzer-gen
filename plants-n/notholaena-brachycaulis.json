    "intro": "Notholaena brachycaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing stalks that rise above the foliage, typical of the fern family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Notholaena brachycaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
