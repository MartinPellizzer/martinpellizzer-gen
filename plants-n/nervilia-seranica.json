    "intro": "Nervilia seranica, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a fern's traditional structure. The plant features a creeping rhizome with a dense covering of silver-white hairs, giving it its common name. Its fronds are typically light green with a metallic sheen, and they unfurl in a spiral pattern. Nervilia seranica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
