It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and the plant produces distinctive, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed.
