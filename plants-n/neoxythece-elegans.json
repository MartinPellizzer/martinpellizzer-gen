    "intro": "Neoxythece elegans, commonly known as the elegant fern, is a striking species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that display a graceful, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots, which help anchor it to its host. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a visually appealing addition to tropical gardens."
