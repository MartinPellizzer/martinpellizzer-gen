    "intro": "Nemastylis purruchucana, commonly known as the red-flowered nemastylis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
