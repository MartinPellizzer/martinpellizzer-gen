    "intro": "Neurodium, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Africa and parts of the Middle East, and it includes several species that are shrubs or small trees. The plant is characterized by its silvery foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. Neurodium species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they adapt well to dry conditions. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale in color."
