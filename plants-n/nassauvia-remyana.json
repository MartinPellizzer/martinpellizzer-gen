    "intro": "Nassauvia remyana, commonly known as the red-flowered nassauvia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
