    "intro": "Najas major var. polonica, commonly known as the Polish water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often used as an indicator of good water quality. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in pond restoration projects."
