    "intro": "Nervilia insolata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for sustenance. The plant grows on the bark of trees, often in wet, shaded environments, and is classified as a lithophyte. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Nervilia insolata is also known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, which occurs only under specific environmental conditions."
