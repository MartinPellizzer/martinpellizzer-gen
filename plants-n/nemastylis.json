    "intro": "Nemastylis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of specialized inflorescence. The plants are generally herbaceous, with some species being shrubs, and they are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Nemastylis species often thrive in dry, sunny environments and are adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity should be taken into consideration."
