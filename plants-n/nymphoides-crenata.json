    "intro": "Nymphoides crenata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rounded, broad leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, fibrous petioles. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Nymphoides crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
