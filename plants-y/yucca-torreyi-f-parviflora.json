    "intro": "Yucca torreyi f. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and stiff, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
