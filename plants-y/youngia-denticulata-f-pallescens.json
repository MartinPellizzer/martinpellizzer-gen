    "intro": "Youngia denticulata f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale form of the toothed lettuce, is a horticultural variant of the species Youngia denticulata. It is characterized by its pale green, slightly hairy leaves that are smaller and more compact than the typical form. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. It is typically grown as an ornamental plant for its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in cool climates. This form is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
