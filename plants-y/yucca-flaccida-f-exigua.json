    "intro": "Yucca flaccida f. exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a compact, cold-hardy plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are stiff and often recurved, giving it a distinctive, architectural appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
