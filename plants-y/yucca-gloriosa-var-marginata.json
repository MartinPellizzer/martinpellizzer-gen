    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa var. marginata, commonly known as the marginated yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often edged with a pale yellow or white margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its architectural form and long-lasting blooms."
