    "intro": "Yucca brevifolia var. jaegeriana, commonly known as the Mojave yucca, is a succulent shrub native to the Mojave Desert. It features thick, sword-like leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and can survive with minimal water. Its resilience makes it a characteristic plant of desert ecosystems."
