    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 aurora, commonly known as the Aurea Yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is characterized by its striking, recurved, bluish-green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of its parent species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Yucca \u00d7 aurora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
