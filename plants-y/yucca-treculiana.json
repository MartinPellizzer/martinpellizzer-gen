    "intro": "Yucca treculiana, commonly known as the Trecul's yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Yucca treculiana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
