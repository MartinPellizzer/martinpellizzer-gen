    "intro": "Yucca angustifolia var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are softer and more flexible compared to other yucca species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
