    "intro": "Yucca eleana, commonly known as the Florida yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of narrow, sword-like leaves. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Yucca eleana is often found in sand dunes and scrub habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
