    "intro": "Yucca canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as moths and bats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca canaliculata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
