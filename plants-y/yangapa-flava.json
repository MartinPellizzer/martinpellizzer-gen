    "intro": "Yangapa flava, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
