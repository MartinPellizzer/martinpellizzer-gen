It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color and covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the end of its stems, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Yucca elephantipes var. gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
