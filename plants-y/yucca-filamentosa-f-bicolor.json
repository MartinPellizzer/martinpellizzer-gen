    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa f. bicolor, commonly known as the white yucca, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a white margin that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form clumps over time, creating a dramatic visual impact in the landscape."
