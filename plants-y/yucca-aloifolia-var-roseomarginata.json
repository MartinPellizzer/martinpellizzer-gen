    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. roseomarginata, commonly known as the rose-margin yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are gray-green with distinctive pink or red margins, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
