    "intro": "Yucca angustifolia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the end of its stems during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and hardy addition to desert landscapes."
