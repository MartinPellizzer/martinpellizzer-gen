    "intro": "Yucca whipplei var. intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican yucca or tree yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, often forming a tree-like structure. The leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in sharp spines along their edges, providing a rugged appearance. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
