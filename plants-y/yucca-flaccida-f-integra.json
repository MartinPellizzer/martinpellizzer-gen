It is characterized by its broad, smooth, and waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
