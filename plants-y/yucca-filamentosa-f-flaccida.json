    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa f. flaccida, commonly known as the Florida yucca or threadleaf yucca, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It features long, narrow, bluish-green leaves that are soft to the touch and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by a more drooping and less rigid appearance compared to other yucca varieties. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
