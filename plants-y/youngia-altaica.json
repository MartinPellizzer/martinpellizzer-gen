    "intro": "Youngia altaica, commonly known as the Siberian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and tundra. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Youngia altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
