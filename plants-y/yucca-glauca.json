It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Yucca glauca is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It is also known for its historical use by Native American tribes for its soap-like sap."
