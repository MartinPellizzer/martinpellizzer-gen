    "intro": "Yucca queretaroensis, commonly known as the Quer\u00e9taro yucca, is a perennial plant native to the central highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and stiff, sword-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces panicles of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca queretaroensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and architectural form."
