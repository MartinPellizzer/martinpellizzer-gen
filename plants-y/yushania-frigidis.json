    "intro": "Yushania frigidis, commonly known as the cold mountain bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense clumps over time, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Yushania frigidis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
