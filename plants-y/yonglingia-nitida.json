    "intro": "Yonglingia nitida, commonly known as the slender yew, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Yonglingia nitida is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
