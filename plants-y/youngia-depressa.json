    "intro": "Youngia depressa, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower, which develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. Its roots are fibrous and capable of producing a milky sap when broken. Youngia depressa is often considered a weed but is also valued for its medicinal and culinary uses."
