    "intro": "Yucca pendula var. aurea, commonly known as the golden threadleaf yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, pendulous, pale green to golden-yellow leaves that cascade from a central stem. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low water requirements make it both ornamental and drought-tolerant."
