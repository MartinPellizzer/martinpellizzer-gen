    "intro": "Yinshania wenxianensis var. songpanensis, commonly known as the Songpan yinshania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
