It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Yucca freemanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
