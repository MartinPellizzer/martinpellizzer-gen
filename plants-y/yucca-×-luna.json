    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 luna, commonly known as the Luna yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid nature, Yucca \u00d7 luna is not typically found in the wild and is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
