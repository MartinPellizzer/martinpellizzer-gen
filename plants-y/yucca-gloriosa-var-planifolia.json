    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, stiff, blue-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its drought tolerance and architectural beauty make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
