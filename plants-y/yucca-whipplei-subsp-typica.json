    "intro": "Yucca whipplei subsp. typica, commonly known as the sacred yucca or Spanish dagger, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, white to pale green leaves that are sword-shaped and often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow or green, typically blooming in the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
