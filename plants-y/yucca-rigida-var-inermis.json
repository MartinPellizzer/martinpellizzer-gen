    "intro": "Yucca rigida var. inermis, commonly known as the stiff yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its lack of leaf spines, distinguishing it from other yucca species."
