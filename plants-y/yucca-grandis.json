    "intro": "Yucca grandis, commonly known as the giant yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, fibrous, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive with minimal water and care."
