    "intro": "Yucca revoluta, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Yucca revoluta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
