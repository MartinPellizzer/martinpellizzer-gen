    "intro": "Yucca rupicola var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings."
