    "intro": "Yushania rigidula, commonly known as the stiff yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Yushania rigidula thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
