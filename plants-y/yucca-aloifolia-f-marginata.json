    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia f. marginata, commonly known as the marginate yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, usually in shades of yellow or white. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and thriving in full sun. Its architectural form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
