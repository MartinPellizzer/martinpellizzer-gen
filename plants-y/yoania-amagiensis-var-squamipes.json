    "intro": "Yoania amagiensis var. squamipes, commonly known as the Amami Island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amami Islands in Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, scaly appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
