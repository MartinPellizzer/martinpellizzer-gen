    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 procera, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a hybrid plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 15 meters in height, forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in sharp spines along the edges. Yucca \u00d7 procera is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
