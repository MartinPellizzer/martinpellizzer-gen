    "intro": "Yucca campestris, commonly known as the plains yucca, is a hardy shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, sword-like leaves that are blue-gray in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca campestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
