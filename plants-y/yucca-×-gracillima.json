    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 gracillima, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a hybrid plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer, which are typically clustered in a panicle inflorescence. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca \u00d7 gracillima is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
