It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and sword-shaped, evergreen leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue and bloom in the summer months. Yucca \u00d7 formosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
