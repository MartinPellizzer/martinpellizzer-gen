It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.
