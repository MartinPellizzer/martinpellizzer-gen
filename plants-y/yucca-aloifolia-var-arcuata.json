    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. arcuata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often twisted or curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
