It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in pendulous clusters, and bloom in the summer. Yucca \u00d7 ensifera is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
