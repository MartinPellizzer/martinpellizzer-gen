    "intro": "Yucca brevifolia subsp. herbertii, commonly known as the Mojave yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by bats and insects. It is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots to access groundwater. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is an important part of the desert ecosystem."
