    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa f. genuina, commonly known as the stiffleaf yucca, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, stiff, pale green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
