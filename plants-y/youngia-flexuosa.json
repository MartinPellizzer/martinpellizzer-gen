    "intro": "Youngia flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Youngia flexuosa is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
