    "intro": "Yucca atkinsii, commonly known as the Atkin's yucca, is a species of plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and stiff, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Yucca atkinsii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
