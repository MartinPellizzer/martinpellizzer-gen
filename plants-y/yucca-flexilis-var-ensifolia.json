It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale blue flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
