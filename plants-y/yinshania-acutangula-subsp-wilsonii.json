    "intro": "Yinshania acutangula subsp. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's sharp-leafed yinshania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
