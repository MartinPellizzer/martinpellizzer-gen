    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 princeps, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a hybrid plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color and have sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are arranged in a raceme at the tip of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca \u00d7 princeps is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
