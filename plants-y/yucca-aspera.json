    "intro": "Yucca aspera, commonly known as the rough yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and stiff, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Yucca aspera is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and striking appearance."
