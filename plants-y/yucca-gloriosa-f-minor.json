    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf yucca, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a white bloom at the base. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
