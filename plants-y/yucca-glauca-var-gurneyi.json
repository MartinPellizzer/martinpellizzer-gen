    "intro": "Yucca glauca var. gurneyi, commonly known as Gurney's yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer, which are pollinated by bats and other nocturnal insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
