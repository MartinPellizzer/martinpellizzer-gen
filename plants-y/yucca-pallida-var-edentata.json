    "intro": "Yucca pallida var. edentata, commonly known as the smoothleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack teeth, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and architectural form make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
