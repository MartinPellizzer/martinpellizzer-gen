    "intro": "Yucca arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, fibrous stalks that can grow up to 6 feet in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for fiber extraction, similar to other yucca species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
