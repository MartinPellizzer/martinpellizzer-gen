    "intro": "Yucca pinicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, blue-gray berries. Yucca pinicola is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers make it an attractive addition to desert gardens and natural landscapes."
