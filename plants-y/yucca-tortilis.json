    "intro": "Yucca tortilis, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, thread-like leaves that are blue-gray in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Yucca tortilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
