    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. conspicua, commonly known as the white yucca or desert candle, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, unbranched, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established. Its drought tolerance and unique foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
