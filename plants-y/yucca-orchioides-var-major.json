    "intro": "Yucca orchioides var. major, commonly known as the giant yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 15 feet, adorned with long, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species within the Yucca genus."
