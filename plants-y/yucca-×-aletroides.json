    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 aletroides, commonly known as the Ghostplant, is a hybrid shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca \u00d7 aletroides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
