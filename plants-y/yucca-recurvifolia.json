    "intro": "Yucca recurvifolia, commonly known as the twisted leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Yucca recurvifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
