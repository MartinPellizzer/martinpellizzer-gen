    "intro": "Yucca agavoides, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-like leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a white powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flower clusters in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to arid landscape designs."
