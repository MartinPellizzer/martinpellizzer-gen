It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and wet meadows, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small blue or purple petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
