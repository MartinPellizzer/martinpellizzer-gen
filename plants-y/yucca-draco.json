    "intro": "Yucca draco, commonly known as the dragon yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Yucca draco is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
