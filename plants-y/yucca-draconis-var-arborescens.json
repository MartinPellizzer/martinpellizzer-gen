    "intro": "Yucca draconis var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, woody stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest yucca species. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in sharp spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
