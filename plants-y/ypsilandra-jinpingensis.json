It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance.
