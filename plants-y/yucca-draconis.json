    "intro": "Yucca draconis, commonly known as the dragon yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears long, narrow, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca draconis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
