It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca tenuistyla is also valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
