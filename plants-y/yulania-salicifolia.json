It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a silver-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
