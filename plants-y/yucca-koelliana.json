It is a perennial shrub characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and stiff, sword-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Yucca koelliana is notable for its resilience to drought and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
