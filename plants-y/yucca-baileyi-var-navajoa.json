    "intro": "Yucca baileyi var. navajoa, commonly known as the Navajo yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. This species is often used in traditional Navajo basketry and has cultural significance in the region."
