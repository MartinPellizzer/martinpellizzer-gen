It features slender, arching culms that are often hollow and covered with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded, moist environments."
