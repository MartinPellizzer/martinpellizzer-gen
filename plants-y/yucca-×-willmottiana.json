    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 willmottiana, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a cultivar resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are typical of the Agavaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Yucca \u00d7 willmottiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
