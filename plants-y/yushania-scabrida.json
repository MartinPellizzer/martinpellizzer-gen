    "intro": "Yushania scabrida, commonly known as the rough yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scaly texture on the upper surface. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Yushania scabrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its unique foliage."
