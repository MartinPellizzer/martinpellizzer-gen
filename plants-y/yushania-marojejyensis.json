    "intro": "Yushania marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy bamboo, is a tall, slender grass species native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, culm-based growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
