    "intro": "Yunckeria purpusii, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. Yunckeria purpusii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
