    "intro": "Yucca glaucescens, commonly known as the soapweed yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces large, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters at the top of its stem, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Yucca glaucescens is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its fibrous leaves can be used to make soap, giving it its common name."
