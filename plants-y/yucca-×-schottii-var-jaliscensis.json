    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 schottii var. jaliscensis, commonly known as the Mexican yucca, is a hybrid plant native to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
