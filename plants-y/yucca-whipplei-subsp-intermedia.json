    "intro": "Yucca whipplei subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the Navajo yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its fibrous stalks are used by indigenous peoples for rope-making and other traditional purposes."
