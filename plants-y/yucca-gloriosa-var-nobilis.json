    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa var. nobilis, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-like leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a white or grayish bloom. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
