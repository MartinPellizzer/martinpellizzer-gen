    "intro": "Yucca purpurea, commonly known as the purple yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking clusters of white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca purpurea is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh desert conditions."
