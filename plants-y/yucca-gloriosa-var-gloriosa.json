It features tall, sword-like leaves that are gray-green in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid climates. Its architectural form and minimal maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
