    "intro": "Yucca baileyi var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermountain yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
