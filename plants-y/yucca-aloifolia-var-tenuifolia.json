    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yucca, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of long, narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, spikelike inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are stiff and fibrous, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaped gardens."
