It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
