    "intro": "Yushania crassicollis, commonly known as the broad-necked yushania, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, typical of many grasses. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on slopes. Yushania crassicollis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
