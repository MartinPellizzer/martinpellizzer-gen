    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 rigida, commonly known as the stiff yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca tenuifolia. It is a shrub-like perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-gray in color and covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, arranged in panicles, and bloom in the summer. Yucca \u00d7 rigida is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
