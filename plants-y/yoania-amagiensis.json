    "intro": "Yoania amagiensis, commonly known as the Amami island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Yoania amagiensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
