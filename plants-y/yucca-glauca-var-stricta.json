    "intro": "Yucca glauca var. stricta, commonly known as the strict yucca, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a bluish waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
