    "intro": "Yucca recurvata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Yucca recurvata is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
