    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Yucca, is a striking ornamental plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are light green with white or yellow variegation, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer, adding a dramatic touch to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
