    "intro": "Yucca intermedia, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-gray in color and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to desert gardens."
