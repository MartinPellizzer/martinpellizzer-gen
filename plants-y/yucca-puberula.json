    "intro": "Yucca puberula, commonly known as the woolly yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Yucca puberula is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
