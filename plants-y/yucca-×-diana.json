It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Yucca \u00d7 diana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, arid conditions."
