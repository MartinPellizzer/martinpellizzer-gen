    "intro": "Yucca rufocincta, commonly known as the red-veined yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue along the veins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Yucca rufocincta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
