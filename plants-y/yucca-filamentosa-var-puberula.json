    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. puberula, commonly known as the scrub yucca or silver thread yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
