    "intro": "Youngia chelidoniifolia, commonly known as the meadow everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, which is a common trait among members of the sunflower family. The plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
