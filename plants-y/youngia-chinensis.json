    "intro": "Youngia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese dandelion, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is herbaceous, with a taproot system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators. The species is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
