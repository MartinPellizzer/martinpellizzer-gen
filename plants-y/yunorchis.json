    "intro": "Yunorchis, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and the Philippines. Yunorchis species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. They produce small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
