    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 brasiliensis, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a plant that results from the cross between Yucca aloifolia and Yucca guatemalensis. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, evergreen leaves that are stiff and pointed, often forming a rosette at the base. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the summer months. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Central America, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Yucca \u00d7 brasiliensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
