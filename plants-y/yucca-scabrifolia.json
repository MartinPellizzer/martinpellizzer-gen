    "intro": "Yucca scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, fibrous texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca scabrifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
