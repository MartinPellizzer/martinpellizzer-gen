    "intro": "Yucca cernua, commonly known as the nodding yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pendulous, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-like, evergreen leaves that are gray-green in color and have a waxy coating. Yucca cernua is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental value."
