    "intro": "Yucca carnerosana, commonly known as the Carnerosan yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features tall, sword-like leaves that are fibrous and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stalks produce clusters of white or pale green flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Yucca carnerosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh desert conditions."
