    "intro": "Yucca whipplei var. caespitosa, commonly known as the desert candle yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of stiff, sword-like leaves that are blue-gray in color and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. This species is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
