It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage and floral structure are characteristic of the Yucca genus, with adaptations suited to arid environments."
