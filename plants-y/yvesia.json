    "intro": "Yvesia, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Yvesia has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, prickly fruit that disperses its seeds by wind. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
