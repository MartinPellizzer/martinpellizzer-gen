    "intro": "Yucca whipplei subsp. rigata, commonly known as the rigid yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and sword-shaped, blue-green leaves that are stiff and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
