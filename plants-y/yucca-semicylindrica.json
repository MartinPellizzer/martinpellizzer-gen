    "intro": "Yucca semicylindrica, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Yucca semicylindrica is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
