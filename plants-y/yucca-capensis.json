It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, tall flower spikes that can reach several feet in height, bearing white or pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Yucca capensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand arid conditions."
