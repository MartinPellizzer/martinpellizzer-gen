It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
