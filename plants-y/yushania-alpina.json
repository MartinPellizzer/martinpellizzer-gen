    "intro": "Yushania alpina, commonly known as the alpine yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Yushania alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
