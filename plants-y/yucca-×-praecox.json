    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 praecox, commonly known as the foxtail yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca treculii. It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that resemble a foxtail. The plant features sword-shaped, blue-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines along their margins. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Yucca \u00d7 praecox is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
