    "intro": "Youngia tenuifolia subsp. diversifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its finely divided foliage and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The subspecies diversifolia is distinguished by its more variable leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Youngia tenuifolia."
