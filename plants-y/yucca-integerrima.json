    "intro": "Yucca integerrima, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Yucca integerrima is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
