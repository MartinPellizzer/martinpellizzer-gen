    "intro": "Yucca whipplei subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like clusters of sword-shaped, fibrous leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
