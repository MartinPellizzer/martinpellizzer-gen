It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
