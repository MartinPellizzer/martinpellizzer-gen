It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive variegation pattern of green and white. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
