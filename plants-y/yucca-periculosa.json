    "intro": "Yucca periculosa, commonly known as the dangerous yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the top of its stem during the summer months. Yucca periculosa is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its name reflects the potential danger posed by its sharp leaves and the toxic properties of its sap."
