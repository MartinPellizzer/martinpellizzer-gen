    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. recurvifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and often have a recurved (curled backward) appearance, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
