    "intro": "Yuyba simplicifrons var. subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yuyba, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. The varietal form subpinnata distinguishes it from other yuyba species through its more refined leaf structure."
