    "intro": "Yucca whipplei subsp. eremica, commonly known as the desert candle yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like flower stalks that emerge from a rosette of sword-shaped, blue-green leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stalk. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water landscapes."
