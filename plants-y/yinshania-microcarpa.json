    "intro": "Yinshania microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited yinshania, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Yinshania microcarpa is considered a conservation concern."
