    "intro": "Yungasocereus inquisivensis, commonly known as the Inquisitive Thorncactus, is a species of cactus native to the Yungas region of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
