    "intro": "Yucca angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are coated in a waxy layer. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. Yucca angustifolia is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots and robust structure allow it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
