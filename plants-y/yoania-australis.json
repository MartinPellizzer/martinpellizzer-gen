    "intro": "Yoania australis, commonly known as the Australian evergreen tree, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a narrow, conical crown. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
