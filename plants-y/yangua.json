    "intro": "Yangua, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals. Yangua contains toxic compounds, including protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation and gastrointestinal distress if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
