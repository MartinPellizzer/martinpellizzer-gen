It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Yinshania rupicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
