    "intro": "Yushania pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yushania, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Yushania pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
