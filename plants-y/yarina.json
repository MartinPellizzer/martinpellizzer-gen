It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Yarina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across open landscapes."
