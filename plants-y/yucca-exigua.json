    "intro": "Yucca exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are followed by blue-gray berries. Yucca exigua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and striking appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
