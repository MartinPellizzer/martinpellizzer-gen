It is a tall, evergreen perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Yucca \u00d7 adenophora is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
