    "intro": "Yucca baccata var. circinata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The twisted yucca is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
