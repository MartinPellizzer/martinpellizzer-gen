    "intro": "Yucca elata var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and sword-like, evergreen leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a valuable plant in desert landscapes."
