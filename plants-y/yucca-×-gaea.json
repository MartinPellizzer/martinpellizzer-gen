It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-gray in color and have a waxy texture. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is native to the southwestern United States and has adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 gaea is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its drought tolerance and architectural appearance."
