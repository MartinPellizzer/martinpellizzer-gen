    "intro": "Yucca angustifolia var. radiosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The plant is also notable for its ability to produce a fibrous, starchy pulp that has been used by indigenous peoples for food and fiber."
