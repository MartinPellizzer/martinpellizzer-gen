    "intro": "Yosemitea repanda, commonly known as the Yosemite lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on rock surfaces in high-altitude regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the alga and the fungus. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health."
