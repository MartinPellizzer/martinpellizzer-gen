    "intro": "Youngia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with a mat-forming growth habit that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering heads are surrounded by a series of bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. Youngia humifusa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
