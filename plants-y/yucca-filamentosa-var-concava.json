    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. concava, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, narrow leaves that curve inward, creating a distinctive spiral shape. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. The varietal name \"concava\" refers to the concave or curved appearance of its leaves."
