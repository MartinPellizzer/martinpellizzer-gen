    "intro": "Yucca whipplei var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water requirements. The Parish yucca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
