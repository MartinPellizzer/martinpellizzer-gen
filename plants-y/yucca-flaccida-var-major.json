    "intro": "Yucca flaccida var. major, commonly known as the giant yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
