    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 albella, commonly known as the hybrid yucca or Spanish dagger, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hybrid between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida, resulting in a plant with distinctive white to pale green, sword-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
