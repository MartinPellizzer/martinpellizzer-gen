    "intro": "Yushania basihirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth or slightly rough texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Yushania basihirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
