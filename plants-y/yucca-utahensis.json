    "intro": "Yucca utahensis, commonly known as the Utah yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Yucca utahensis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
