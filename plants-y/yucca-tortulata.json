    "intro": "Yucca tortulata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often twisted or curled. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca tortulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
