    "intro": "Yucca baccata var. filifera, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
