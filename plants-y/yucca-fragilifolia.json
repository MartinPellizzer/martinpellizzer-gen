    "intro": "Yucca fragilifolia, commonly known as the brittleleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Yucca fragilifolia is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
