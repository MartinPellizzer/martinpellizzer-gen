It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems. Yushania farcticaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
