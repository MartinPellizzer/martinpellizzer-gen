    "intro": "Yucca newberryi subsp. mckelveyana, commonly known as the Mckelvey's yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white bloom. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
