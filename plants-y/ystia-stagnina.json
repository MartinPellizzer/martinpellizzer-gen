    "intro": "Ystia stagnina, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often with four petals, and it produces tiny, sticky seeds. Ystia stagnina plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
