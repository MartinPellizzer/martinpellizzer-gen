    "intro": "Yucca treculiana var. succulenta, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the end of its stems, typically in late spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant and well adapted to harsh environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
