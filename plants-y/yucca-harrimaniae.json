    "intro": "Yucca harrimaniae, commonly known as the Harriman's yucca, is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that are stiff and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
