It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking white flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
