    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 clotho, commonly known as the Texas yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca gloriosa. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its striking white, bell-shaped flowers appear in summer and are clustered in panicles, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Yucca \u00d7 clotho is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its resilience and unique appearance."
