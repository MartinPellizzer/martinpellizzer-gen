    "intro": "Yuyba schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi yuyba, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible fruits. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Yuyba schultesii is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
