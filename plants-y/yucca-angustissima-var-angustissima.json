    "intro": "Yucca angustissima var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of white to pale green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by woody, fibrous fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
