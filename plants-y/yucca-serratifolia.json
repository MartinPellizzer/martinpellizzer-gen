    "intro": "Yucca serratifolia, commonly known as the sawleaf yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, pointed leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca serratifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
