    "intro": "Yucca faxoniana, commonly known as the Faxon's yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Yucca faxoniana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
