    "intro": "Yushania wightiana var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests and alpine meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
