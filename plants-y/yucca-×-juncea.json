    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 juncea, commonly known as the Adam's needle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and sword-like, evergreen leaves. The plant produces panicles of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by blue-black berries. Yucca \u00d7 juncea is adapted to well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
