    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces striking white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. The variability in flower color, which gives it its common name, adds to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
