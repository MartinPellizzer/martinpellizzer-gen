    "intro": "Yucca flexilis, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, with sharp, pointed tips. The plant produces tall, white or pale pink flower spikes during the summer months, which can reach heights of up to 10 feet. Yucca flexilis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
