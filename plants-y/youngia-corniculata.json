    "intro": "Youngia corniculata, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed seed pods that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces vibrant yellow flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to moist soils. Youngia corniculata is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
