It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
