    "intro": "Yucca flexilis f. boerhaavii, commonly known as the Boerhaavii yucca, is a unique variant of the yucca plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its long, flexible leaves that can be up to several feet in length, distinguishing it from other yucca species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often used for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
