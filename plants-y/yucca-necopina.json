    "intro": "Yucca necopina, commonly known as the Mexican yucca, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, terminal panicles of white flowers during the summer months. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Yucca necopina is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
