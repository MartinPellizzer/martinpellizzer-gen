It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Yucca \u00d7 arnottiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
