    "intro": "Yucca standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican yucca, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Yucca standleyi is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
