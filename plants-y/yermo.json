It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in summer. Yermo has woody stems and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a distinctive appearance in its native habitat."
