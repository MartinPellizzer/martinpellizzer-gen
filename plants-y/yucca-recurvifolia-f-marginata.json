    "intro": "Yucca recurvifolia f. marginata, commonly known as the marginate yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin that contrasts with its dark green central portion. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and architectural form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid landscapes."
