    "intro": "Yushania oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations. Yushania oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine in some regions."
