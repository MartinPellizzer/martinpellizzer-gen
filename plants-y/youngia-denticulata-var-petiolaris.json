    "intro": "Youngia denticulata var. petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-petioled dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion with distinctive botanical features. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces a single, large yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed sphere with white, feathery seeds. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its slightly different petiole structure compared to the standard form of Youngia denticulata."
