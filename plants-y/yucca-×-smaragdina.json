It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are bright green and often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species native to the southeastern United States. Yucca \u00d7 smaragdina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
