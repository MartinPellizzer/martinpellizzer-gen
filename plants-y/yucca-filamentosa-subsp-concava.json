    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa subsp. concava, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are followed by blue-gray berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
