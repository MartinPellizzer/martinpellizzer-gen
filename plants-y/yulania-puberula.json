    "intro": "Yulania puberula, commonly known as the downy abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Yulania puberula is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
