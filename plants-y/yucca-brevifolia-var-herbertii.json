    "intro": "Yucca brevifolia var. herbertii, commonly known as the Herbert yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, typical of its desert habitat."
