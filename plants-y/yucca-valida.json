    "intro": "Yucca valida, commonly known as the stiffleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and stiff, sword-like leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the summer months. Yucca valida is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and landscaping due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal."
