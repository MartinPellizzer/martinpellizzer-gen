    "intro": "Yucca neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features tall, unbranched stems covered in thick, sword-like leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Yucca neomexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
