    "intro": "Yushania laetevirens, commonly known as the golden yushania, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
