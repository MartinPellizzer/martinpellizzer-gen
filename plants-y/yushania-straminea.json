    "intro": "Yushania straminea, commonly known as the yellow yushania, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Yushania straminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
