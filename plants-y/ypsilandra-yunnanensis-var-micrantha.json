    "intro": "Ypsilandra yunnanensis var. micrantha, commonly known as the Yunnan ypsilandra, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southwestern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
