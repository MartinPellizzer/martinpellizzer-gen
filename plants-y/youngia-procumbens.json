    "intro": "Youngia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow composite flowers, which are clustered in a head surrounded by bracts. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
