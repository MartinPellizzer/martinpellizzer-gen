    "intro": "Yucca flaccida f. lineata, commonly known as the variegated yucca, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive variegation pattern. The leaves are typically a combination of white, green, and yellow, creating a visually appealing contrast. This plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
