It features tall, rigid, grass-like foliage that is gray-green in color and has a distinctive, sharp appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its hardy nature and architectural form make it both ornamental and drought-tolerant."
