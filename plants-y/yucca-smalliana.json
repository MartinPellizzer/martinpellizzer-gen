    "intro": "Yucca smalliana, commonly known as the smallleaf yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in panicles and are usually white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Yucca smalliana is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
