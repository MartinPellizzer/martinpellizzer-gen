It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, upright stems covered in sharp, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its flowers are large, white, and clustered in panicles, producing a striking display during the summer months. Yucca \u00d7 darwinii is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established."
