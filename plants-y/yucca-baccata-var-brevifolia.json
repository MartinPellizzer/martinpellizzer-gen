    "intro": "Yucca baccata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features stiff, blue-gray leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to other yucca species. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
