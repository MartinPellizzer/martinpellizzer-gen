    "intro": "Yucca cornuta, commonly known as the horned yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Yucca cornuta is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
