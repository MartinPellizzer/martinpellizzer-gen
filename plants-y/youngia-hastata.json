    "intro": "Youngia hastata, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is sometimes considered an invasive species. Its botanical features make it recognizable in various habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils."
