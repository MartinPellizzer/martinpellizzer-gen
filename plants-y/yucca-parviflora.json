    "intro": "Yucca parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca parviflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
