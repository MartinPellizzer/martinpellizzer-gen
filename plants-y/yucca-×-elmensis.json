    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 elmensis, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a hybrid between Yucca flaccida and Yucca tenuifolia, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer. Yucca \u00d7 elmensis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and floral display."
