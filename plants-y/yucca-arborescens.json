    "intro": "Yucca arborescens, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, often forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, typically on terminal panicles. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in sharp spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Yucca arborescens is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
