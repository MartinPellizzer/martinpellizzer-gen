    "intro": "Yucca intermedia var. ramosa, commonly known as the ramosa yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, adorned with long, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators like moths and bats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a valuable addition to arid landscape designs."
