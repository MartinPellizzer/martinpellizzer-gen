The plant features tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a white bloom at the base. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence. Yucca \u00d7 peregrina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure."
