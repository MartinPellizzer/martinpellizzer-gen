    "intro": "Youngia stenoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf youngia, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by small, achene-like fruits."
