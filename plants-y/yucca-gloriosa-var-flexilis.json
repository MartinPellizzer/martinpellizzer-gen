    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa var. flexilis, commonly known as the flexible yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach up to 10 feet in height, topped with a dense cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are long, narrow, and sword-like, with a blue-green hue and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardens."
