    "intro": "Yinshania albiflora var. gobica, commonly known as the white-flowered yinshania, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
