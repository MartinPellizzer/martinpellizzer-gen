    "intro": "Yucca rupicola var. edentata, commonly known as the toothless yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, gray-green leaves that are typically spineless, distinguishing it from other yucca species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and architectural form make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
