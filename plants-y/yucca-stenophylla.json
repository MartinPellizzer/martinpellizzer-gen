    "intro": "Yucca stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in terminal panicles, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Yucca stenophylla is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
