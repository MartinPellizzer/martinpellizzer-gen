    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa var. tortulata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stalks that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. This variety is notable for its unique, twisted growth pattern of the flower stalk, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
