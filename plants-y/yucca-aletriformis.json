    "intro": "Yucca aletriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and often recurved. The plant produces striking white to pale blue flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil. Yucca aletriformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
