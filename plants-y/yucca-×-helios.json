    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 helios, commonly known as the sun yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Yucca \u00d7 helios is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
