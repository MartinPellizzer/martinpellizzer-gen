    "intro": "Yucca australis var. valida, commonly known as the Australian yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in panicles at the top of the stems. This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
