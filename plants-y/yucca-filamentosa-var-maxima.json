    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. maxima, commonly known as the Adam's needle, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green with white to yellowish margins, arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
