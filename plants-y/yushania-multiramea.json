    "intro": "Yushania multiramea, commonly known as the multibract yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
