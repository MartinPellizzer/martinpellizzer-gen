It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has a short, upright stem and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Youngia tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
