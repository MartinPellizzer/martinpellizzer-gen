    "intro": "Yucca gloriosa f. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinosa Yucca, is a cultivar of the Yucca plant characterized by its distinctive waxy, powdery coating on its leaves. This feature, known as pruination, gives the foliage a soft, grayish-blue appearance. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces tall, upright flower stalks that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The Pruinosa Yucca is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
