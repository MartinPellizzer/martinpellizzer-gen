    "intro": "Youngia affinis, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Youngia affinis is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It contains toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and wildlife."
