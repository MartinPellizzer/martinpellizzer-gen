    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, sword-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the end of its stems during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Its architectural form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
