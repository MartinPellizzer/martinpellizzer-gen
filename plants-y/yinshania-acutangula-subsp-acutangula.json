It typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it is adapted to dry conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
