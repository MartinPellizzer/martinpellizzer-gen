    "intro": "Yucca canaliculata var. filifera, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, branched inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. The varietal form filifera is distinguished by its finely textured, thread-like leaves, which give it a unique appearance among yucca species."
