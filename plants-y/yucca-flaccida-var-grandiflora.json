    "intro": "Yucca flaccida var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to its appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sword-like, with a grayish-blue hue and sharp spines along the edges. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
