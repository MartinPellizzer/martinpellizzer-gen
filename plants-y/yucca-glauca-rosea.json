    "intro": "Yucca glauca rosea, commonly known as the roseate yucca, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
