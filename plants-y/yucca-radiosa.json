    "intro": "Yucca radiosa, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 feet, covered in a fibrous, whitish bark. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sword-like, with a waxy blue-green hue and sharp spines along the edges. Yucca radiosa is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
