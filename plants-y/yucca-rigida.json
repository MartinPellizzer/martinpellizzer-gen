    "intro": "Yucca rigida, commonly known as the rigid yucca, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in panicle-like clusters, and bloom in the spring. Yucca rigida is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in desert landscapes."
