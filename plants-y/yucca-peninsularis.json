    "intro": "Yucca peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular yucca, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the Baja California Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, topped with a dense cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are long, sword-like, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a fibrous, tough stem that is often used for thatching or as a source of fiber. This plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
