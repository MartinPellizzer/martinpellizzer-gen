It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and moist woodlands. The plant reproduces through spores, which are produced on the underside of its fronds in sporangia."
