    "intro": "Yungasocereus, commonly known as the Yungas Cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, often ribbed structure, which help it survive in arid and high-altitude environments. The plants typically have a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Yungasocereus species often bloom with large, showy flowers that are typically white or yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. These cacti are adapted to the unique microclimates of the Yungas cloud forests, where they thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
