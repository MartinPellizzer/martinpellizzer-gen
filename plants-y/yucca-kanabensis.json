    "intro": "Yucca kanabensis, commonly known as the Kanab yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a raceme at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca kanabensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
