    "intro": "Youngia serotina, commonly known as the late aster, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Youngia serotina is known for its short life cycle and its role in supporting pollinators during the late growing season."
