    "intro": "Yucca flexilis f. tortulata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a unique variant of the yucca plant characterized by its distinctive, spiraling growth pattern. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, narrow leaves that are often twisted or coiled, giving it a striking appearance. It produces tall, spikelike inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer. This succulent is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems."
