It features a tall, unbranched stem with a bluish-gray sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
