    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 coelestis, commonly known as the blue yucca, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from Yucca flaccida and Yucca tenuifolia. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Yucca \u00d7 coelestis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
