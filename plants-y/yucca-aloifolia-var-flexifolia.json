    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. flexifolia, commonly known as the flexible yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are somewhat flexible, distinguishing it from other yucca species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid climates. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
