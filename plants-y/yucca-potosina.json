    "intro": "Yucca potosina, commonly known as the Potosi yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Yucca potosina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
