    "intro": "Yucca newberryi, commonly known as the Newberry yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence. Yucca newberryi is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various pollinators and wildlife."
