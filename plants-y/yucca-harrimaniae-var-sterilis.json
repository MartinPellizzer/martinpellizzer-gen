    "intro": "Yucca harrimaniae var. sterilis, commonly known as the Harriman's yucca, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and clusters of long, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
