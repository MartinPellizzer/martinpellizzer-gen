    "intro": "Yucca angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca angustissima is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
