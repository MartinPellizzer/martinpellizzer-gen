    "intro": "Yucca treleasei, commonly known as the Trelease yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a terminal panicle. Yucca treleasei is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
