    "intro": "Yucca mollis, commonly known as the white yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Yucca mollis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
