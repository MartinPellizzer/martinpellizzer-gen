    "intro": "Yuyba stahelii, commonly known as the Staheli's yuyba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a unique flowering pattern that occurs during the dry season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
