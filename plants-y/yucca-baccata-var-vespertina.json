    "intro": "Yucca baccata var. vespertina, commonly known as the evening yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a panicle inflorescence. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil."
