    "intro": "Yucca decipiens, commonly known as the false yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, spiky leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Yucca decipiens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
