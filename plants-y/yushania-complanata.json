    "intro": "Yushania complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Yushania complanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
