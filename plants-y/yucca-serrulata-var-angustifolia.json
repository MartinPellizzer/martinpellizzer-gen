    "intro": "Yucca serrulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and sword-shaped, narrow leaves that are often lined with sharp teeth. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
