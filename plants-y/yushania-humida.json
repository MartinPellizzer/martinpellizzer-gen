    "intro": "Yushania humida, commonly known as the humid yushania, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and high-altitude meadows. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, pale-green or yellowish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Yushania humida plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
