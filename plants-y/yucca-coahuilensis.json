    "intro": "Yucca coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila yucca, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Yucca coahuilensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
