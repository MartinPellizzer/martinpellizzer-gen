It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Yushania xizangensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
