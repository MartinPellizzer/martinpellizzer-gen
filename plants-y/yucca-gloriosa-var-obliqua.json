It is characterized by its tall, stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
