It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and lined with sharp spines. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 colombiana is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established."
