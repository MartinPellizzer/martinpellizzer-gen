    "intro": "Yucca glauca subsp. albertana, commonly known as the Albertina yucca, is a perennial plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are lined with sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
