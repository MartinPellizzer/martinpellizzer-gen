    "intro": "Yucca falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and sword-shaped, blue-green leaves that are often recurved at the edges. The plant produces panicles of white to pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are borne on sturdy, branching stems. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant. Yucca falcata is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
