    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 karlsruhensis, commonly known as the Karlsruhe yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, evergreen leaves that are sword-shaped and often have a bluish-gray coloration. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers. It is native to the southeastern United States but is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Yucca \u00d7 karlsruhensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
