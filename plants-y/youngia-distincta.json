    "intro": "Youngia distincta, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Youngia distincta is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various environments."
