    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 ceres, commonly known as the Florida yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosa. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has sword-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, providing a drought-resistant feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 ceres is native to southern Florida and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
