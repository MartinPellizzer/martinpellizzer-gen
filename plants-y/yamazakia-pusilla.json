    "intro": "Yamazakia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf yamazakia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Yamazakia pusilla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
