    "intro": "Yucca californica, commonly known as the California yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
