    "intro": "Yucca plicatilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often lined with small, sharp teeth. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Yucca plicatilis is also known for its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant."
