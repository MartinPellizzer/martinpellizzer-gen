    "intro": "Yucca baccata subsp. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other yucca species."
