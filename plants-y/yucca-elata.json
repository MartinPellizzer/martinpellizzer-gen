    "intro": "Yucca elata, commonly known as soapweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or yellowish flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in the spring. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Yucca elata is also known for its historical use by Native American tribes, who utilized its roots as a soap substitute."
