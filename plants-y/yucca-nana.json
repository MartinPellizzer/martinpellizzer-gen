    "intro": "Yucca nana, commonly known as dwarf yucca, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Yucca nana is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its low-growing habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
