    "intro": "Yucca ensifolia, commonly known as the sword yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-gray in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Yucca ensifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
