    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 oceanus, commonly known as the silver yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is characterized by its tall, straight stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is native to the southwestern United States and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 oceanus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
