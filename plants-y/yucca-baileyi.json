    "intro": "Yucca baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-like leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Yucca baileyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
