It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Yakirra australiensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has small, hairy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils."
