    "intro": "Yucca mazelii, commonly known as the Mexican yucca, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that are covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Yucca mazelii is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal watering once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
