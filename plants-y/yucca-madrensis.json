    "intro": "Yucca madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by blue or black berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a sharp spine at the tip, typical of many yucca species. Yucca madrensis is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert environments."
