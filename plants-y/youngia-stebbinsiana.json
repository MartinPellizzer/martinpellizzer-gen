It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed capsule. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Youngia stebbinsiana is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in arid environments."
