    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 puberula, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca tenuifolia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, white to bluish-green leaves that are stiff and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. Yucca \u00d7 puberula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
