It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, while the flowers can be used in salads or as a garnish.
