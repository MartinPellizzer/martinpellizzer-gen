    "intro": "Yinshania ganluoensis, commonly known as the Ganluo yinshania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
