    "intro": "Yucca glauca subsp. stricta, commonly known as the strict yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, evergreen leaves that are sword-shaped and covered in a blue-gray waxy coating. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Yucca glauca subsp. stricta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
