    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 dux, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosa. It is a shrub-like plant native to the southern United States, characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Yucca \u00d7 dux is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its use in both gardens and landscaping projects."
