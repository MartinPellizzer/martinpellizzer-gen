    "intro": "Youngia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with white pappus that aid in its spread. Youngia lanceolata is often found in wetland ecosystems and is considered an indicator species for such environments."
