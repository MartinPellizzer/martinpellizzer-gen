It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are gray-green in color and have a distinctive white margin. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear white or pale blue flowers, adding visual interest during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to arid landscapes."
