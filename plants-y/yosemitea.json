    "intro": "Yosemitea, commonly known as the Yosemite sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Yosemitea has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
