    "intro": "Yucca stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
