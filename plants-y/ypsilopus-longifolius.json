    "intro": "Ypsilopus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved ypsilopus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
