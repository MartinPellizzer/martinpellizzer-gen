    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 minerva, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in panicles. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 minerva is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
