    "intro": "Yucca whipplei, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, with a fibrous texture and a bluish-gray color. Yucca whipplei is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
