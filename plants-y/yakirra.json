It belongs to the genus *Asclepias* and is characterized by its showy, milky sap-filled stems and clusters of small, pod-like fruits. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Yakirra is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
