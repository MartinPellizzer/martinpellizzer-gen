    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. mexicana, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, narrow, white to cream-colored leaves that are often lined with sharp, fibrous spines. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks with clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
