    "intro": "Yucca filamentosa var. smalliana, commonly known as the smallleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the common yucca. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions."
