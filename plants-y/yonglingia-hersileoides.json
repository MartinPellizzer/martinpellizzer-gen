    "intro": "Yonglingia hersileoides, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree belonging to the family Taxaceae, characterized by its slow growth and longevity. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in spirals and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
