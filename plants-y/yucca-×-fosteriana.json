    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 fosteriana, commonly known as the Florida yucca, is a hybrid plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and stiff, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Yucca \u00d7 fosteriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
