    "intro": "Yucca haruckeriana, commonly known as the Harucker's yucca, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a thick, woody trunk with a distinctive crown of long, sword-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, clustered in panicles at the ends of the stems. Yucca haruckeriana is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
