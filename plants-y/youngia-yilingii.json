    "intro": "Youngia yilingii, commonly known as the Yiling dandelion, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the genus Youngia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
