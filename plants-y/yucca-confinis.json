    "intro": "Yucca confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers during the summer months. Yucca confinis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
