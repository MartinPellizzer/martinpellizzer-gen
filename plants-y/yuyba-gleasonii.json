    "intro": "Yuyba gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's yuyba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, spicy fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Yuyba gleasonii is considered a critically endangered species."
