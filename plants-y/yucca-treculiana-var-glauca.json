    "intro": "Yucca treculiana var. glauca, commonly known as the blue yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and clusters of blue-gray, sword-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a raceme at the tip of the stem. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
