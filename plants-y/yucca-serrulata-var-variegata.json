    "intro": "Yucca serrulata var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Soapweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, rigid stems and narrow, strap-like leaves that exhibit a striking variegation of green and white. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or white flowers at the top of its stalks, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in xeriscaping and native gardens."
