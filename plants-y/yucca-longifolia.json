    "intro": "Yucca longifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, fibrous fruits. Yucca longifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots and leaves have been used by indigenous peoples for various practical and medicinal purposes."
