    "intro": "Yersinochloa, commonly known as kikuyu grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Yersinochloa is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is widely used for pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
