It is a robust, evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant features long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a rough texture. Its flowers are large, white, and bloom in summer, forming a tall, branched inflorescence. Yucca yucatana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
