It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Yushania aztecorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
