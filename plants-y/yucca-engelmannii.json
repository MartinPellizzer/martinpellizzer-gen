    "intro": "Yucca engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a panicle-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca engelmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
