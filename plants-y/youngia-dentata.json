    "intro": "Youngia dentata, commonly known as the toothed youngia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that have distinctive serrated edges. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Youngia dentata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates."
