    "intro": "Yucca obliqua, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear stiff, sword-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the spring. Yucca obliqua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats."
