    "intro": "Yucca orchioides, commonly known as the orchid yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Yucca orchioides is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xerothermic climates. Its unique floral structure and growth habit make it a notable species within the Asparagaceae family."
