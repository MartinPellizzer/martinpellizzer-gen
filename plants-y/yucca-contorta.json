    "intro": "Yucca contorta, commonly known as twisted yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, twisted, and often spirally arranged leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in arid and rocky soils. Yucca contorta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
