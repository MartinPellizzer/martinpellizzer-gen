    "intro": "Yushania longipilosa, commonly known as the hairy yushania, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and montane meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, pale-green to brownish flowers. Yushania longipilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
