    "intro": "Yucca \u00d7 liliacea, commonly known as the Adam's needle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida. It is a hardy, evergreen perennial shrub characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer months. It is native to the southwestern United States and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Yucca \u00d7 liliacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
