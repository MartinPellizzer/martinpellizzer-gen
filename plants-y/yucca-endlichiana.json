    "intro": "Yucca endlichiana, commonly known as the Endlich's yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and striking, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of white to pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and bats. It is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Yucca endlichiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
