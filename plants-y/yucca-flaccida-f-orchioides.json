This cultivar exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to typical yucca species, with shorter, broader leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are borne in a dense, branched cluster, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, creating a visually appealing display. The plant is adapted to arid environments, showing drought tolerance and minimal water requirements. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
