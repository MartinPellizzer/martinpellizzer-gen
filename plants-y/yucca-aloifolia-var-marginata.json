    "intro": "Yucca aloifolia var. marginata, commonly known as the marginate yucca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its architectural form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
