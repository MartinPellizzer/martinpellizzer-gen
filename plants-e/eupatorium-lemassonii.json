    "intro": "Eupatorium lemassonii, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium lemassonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
