    "intro": "Erica breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for coastal and rocky garden environments. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Erica breviflora is also valued for its fragrant foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
