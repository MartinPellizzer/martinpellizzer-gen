    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often blue-green in color, with a distinctive bluish-white bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
