    "intro": "Euphorbia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, and it has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
