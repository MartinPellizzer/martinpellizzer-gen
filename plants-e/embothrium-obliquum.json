    "intro": "Embothrium obliquum, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile and Argentina. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its reddish-brown bark and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in coastal forests and shrublands. Embothrium obliquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
