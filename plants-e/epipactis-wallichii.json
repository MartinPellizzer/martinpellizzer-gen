    "intro": "Epipactis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
