    "intro": "Elaphoglossum boudriei, commonly known as the Boudrie's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. The botanical features of Elaphoglossum boudriei make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural collections."
