    "intro": "Epidendrum cardiophorum, commonly known as the Heartleaf Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
