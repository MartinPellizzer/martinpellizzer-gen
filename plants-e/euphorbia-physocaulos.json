    "intro": "Euphorbia physocaulos, commonly known as the swollen-stem euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a unique, swollen base that distinguishes it from other euphorbias. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens."
