    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the bentleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its distinctive, downward-curving leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
