    "intro": "Exallage pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a fuzzy appearance. The thallus, or body, of the lichen is typically crust-like, adhering tightly to its substrate. It is often found on bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments. This lichen plays a role in ecological succession and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
