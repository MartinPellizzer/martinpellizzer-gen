    "intro": "Elaterium, commonly known as the blister beetle, is a plant that is not actually a plant at all, but rather a type of insect. It is part of the family Meloidae and is known for secreting a toxic substance called cantharidin. This substance is used by the beetle as a defense mechanism against predators. The plant name Elaterium is sometimes mistakenly applied to the beetle due to historical confusion. Despite the misclassification, the blister beetle remains an important subject in both entomology and toxicology."
