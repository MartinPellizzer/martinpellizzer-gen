    "intro": "Elatostema pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elatostemaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Elatostema pulchellum is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical climates."
