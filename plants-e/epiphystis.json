    "intro": "Epiphystis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Epiphystis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
