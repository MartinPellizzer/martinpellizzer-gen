It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
