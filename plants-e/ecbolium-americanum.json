    "intro": "Ecbolium americanum, commonly known as the American burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny, pod-like fruits that cling to passing animals. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread via its persistent seed pods."
