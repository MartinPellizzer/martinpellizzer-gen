    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. hypoleium, commonly known as the lowleaf filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The showy pink to red flowers appear in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
