    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. pumila, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has ornamental value."
