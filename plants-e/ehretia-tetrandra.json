It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
