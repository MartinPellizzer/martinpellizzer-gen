    "intro": "Encyclia conspicua, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
