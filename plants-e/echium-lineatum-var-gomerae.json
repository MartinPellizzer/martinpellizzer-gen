    "intro": "Echium lineatum var. gomerae, commonly known as the Gomera thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
