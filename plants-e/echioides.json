    "intro": "Echioides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that are often blue or purple in color. Echioides species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty and windy conditions. Their leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
