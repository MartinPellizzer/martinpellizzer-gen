It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes as its fruit type. Davidson's buckwheat plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
