    "intro": "Eragrostis petraea, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis petraea is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments, often growing on slopes and in crevices where other plants struggle to establish. Its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
