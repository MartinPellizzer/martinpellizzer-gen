    "intro": "Euphorbia ruegeliana, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a waxy coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant landscapes."
