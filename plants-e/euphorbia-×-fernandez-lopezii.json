    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 fernandez-lopezii, commonly known as the hybrid spurges, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing tissues and reduced leaf surface. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, it can be toxic, with milky latex that may cause skin irritation."
