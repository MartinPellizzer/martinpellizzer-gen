    "intro": "Eurya membranacea, commonly known as the paperleaf evergreen holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thin, papery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
