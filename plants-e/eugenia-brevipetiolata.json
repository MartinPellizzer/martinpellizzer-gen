It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with short petioles, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers. Following flowering, it develops small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Its ornamental value and unique foliage make it a sought-after plant in horticulture."
