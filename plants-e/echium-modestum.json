    "intro": "Echium modestum, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces elongated, woody seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Echium modestum is also cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its oil-rich seeds used in various commercial applications."
