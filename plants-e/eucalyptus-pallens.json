It is characterized by its smooth, white or pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a whitish or blue-grey underside. It produces small, creamy-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
