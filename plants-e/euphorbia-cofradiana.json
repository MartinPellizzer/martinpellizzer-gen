    "intro": "Euphorbia cofradiana, commonly known as the Cofradia euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia cofradiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
