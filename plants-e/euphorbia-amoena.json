    "intro": "Euphorbia amoena, commonly known as the pink spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking pink or red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia amoena is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions."
