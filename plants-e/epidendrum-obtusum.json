    "intro": "Epidendrum obtusum, commonly known as the blunt epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum obtusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
