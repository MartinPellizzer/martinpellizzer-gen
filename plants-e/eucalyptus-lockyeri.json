    "intro": "Eucalyptus lockyeri, commonly known as the Lockyer's mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. Eucalyptus lockyeri is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
