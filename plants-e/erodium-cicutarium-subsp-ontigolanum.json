    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. ontigolanum, commonly known as the hairy erodium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers, which are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features make it identifiable by its distinctive hairy foliage and clustered inflorescences."
