    "intro": "Espeletia figueirasii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada tree heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white and purple. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Espeletia figueirasii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment."
