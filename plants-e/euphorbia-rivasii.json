    "intro": "Euphorbia rivasii, commonly known as the Rivas' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia rivasii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
