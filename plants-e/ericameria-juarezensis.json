    "intro": "Ericameria juarezensis, commonly known as the Ju\u00e1rez's ericoid, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish to golden composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ericameria juarezensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
