    "intro": "Elymus scaber, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Elymus scaber is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat for various insects and small animals."
