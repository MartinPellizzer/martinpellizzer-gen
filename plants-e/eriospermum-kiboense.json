    "intro": "Eriospermum kiboense, commonly known as the Kibo eriosperm, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves. Eriospermum kiboense is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
