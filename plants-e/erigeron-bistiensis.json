    "intro": "Erigeron bistiensis, commonly known as Bisti erigeron, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sand dunes and dry plains. It produces small white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
