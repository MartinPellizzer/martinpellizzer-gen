    "intro": "Epidendrum brassavoliforme, commonly known as the Brassavola orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy rhizomes and is known for its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces inflorescences that are often curved or arched, with petals and sepals that are usually similar in shape and size. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The Brassavola orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
