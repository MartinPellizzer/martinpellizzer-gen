    "intro": "Echinopsus, commonly known as the spiny holly or sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads, giving them a distinctive appearance. Echinopsus species are typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a striking visual effect when in bloom. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
