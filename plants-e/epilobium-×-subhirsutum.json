    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 subhirsutum, commonly known as the sticky willow or woolly willow, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in soft, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy surface. Epilobium \u00d7 subhirsutum is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and damp woodlands."
