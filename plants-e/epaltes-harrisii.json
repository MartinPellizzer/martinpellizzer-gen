It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are finely divided and often have a peppery scent when crushed, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
