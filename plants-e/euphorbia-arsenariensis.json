    "intro": "Euphorbia arsenariensis, commonly known as the arsenic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
