    "intro": "Encelia densifolia, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Encelia densifolia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
