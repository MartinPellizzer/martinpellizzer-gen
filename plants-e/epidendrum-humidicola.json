    "intro": "Epidendrum humidicola, commonly known as the wetland epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. The plant features long, arching stems with clustered, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or white. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Epidendrum humidicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
