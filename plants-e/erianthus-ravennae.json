    "intro": "Erianthus ravennae, commonly known as the Ravenna grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Erianthus ravennae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
