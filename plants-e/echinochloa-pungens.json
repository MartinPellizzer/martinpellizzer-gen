    "intro": "Echinochloa pungens, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, bristly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
