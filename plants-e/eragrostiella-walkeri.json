    "intro": "Eragrostiella walkeri, commonly known as the Walker's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Eragrostiella walkeri is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
