    "intro": "Erigeron bellidiastrum, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its silvery-gray foliage helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Erigeron bellidiastrum is often found in habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and desert scrub."
