    "intro": "Euonymus rosthornii var. crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. Its foliage provides seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
