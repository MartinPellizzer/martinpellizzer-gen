    "intro": "Eucalyptus mulleri, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Eucalyptus mulleri is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
