    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri var. major, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
