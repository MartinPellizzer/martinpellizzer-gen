    "intro": "Epipactis macropodia, commonly known as the large-lobed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, broad leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a lip that is often larger than the rest of the flower. Epipactis macropodia is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
