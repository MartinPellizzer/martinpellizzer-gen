    "intro": "Eucalyptus sweedmaniana, commonly known as the Western Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale yellow to cream, flowering from late winter to early spring. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. Eucalyptus sweedmaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
