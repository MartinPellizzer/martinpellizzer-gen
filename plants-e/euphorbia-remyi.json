    "intro": "Euphorbia remyi, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care."
