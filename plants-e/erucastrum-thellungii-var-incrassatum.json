    "intro": "Erucastrum thellungii var. incrassatum, commonly known as the thick-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
