It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for various ecological conditions. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional Aboriginal practices and have also been explored for their potential medicinal properties."
