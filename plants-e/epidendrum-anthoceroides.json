    "intro": "Epidendrum anthoceroides, commonly known as the \"Coral Epidendrum,\" is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum anthoceroides prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
