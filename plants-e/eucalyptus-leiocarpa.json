    "intro": "Eucalyptus leiocarpa, commonly known as the white box gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
