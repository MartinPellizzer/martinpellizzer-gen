    "intro": "Euphorbia deccanensis, commonly known as the Deccan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Deccan region of India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
