It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often blue or purple flowers. The plants typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy or rocky soils. Ebenus species are often found in regions with Mediterranean or desert climates. Their botanical features include hairy stems and leaves adapted to reduce water loss."
