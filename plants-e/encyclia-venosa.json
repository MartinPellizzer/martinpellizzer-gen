    "intro": "Encyclia venosa, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the dry season. Encyclia venosa is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
