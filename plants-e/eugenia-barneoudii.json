    "intro": "Eugenia barneoudii, commonly known as the Cameroon apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
