    "intro": "Encephalartos vangeertii, commonly known as the Vangeert's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. Encephalartos vangeertii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
