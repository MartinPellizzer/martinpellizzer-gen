    "intro": "Encelia microcephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and resinous properties. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and the leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. Encelia microcephala is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
