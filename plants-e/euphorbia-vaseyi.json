    "intro": "Euphorbia vaseyi, commonly known as the White Ghost Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and sparse, upright leaves that give it a unique, almost ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
