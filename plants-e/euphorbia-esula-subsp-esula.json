    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. esula, commonly known as leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of North America."
