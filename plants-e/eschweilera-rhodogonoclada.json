    "intro": "Eschweilera rhodogonoclada, commonly known as the pink-flowered sycamore, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by colorful bracts that give it its distinctive appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant ecological importance in its native region."
