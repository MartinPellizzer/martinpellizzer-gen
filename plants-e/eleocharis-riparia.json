    "intro": "Eleocharis riparia, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged or floating, contributing to its aquatic appearance. Eleocharis riparia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
