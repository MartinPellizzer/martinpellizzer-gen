    "intro": "Euadenia trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved euadenia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender pedicels and are often accompanied by a pleasant, subtle fragrance. Euadenia trifoliolata is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
