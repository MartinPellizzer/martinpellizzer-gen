    "intro": "Elymus farctus subsp. bessarabicus, commonly known as the Bessarabian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils, often forming part of the vegetation in semi-arid regions. Elymus farctus subsp. bessarabicus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
