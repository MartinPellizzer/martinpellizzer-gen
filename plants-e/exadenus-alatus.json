    "intro": "Exadenus alatus, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, contains cardiac glycosides. Exadenus alatus plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for specialized insects like the pipevine swallowtail butterfly."
