    "intro": "Encyclia boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in two rows along the stem. Encyclia boothiana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories."
