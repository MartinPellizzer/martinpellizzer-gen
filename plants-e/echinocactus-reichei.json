    "intro": "Echinocactus reichei, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and is often covered in spines that vary in color from yellow to red. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both ornamental and drought-resistant landscaping."
