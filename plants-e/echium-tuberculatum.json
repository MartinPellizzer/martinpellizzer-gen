    "intro": "Echium tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough echium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Echium tuberculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
