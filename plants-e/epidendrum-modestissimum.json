    "intro": "Epidendrum modestissimum, commonly known as the modest epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid that typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in tropical forest environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of brownish bark, which helps in water storage. Epidendrum modestissimum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for novice orchid growers."
