    "intro": "Eulophia coeloglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lip eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Eulophia coeloglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
