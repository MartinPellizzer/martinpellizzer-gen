    "intro": "Erodium arduinum, commonly known as the Italian bedstraw, is a small annual herb belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, prostrate stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy leaves and produces tiny, dry fruits called achenes. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its short life cycle and low-growing habit, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
