    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rapense, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Elaphoglossaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum rapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
