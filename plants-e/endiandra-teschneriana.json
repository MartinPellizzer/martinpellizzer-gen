It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland to mid-elevation forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
