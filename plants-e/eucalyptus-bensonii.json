    "intro": "Eucalyptus bensonii, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong lemon-like aroma. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Eucalyptus bensonii is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
