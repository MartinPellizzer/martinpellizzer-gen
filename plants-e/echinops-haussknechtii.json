    "intro": "Echinops haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of tightly packed bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of dry, woody fruits. Echinops haussknechtii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
