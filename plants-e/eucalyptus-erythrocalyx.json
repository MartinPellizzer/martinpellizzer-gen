    "intro": "Eucalyptus erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red calyx eucalyptus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pink or red in color, giving it its common name. Its flowers are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic, egg-shaped seeds. Eucalyptus erythrocalyx is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
