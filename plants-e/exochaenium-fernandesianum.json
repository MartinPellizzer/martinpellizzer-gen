    "intro": "Exochaenium fernandesianum, commonly known as the Mexican grass or fernandesean grass, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in its adaptation to arid environments. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
