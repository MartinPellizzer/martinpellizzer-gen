It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple or pinkish flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, seed-filled capsules. Eryngiophyllum rosei is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
