    "intro": "Euphorbia peplis, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense mat of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and can survive in arid environments."
