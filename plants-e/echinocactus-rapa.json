It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its fleshy stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Echinocactus rapa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
