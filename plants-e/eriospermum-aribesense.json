    "intro": "Eriospermum aribesense, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and branched, often growing close to the ground. Eriospermum aribesense is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
