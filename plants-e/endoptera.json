    "intro": "Endoptera, commonly known as insects with a complete metamorphosis, include species like butterflies, moths, and beetles. These insects undergo a dramatic transformation from egg to larva, pupa, and finally adult. The larval stage, often referred to as the caterpillar in butterflies and moths, is primarily responsible for feeding and growth. The pupal stage is a period of significant developmental change, during which the insect's body restructures. Botanically, endoptera play crucial roles in pollination and serve as food sources for various animals, making them ecologically significant."
