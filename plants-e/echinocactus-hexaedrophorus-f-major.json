    "intro": "Echinocactus hexaedrophorus f. major, commonly known as the giant card\u00f3n cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its massive, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in thick, ribbed structures. Its spines are typically yellowish to reddish, providing both protection and a means of reducing water loss. The plant produces large, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Due to its size and habitat requirements, it is a rare and protected species, often found in desert scrublands and rocky soils."
