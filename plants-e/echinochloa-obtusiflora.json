It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and can be invasive in agricultural settings. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
