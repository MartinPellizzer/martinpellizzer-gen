    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. hirtella, commonly known as hairy willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. Its leaves are hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
