    "intro": "Eremaea dendroidea, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red or brown fruits. Eremaea dendroidea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and salt-laden soils. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive feature of the Australian landscape."
