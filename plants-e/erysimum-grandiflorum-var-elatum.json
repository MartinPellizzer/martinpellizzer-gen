    "intro": "Erysimum grandiflorum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall wallflower, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This variety is known for its larger flowers compared to the typical species, making it a striking addition to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
