    "intro": "Eugenia heringeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark purple, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain ecosystems."
