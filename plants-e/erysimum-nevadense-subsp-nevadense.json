    "intro": "Erysimum nevadense subsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution within Nevada."
