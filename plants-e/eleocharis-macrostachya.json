    "intro": "Eleocharis macrostachya, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that bear dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale brown flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Eleocharis macrostachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions."
