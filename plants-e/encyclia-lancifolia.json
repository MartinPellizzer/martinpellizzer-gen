It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps.
