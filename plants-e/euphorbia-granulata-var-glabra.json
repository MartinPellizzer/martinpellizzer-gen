    "intro": "Euphorbia granulata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems covered in a smooth, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structures. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions."
