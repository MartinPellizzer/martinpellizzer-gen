    "intro": "Echinocactus tenuispinus var. minor, commonly known as the small-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a rounded, ribbed stem that is typically green to blue-green in color, with a dense covering of short, spiny bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
