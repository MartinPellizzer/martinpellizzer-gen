    "intro": "Euphorbia congenera, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The sap of Euphorbia congenera is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
