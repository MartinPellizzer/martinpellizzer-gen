    "intro": "Elytrigia hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's timothy, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Elytrigia hoffmannii is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in wet areas."
