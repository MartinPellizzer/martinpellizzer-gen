It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often surrounded by bracts. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
