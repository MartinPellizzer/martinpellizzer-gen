    "intro": "Euphorbia vulcanorum, commonly known as the Vulcan's spurge, is a unique plant native to the volcanic soils of Italy. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid, nutrient-poor environments, making it well adapted to volcanic landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
