    "intro": "Epidendrum platychilum, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platychilum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
