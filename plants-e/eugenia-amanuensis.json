    "intro": "Eugenia amanuensis, commonly known as the Amanuensis clove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small, fleshy berry, contains several seeds and is often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
