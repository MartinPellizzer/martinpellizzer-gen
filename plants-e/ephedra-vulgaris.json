    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris, commonly known as the jointfir, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red or orange berries, which are adapted to disperse in dry environments. Ephedra vulgaris contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
