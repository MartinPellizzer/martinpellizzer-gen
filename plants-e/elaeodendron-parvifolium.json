    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elaeidendron parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf elaeodendron, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
