    "intro": "Erica adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Erica adunca is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in full sun. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
