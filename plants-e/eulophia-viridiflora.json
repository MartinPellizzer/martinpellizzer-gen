    "intro": "Eulophia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, making it a visually appealing species. Eulophia viridiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and botanical collections."
