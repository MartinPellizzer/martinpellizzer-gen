    "intro": "Euphorbia thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem system with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems and leaves. Euphorbia thompsonii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
