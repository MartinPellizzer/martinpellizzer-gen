    "intro": "Equisetum diffusum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils near water sources. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called sterile leaves. Its stems are typically green and hollow, containing a central cavity filled with air. This species is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
