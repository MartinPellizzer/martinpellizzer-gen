    "intro": "Excoecaria diandra, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Excoecaria diandra plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
