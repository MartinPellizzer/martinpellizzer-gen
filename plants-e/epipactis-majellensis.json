    "intro": "Epipactis majellensis, commonly known as the Majelline orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and slender, upright stems. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
