    "intro": "Echium rosmarinifolium, commonly known as the common fleabane, is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that resemble rosemary foliage. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Echium rosmarinifolium is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
