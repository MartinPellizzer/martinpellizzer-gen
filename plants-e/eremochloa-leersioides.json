    "intro": "Eremochloa leersioides, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils and access deep water sources. Eremochloa leersioides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
