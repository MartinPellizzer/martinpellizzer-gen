It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation programs."
