    "intro": "Epidendrum phymatoglossum, commonly known as the velvet lip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are borne on long, arching inflorescences, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
