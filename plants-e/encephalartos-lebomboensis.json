    "intro": "Encephalartos lebomboensis, commonly known as the Lebombo cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in subtropical regions with a warm, dry climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
