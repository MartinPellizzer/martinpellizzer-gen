    "intro": "Ervum tetraspermum var. tenue, commonly known as slender four-seeded vetch, is a variant of the vetch genus native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and pea-like, typical of the Fabaceae family, and the plant produces four-seeded pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has potential for use in ecological restoration projects."
