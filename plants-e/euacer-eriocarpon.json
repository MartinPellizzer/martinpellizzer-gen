    "intro": "Euacer eriocarpon, commonly known as the woolly acanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system and can thrive in well-drained soils. Its hairy, glandular leaves give it a fuzzy appearance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Euacer eriocarpon is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
