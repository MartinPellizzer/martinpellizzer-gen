It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
