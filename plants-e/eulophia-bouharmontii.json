    "intro": "Eulophia bouharmontii, commonly known as the Bouharmont's eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces inflorescences with showy, white to pale yellow petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
