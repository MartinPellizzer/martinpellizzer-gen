    "intro": "Erythroxylum rimosum, commonly known as the creeping erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into orange-red berries, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is related to the coca plant. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
