It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis acuta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
