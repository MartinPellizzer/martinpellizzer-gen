    "intro": "Euphorbia jucula, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, colorful bracts that resemble coral, giving it its common name. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia jucula is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in dry conditions."
