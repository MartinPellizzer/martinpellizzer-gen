    "intro": "Efossus zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas efossus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Zacatecas, Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a rosette-forming structure, allowing it to store water efficiently in its leaves. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Efossus zacatecasensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
