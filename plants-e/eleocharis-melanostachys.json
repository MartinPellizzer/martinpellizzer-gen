    "intro": "Eleocharis melanostachys, commonly known as black-stalked sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear dark brown to black flowers, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Eleocharis melanostachys plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
