    "intro": "[WRONG START] Eremogone ledeburiana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eremogone ledeburiana is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems and a waxy cuticle to minimize evaporation."
