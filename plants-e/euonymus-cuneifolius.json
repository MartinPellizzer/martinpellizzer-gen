    "intro": "Euonymus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for hedges and topiaries. The plant is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
