    "intro": "Euryops decumbens, commonly known as the golden bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, characterized by its prostrate or sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euryops decumbens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
