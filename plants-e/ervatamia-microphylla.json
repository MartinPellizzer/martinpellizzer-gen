    "intro": "Ervatamia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Ervatamia microphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
