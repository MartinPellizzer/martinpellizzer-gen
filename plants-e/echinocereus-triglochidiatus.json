    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for hosting the plant's defensive spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
