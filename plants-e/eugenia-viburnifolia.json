    "intro": "Eugenia viburnifolia, commonly known as the panama rose or panama hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers, which are followed by ornamental, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Eugenia viburnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
