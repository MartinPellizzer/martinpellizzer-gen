    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri subsp. medium, commonly known as the medium tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and sometimes slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
