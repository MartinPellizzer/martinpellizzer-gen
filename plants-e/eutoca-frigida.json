    "intro": "Eutoca frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, typically found in cloud forests. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to climate change, Eutoca frigida is considered a vulnerable species."
