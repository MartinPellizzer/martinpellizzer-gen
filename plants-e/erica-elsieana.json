    "intro": "Erica elsieana, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter, adding a delicate beauty to the landscape. Erica elsieana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
