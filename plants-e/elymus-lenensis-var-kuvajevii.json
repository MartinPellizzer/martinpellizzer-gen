    "intro": "Elymus lenensis var. kuvajevii, commonly known as the Kuvajevii wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and low-nutrient conditions. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas."
