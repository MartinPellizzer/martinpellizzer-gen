    "intro": "Erica longifolia var. squarrosa, commonly known as the square-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Erica longifolia var. squarrosa is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
