    "intro": "Epidendrum alpicolonigrense, commonly known as the Alpine Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, featuring a short, thick stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, arranged in racemes. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
