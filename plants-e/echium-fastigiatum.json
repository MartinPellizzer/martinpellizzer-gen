    "intro": "Echium fastigiatum, commonly known as the purple evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, elongated seed pod that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Echium fastigiatum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
