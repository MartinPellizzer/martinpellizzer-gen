    "intro": "Epipactis veratrifolia var. oaseana, commonly known as the Oasean helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking, hooded flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple throat, and it produces small, round, greenish fruits. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in calcareous soils."
