    "intro": "Echinocereus fasciculatus subsp. bonkerae, commonly known as the Bonkerae prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with dense clusters of spiny stems. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
