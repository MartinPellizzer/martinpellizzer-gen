    "intro": "Erica senilis var. senilis, commonly known as the silver leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
