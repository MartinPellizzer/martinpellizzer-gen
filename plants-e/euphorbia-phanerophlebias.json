    "intro": "Euphorbia phanerophlebias, commonly known as the showy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which are modified leaves. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
