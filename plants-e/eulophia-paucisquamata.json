    "intro": "Eulophia paucisquamata, commonly known as the few-scaled eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a few pairs of fleshy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in a raceme, often with a distinctive white or pale yellow coloration. The species is noted for its unique leaf structure, which includes a reduced number of leaf scales, giving it its common name."
