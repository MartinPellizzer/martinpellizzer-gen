    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lanceolate fronds with finely toothed margins and hairy structures on the underside of its leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
