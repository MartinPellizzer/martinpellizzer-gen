    "intro": "Euphorbia calabarica, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The sap of Euphorbia calabarica is toxic and can cause skin irritation, requiring caution during handling."
