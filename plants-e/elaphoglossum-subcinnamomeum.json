    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subcinnamomeum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cinnamon-scented fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum subcinnamomeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
