    "intro": "Eriostoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with five petals. Eriostoma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are often found in wetland or disturbed habitats, and some species are considered invasive in certain areas."
