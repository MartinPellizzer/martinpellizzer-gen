    "intro": "Erica mollissima, commonly known as the silky heath, is a shrub native to the western regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and its clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like, evergreen leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Erica mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
