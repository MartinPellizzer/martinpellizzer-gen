    "intro": "Erysimum incanum var. kunzeanum, commonly known as the desert wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
