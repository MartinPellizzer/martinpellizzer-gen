    "intro": "Euphorbia psittacorum, commonly known as the parrot's beak, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, greenish-yellow bracts that resemble a parrot's beak, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia psittacorum is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
