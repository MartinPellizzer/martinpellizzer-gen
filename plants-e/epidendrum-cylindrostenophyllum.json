It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
