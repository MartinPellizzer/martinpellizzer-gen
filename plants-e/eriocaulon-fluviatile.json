    "intro": "Eriocaulon fluviatile, commonly known as the river marsh grass, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Eriocaulon fluviatile plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
