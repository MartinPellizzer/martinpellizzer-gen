    "intro": "Euphorbia glomerulans, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
