    "intro": "Espeletia tillettii, commonly known as the Tiltlet's heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Espeletia tillettii is also noted for its ability to form clonal colonies, contributing to its resilience in mountainous regions."
