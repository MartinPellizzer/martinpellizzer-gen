    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei subsp. villosa, commonly known as the Woolly Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale green hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
