    "intro": "Euphorbia columnaris, commonly known as the columnar euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically hidden within a spiny structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique, architectural appearance. Euphorbia columnaris is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
