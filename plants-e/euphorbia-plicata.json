    "intro": "Euphorbia plicata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and smooth, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open fields. Euphorbia plicata is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
