    "intro": "Epidendrum amblostomoides, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the branches of longleaf pines in the Florida Panhandle. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, showy white or pale green flower that lacks petals. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is highly vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to survive."
