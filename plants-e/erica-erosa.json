    "intro": "Erica erosa, commonly known as the sand heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its profusion of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Erica erosa is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
