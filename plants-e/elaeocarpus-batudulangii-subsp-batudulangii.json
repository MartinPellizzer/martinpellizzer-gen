    "intro": "Elaeocarpus batudulangii subsp. batudulangii, commonly known as the Batudulangii Elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fleshy fruits that are often red or purple in color. It has a relatively short stature, usually growing as a shrub or small tree, and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
