    "intro": "Echium monstrosum, commonly known as the giant purple coneflower, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that persists through the winter, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. Echium monstrosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
