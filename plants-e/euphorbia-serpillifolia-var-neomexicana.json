    "intro": "Euphorbia serpillifolia var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
