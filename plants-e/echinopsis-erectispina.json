    "intro": "Echinopsis erectispina, commonly known as the erect-spined echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Echinopsis erectispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
