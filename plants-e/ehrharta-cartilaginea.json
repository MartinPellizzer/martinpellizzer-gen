It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance. Ehrharta cartilaginea is also valued for its role in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
