It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody pods containing hard, angular seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and seeds contain alkaloids, making it both economically and medicinally significant. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
