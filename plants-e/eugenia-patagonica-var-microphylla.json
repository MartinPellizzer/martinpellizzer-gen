    "intro": "Eugenia patagonica var. microphylla, commonly known as the Patagonian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers give way to small, round berries that are edible but often used in local traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters."
