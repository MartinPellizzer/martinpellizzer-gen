It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors from white to pink. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a glossy upper surface. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
