The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in globular inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. This variety is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in moist, cool environments with well-drained soil. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
