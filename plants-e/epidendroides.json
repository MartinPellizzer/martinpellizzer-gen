    "intro": "Epidendroides, commonly known as the orchid genus, is a diverse group of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. They typically have elongated, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors. Epidendroides species are often epiphytic, growing on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Their complex floral structures and adaptability make them popular among horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts."
