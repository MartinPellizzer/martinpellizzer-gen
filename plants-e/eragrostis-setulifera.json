    "intro": "Eragrostis setulifera, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, bristly hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. Eragrostis setulifera is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
