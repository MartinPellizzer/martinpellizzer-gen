    "intro": "Euonymus acuminifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leafed woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath, with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded gardens."
