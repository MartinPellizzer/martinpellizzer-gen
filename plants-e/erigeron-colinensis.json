    "intro": "Erigeron colinensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Erigeron colinensis is an important component of native plant communities and supports a variety of pollinators."
