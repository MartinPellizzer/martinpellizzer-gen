    "intro": "Epilobium obscurum var. pseudopalustre, commonly known as the bog willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of streams. The plant features slender, often reddish stems that are often covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. This variant is distinguished by its preference for more acidic and saturated soil conditions compared to the typical form of Epilobium obscurum."
