    "intro": "Epilobium nitidum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Epilobium nitidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
