    "intro": "Excavatia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Cave Plant, is a rare epiphytic species native to the tropical rainforests of Vanuatu. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often tuberous roots that help it absorb moisture from the humid air. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, adapting to low-light conditions with its broad, waxy leaves. Its flowering is rare and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy but are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments."
