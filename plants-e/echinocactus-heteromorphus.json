    "intro": "Echinocactus heteromorphus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spines and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for xeriscaping."
