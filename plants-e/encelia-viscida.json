    "intro": "Encelia viscida, commonly known as the sticky encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology helps it conserve water and resist herbivory. Encelia viscida plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
