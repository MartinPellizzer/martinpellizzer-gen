    "intro": "Elaphoglossum proximum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows along the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum proximum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
