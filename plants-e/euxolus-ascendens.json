    "intro": "Euxolus ascendens, commonly known as the ascending euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a bushy form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by unique, spherical seed capsules. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic common in many succulents. Euxolus ascendens is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem to survive dry conditions."
