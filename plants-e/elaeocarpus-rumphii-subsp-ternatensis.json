    "intro": "Elaeocarpus rumphii subsp. ternatensis, commonly known as the Ternate elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The fruit is a woody, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Elaeocarpaceae family. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
