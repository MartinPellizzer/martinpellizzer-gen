    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum, commonly known as the tall horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Equisetum praealtum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plants on Earth."
