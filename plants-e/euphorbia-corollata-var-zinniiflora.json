It features upright, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. The species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
