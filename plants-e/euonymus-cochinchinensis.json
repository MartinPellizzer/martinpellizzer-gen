    "intro": "Euonymus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cercidiphyllaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
