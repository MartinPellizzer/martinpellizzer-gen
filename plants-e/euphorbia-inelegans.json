    "intro": "Euphorbia inelegans, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Euphorbia inelegans is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
