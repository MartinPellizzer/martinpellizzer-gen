    "intro": "Eucalyptus muelleriana, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a vibrant yellow-green color beneath. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue with prominent veins. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
