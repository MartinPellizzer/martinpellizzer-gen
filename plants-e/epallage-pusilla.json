    "intro": "Epallage pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf epallage, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which are often violet or purple in color, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epallage pusilla is considered a rare and endangered species."
