    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus f. cordatus, commonly known as the cordate euonymus, is a cultivar of the genus Euonymus, characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. Its foliage provides ornamental value, making it a popular choice for garden use. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
