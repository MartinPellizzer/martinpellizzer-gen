    "intro": "Echinocactus lewinii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, segmented stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and bloom at the top of the stem. Echinocactus lewinii is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance."
