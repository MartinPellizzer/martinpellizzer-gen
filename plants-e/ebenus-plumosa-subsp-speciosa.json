    "intro": "Ebenus plumosa subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the showy feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that adds to its visual appeal. It is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
