It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a hedge plant."
