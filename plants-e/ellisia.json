    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elliisia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Ellisia species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
