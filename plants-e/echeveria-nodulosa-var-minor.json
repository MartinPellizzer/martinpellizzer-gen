    "intro": "Echeveria nodulosa var. minor, commonly known as the miniature echeveria or dwarf echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a powdery coating, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is popular among succulent enthusiasts for rock gardens and container planting."
