    "intro": "Euphorbia troyana, commonly known as the Troyan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a branched stem with a thick, fleshy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often spiny, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia troyana is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
