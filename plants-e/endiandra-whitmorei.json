    "intro": "Endiandra whitmorei, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Endiandra whitmorei is considered an endangered species."
