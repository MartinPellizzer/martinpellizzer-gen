    "intro": "Ectrosia nervilemma, commonly known as the narrow-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves with prominent veins and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its berries. Ectrosia nervilemma plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
