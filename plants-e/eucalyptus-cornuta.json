    "intro": "Eucalyptus cornuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The tree produces small, globular flower buds that are typically tinged with yellow or red, which later open to reveal white or pink flowers. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Eucalyptus cornuta is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought and fire."
