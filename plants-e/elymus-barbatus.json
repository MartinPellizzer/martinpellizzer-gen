    "intro": "Elymus barbatus, commonly known as bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted inflorescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets with bracts that are often hairy or barbed, contributing to its common name. Elymus barbatus is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
