    "intro": "Erigeron inornatus var. calidipetris, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and maritime habitats. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
