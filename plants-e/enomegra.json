    "intro": "Enomegra, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, often pink or purple, flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The genus is characterized by its fibrous stems and hairy foliage, which help it adapt to arid environments."
