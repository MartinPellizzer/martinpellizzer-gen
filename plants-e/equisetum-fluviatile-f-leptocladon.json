It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. This fern thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. The plant has a distinctive appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
