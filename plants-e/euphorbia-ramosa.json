    "intro": "Euphorbia ramosa, commonly known as the branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Euphorbia ramosa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
