    "intro": "Eriochloa parvispiculata, commonly known as small-bristle panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, bristled lemma hairs, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
