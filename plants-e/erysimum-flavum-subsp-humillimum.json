    "intro": "Erysimum flavum subsp. humillimum, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats like slopes and cliffs. Its compact form and vibrant color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more delicate foliage compared to other Erysimum species."
