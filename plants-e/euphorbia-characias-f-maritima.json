    "intro": "Euphorbia characias f. maritima, commonly known as the sea spurge or coastal euphorbia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping."
