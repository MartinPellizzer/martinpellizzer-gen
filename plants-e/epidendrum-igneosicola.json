    "intro": "Epidendrum igneosicola, commonly known as the fiery stick orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, wiry stems covered in dense, velvety foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and unique growth form, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare orchids."
