    "intro": "Exothea, commonly known as the \"bushy tree\" or \"false mahogany,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Exothea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and riverbanks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
