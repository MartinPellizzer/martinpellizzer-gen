It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique texture and visual appeal."
