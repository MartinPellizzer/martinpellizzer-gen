    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenkoan fescue, is a hybrid grass species native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cold, alpine environments with well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
