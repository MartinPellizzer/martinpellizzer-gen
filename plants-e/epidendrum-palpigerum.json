    "intro": "Epidendrum palpigerum, commonly known as the velvet epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping stems and clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture. Epidendrum palpigerum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
