It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature, containing several seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aromatic foliage and showy blooms. Eugenia polycarpa is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
