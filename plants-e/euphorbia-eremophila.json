    "intro": "Euphorbia eremophila, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss. Euphorbia eremophila is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
