    "intro": "Ervum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flower vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, it plays a valuable part in soil enrichment and habitat support for various insects."
