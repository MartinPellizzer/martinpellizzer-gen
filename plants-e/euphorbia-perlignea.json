    "intro": "Euphorbia perlignea, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, woody stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and may be either opposite or alternate in arrangement. Euphorbia perlignea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
