    "intro": "Epidendrum magnificum, commonly known as the magnificent orchid, is a striking species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces large, showy flowers in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, and green, with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Epidendrum magnificum is well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
