    "intro": "Eugenia leonensis, commonly known as the Cuban huito, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit, a small, yellowish berry, is edible and has a sweet, slightly acidic flavor, making it a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. Eugenia leonensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
