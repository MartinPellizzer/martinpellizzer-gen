    "intro": "Euphorbia cozumelensis, commonly known as Cozumel spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Cozumel in the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought. Euphorbia cozumelensis is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
