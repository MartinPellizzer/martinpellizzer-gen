    "intro": "Echinocactus famatinensis, commonly known as the Famatinian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its structure includes areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. This cactus is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
