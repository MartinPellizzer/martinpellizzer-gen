    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a variant of the common cottongrass found in northern regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as marshes and tundra. Its narrow foliage distinguishes it from the broader-leaved form of the same species. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
