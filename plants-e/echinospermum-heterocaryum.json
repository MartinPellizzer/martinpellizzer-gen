    "intro": "Echinospermum heterocaryum, commonly known as the roughleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny, echinated capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
