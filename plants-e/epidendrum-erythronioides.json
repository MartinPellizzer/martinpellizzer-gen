    "intro": "Epidendrum erythronioides, commonly known as the Red-veined Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with yellow lips, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum erythronioides is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
