    "intro": "Euphorbia polytimetica, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
