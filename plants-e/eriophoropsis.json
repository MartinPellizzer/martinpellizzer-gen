    "intro": "Eriophoropsis, commonly known as the eriophoropsis gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Eriophoridae. It is primarily known for inducing galls on the leaves of various woody plants, particularly species within the genus *Prunus*. The larvae of these insects feed on plant tissues, causing abnormal growth that forms distinctive galls. These galls provide protection and nourishment for the developing larvae. The plant's response to the insect's feeding results in unique morphological changes, making Eriophoropsis an important subject in the study of plant-insect interactions."
