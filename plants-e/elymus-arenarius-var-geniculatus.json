    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. geniculatus, commonly known as the sand reedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with glumes that are often shorter than the lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and wind. This variant is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils, making it an important component of stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
