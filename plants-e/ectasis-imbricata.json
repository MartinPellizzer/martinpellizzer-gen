    "intro": "Ectasis imbricata, commonly known as the overlapping leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, overlapping leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread over other plants. Ectasis imbricata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
