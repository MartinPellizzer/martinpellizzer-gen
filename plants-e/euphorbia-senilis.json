    "intro": "Euphorbia senilis, commonly known as the tree of life, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem that resembles a tree, with a central trunk and multiple limbs. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are usually gray-green in color, and it produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Euphorbia senilis is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
