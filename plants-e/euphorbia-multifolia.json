    "intro": "Euphorbia multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, woody stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
