    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule var. aureum, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
