    "intro": "Einomeia pentandra, commonly known as the five-angled sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
