It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
