    "intro": "Escobaria nellieae, commonly known as the Nellie's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Escobaria nellieae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting desert biodiversity."
