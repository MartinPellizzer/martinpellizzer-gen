    "intro": "Erysimum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Erysimum lasiocarpum is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to harsh, dry conditions."
