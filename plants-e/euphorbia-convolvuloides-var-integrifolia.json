    "intro": "Euphorbia convolvuloides var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have smooth margins, distinguishing it from other euphorbia species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf-like structure called a cyathium. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open areas."
