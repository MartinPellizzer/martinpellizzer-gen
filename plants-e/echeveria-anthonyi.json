It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant purple-pink flowers on tall stalks during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
