    "intro": "Eurybia axillaris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eurybia axillaris is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky outcrops."
