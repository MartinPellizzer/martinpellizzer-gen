    "intro": "Echium pomponium, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and erect. Echium pomponium is often considered a weed but has ornamental value in gardens."
