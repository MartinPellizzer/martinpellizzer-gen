    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus f. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, ribbed spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
