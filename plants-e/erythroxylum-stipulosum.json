It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish in color, which give it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
