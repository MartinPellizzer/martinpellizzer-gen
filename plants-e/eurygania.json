    "intro": "Eurygania, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has woody stems and produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Eurygania plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
