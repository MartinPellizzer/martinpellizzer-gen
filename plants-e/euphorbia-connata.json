    "intro": "Euphorbia connata, commonly known as the Florida spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are grouped in clusters called cyathia. The plant produces a milky latex when its stems are broken, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Euphorbia connata is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
