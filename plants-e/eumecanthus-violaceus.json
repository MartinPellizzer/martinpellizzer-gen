    "intro": "Eumecanthus violaceus, commonly known as the violet-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet petals and a unique floral structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
