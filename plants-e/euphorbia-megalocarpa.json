    "intro": "Euphorbia megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant African milk bush, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces large, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care. Euphorbia megalocarpa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
