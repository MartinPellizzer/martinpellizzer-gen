    "intro": "Englerodaphne ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and incense. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
