    "intro": "Euphorbia friesii, commonly known as the Fries' spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia friesii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
