    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-resistant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its succulent nature, it requires minimal water and is suitable for arid garden environments."
