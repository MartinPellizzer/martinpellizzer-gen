    "intro": "Epidendrum pleurotallipnevma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent white lips, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This epiphytic orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
