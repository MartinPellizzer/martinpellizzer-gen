    "intro": "Eulophia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its single, elongated leaf and a compact inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Eulophia monophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
