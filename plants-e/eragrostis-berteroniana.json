    "intro": "Eragrostis berteroniana, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Eragrostis berteroniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
