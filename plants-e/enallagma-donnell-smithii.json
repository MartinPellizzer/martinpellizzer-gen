    "intro": "Enallagma donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's dragonfly, is a species of damselfly native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Coenagrionidae and is characterized by its slender body and elongated wings. The plant-like appearance of its nymph stage, which lives in freshwater habitats, is a key feature in its ecological role. Enallagma donnell-smithii thrives in still or slow-moving waters with dense vegetation, which provides both shelter and breeding sites. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water in its habitat."
