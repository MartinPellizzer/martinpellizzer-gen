    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum ambiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
