    "intro": "Eucalyptus delicata, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a creamy-white or pale grey underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing small, brown seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate."
