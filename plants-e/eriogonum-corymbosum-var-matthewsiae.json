    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. matthewsiae, commonly known as the Matthew's' buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. This variety thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and coastal scrub habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
