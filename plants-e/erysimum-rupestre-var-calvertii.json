    "intro": "Erysimum rupestre var. calvertii, commonly known as Calvert's wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
