    "intro": "Euphorbia rubens, commonly known as the red spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia rubens is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
