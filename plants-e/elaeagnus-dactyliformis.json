    "intro": "Elaeagnus dactyliformis, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Elaeagnus dactyliformis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
