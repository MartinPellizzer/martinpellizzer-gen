    "intro": "Erysimum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed wallflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine teeth. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in rocky habitats. Erysimum denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its cheerful blooms."
