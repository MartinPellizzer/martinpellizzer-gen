    "intro": "Elettaria tomentosa, commonly known as cardamom, is a tropical perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped rhizomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed, red-brown capsules containing aromatic seeds. Cardamom is valued for its strong, sweet scent and is widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Its botanical features make it a significant crop in regions with humid climates and well-drained soils."
