    "intro": "Elytrigia lolioides var. ciliolatum, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy texture, and the grass produces small, spike-like flowers in late spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
