    "intro": "Eurybia moschata, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often prostrate or upright depending on the variety. Eurybia moschata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
