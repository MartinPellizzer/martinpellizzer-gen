    "intro": "Eugenioides estrellense, commonly known as Estrellan Eugenia, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dark purple berry that is edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
