    "intro": "Erica palustris, commonly known as the marsh heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of Europe. It typically thrives in acidic, sandy or peaty soils and is often found in wet or marshy habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like and dark green, contributing to its dense, compact appearance. Erica palustris is well adapted to coastal and heathland environments, often forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various wildlife species."
