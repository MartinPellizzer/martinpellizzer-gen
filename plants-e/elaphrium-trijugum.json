    "intro": "Elaphrium trijugum, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it its scientific name. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its unique morphology and predatory behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical and ecological study."
