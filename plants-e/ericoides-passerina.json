    "intro": "Ericoides passerina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded forest environments. Its wood is valued for its durability and unique reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many areas."
