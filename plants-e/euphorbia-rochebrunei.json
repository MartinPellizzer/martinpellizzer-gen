    "intro": "Euphorbia rochebrunei, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
