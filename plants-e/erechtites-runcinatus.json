    "intro": "Erechtites runcinatus, commonly known as the slender tickseed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective plant for erosion control in wetland environments."
