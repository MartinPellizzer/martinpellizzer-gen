    "intro": "Erepsia compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf erica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erepsia compressa is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with a dormant period during the summer months."
