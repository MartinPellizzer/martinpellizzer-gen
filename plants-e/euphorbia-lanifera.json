    "intro": "Euphorbia lanifera, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
