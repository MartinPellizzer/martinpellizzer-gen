    "intro": "Excoecaria aporusifolia, commonly known as the creeping coral tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red and orange. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant blooms. However, it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
