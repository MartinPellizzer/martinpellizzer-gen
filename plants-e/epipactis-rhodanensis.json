    "intro": "Epipactis rhodanensis, commonly known as the Rhodanese helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis rhodanensis is a perennial species that produces a large, spurred lip on its flower, a feature common among orchids."
