    "intro": "Euphorbia bivonae subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid climates."
