    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. herbaceum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, needle-like spines. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are rich in silica, making them tough and abrasive. This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats across temperate regions."
