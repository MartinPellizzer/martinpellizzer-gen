    "intro": "Euphorbia ingenticapsa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
