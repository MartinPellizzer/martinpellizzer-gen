    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian willow or creeping willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that can form dense mats, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or wetland areas. Epilobium \u00d7 syriacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
