    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf horse tail, is a compact fern-like plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves and a slender, unbranched stem. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. The plant exhibits a unique combination of primitive and advanced features, making it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
