    "intro": "Eriogonum rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Eriogonum rosulatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
