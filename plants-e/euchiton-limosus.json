    "intro": "Euchiton limosus, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy pink or purple flowers during the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Euchiton limosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
