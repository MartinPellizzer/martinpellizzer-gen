    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. humile, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum \u00d7 humile. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves and has a distinctive, jointed stem that is often ribbed. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are adapted for dispersal in coastal environments. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and its ability to thrive in challenging maritime conditions."
