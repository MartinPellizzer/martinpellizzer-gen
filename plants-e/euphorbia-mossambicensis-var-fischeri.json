    "intro": "Euphorbia mossambicensis var. fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, a characteristic defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
