It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, spherical flower buds that are often white or pale blue in color. It is a shrub or small tree that plays a significant role in the ecological systems of its habitat. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of native plant communities."
