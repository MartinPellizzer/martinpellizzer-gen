    "intro": "Enosanthes virgata, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped lip, which is a hallmark of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate flowers bloom in late spring, adding a unique beauty to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Enosanthes virgata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
