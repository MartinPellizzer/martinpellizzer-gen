It features a woody stem with a distinctive yellowish-green bark and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. The plant has milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
