    "intro": "Euphorbia equisetiformis, commonly known as the horse-tail spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a spiny, branched stem that resembles the horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to scale-like structures. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia equisetiformis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes."
