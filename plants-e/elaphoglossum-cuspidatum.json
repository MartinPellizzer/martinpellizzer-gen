It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum cuspidatum is native to regions of the Americas, including parts of the southeastern United States."
