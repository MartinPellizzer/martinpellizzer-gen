    "intro": "Erica mollis, commonly known as the Heath Erica, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Erica mollis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
