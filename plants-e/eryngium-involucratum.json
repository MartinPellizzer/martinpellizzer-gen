    "intro": "Eryngium involucratum, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spiky flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a cup-like involucre, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eryngium involucratum thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks."
