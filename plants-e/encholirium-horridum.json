    "intro": "Encholirium horridum, commonly known as the horrid cardoon, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its robust structure and unique appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
