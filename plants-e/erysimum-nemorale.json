    "intro": "Erysimum nemorale, commonly known as the woodland wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a compact, low-growing habit. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow and arranged in clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Erysimum nemorale is often found in rocky soils and is relatively hardy, making it a resilient species in woodland ecosystems."
