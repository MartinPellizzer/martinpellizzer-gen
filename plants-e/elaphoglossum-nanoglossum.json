    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nanoglossum, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in understory plant communities."
