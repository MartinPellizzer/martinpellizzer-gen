    "intro": "Escobaria tuberculosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
