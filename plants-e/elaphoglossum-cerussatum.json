    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cerussatum, commonly known as the leadplant fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across North America. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum cerussatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
