It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, spiny tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in cactus gardens and collections."
