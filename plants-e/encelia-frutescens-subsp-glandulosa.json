    "intro": "Encelia frutescens subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular brittlebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, glandular-armed leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species adapted to harsh climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced glandular structures on the leaves compared to other subspecies of Encelia frutescens."
