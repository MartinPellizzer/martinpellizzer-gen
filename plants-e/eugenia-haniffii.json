    "intro": "Eugenia haniffii, commonly known as the Haniff\u2019s guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
