    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri subsp. flaminia, commonly known as the Flaminian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, elliptical seeds. This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to other members of the Epipactis genus, making it challenging to distinguish without close examination."
