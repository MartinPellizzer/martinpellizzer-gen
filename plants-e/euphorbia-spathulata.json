    "intro": "Euphorbia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features succulent, broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
