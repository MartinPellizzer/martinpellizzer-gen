It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-white foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
