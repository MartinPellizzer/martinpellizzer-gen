    "intro": "Eupatorium serratum var. confertum, commonly known as rough skeletonweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its stems are often branched and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many familiar flowering plants."
