It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, branched panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red or yellow when mature. Eugenia paniculiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
