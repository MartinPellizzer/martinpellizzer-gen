    "intro": "Elymus zhui, commonly known as the Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that contributes to its distinctive appearance. Elymus zhui is also valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
