    "intro": "Epidendrum golondrinense, commonly known as the Blue Butterfly Orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, moist conditions. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
