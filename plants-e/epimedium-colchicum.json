    "intro": "Epimedium colchicum, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium colchicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
