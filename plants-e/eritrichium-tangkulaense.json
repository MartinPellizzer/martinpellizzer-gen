    "intro": "Eritrichium tangkulaense, commonly known as the Tangkula alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant grows in rocky and alpine environments, often at elevations above 4,000 meters. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
