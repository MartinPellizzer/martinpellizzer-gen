    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus crispatus f. heteracanthus, commonly known as the crinkled spine cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its ribbed, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections or protected areas."
