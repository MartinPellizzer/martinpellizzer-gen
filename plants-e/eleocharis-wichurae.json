    "intro": "Eleocharis wichurae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
