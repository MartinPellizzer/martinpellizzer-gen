    "intro": "Epidendrum pulchellum, commonly known as the Pink Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
