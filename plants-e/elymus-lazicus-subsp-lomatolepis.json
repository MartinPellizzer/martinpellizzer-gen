    "intro": "Elymus lazicus subsp. lomatolepis, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with lemmas that are rough and hairy. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
