    "intro": "Epilobium lapponicum, commonly known as Arctic willow or Lapland willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the short growing season of its habitat. Epilobium lapponicum is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
