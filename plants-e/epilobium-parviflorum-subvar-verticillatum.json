    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum subvar. verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The flowers are small, pink or purple, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, giving it its common name. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
