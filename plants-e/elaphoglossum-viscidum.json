    "intro": "Elaphoglossum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a sticky surface that gives it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often curled or rolled. Elaphoglossum viscidum is a low-growing plant that contributes to the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
