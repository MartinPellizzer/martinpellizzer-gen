    "intro": "Euphorbia auricularia, commonly known as the earleaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, ear-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Euphorbia auricularia is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
