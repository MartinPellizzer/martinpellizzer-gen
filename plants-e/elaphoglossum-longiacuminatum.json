    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longiacuminatum, commonly known as the long-awned harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, elongated awn at the tip of each pinna. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of the southeastern United States."
