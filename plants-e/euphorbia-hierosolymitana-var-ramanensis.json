    "intro": "Euphorbia hierosolymitana var. ramanensis, commonly known as the Raman's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
