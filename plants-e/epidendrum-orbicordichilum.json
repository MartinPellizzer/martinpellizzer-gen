    "intro": "Epidendrum orbicordichilum, commonly known as the red-flowered epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-shaded habitats. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting lip that attracts pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in tropical orchids."
