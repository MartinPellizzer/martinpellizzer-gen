    "intro": "Elymus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus sikkimensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
