    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. rugosus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover ground. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural areas."
