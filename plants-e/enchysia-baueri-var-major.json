    "intro": "Enchysia baueri var. major, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important plant in its native habitat."
