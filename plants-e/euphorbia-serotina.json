    "intro": "Euphorbia serotina, commonly known as late euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and alternate, simple leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Euphorbia serotina is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant and well-adapted to arid conditions."
