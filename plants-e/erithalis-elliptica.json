    "intro": "Erithalis elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf erithalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features alternate, elliptic-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Erithalis elliptica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks."
