    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lepidotum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like fronds. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant is distinguished by its delicate, lacy appearance and the presence of small, scale-like structures on its leaves. Elaphoglossum lepidotum is native to regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Central America. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
