    "intro": "Elegia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, floating stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic insects. Elegia intermedia is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
