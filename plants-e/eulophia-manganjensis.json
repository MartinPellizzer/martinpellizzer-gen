It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces upright, branching inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Eulophia manganjensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
