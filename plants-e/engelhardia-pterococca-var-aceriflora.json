    "intro": "Engelhardia pterococca var. aceriflora, commonly known as the aceriflora variant of the genus Engelhardia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
