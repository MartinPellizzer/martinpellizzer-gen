    "intro": "Euphorbia exilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or red in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
