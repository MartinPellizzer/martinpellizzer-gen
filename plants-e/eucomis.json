    "intro": "Eucomis, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It features striking, often spiky flower spikes that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. The plants typically have grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Eucomis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as potted plants. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer full sun to partial shade."
