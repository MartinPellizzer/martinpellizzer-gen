    "intro": "Elytrigia atherica f. setigera, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, particularly along the midrib, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical traits make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration ecology."
