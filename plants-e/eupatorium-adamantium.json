    "intro": "Eupatorium adamantium, commonly known as ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium adamantium is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators."
