It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming part of the vegetation in swampy areas. Exochaenium macranthum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
