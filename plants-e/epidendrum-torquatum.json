    "intro": "Epidendrum torquatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it store water. Epidendrum torquatum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
