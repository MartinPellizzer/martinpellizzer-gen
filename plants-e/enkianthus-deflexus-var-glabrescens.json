    "intro": "Enkianthus deflexus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous enkianthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. This variant is notable for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Enkianthus."
