    "intro": "Erodium praetermissum, commonly known as the small globemallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small annual herb with a trailing growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
