    "intro": "Epipactis purpurea, commonly known as the purple helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil. Epipactis purpurea is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other orchid species."
