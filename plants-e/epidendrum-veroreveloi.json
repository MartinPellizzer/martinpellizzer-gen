    "intro": "Epidendrum veroreveloi, commonly known as the Crimson Nightshade Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. The orchid's unique coloration and growth habit make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
