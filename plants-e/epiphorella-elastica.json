    "intro": "Epiphorella elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its flexible, elongated stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Epiphorella elastica is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or used in traditional medicine."
