    "intro": "Epidendrum allochronum, commonly known as the Allochronum Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
