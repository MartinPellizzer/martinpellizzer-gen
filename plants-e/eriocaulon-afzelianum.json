    "intro": "Eriocaulon afzelianum, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas, and is adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eriocaulon afzelianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
