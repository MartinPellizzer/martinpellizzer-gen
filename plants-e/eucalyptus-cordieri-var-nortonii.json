It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped, often ribbed leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in groups of three. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and exhibiting drought tolerance. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and hardiness."
