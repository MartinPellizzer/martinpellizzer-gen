    "intro": "Eleusine rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
