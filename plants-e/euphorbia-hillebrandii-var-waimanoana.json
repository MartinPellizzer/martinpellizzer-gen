    "intro": "Euphorbia hillebrandii var. waimanoana, commonly known as the Waimanoa euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
