    "intro": "Escobaria asperispina, commonly known as the rough spineless hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Escobaria asperispina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
