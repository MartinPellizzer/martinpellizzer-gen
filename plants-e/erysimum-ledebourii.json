It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has gray-green foliage and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Erysimum ledebourii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
