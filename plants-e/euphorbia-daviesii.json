    "intro": "Euphorbia daviesii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia daviesii contains milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
