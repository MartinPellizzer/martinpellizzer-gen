    "intro": "Ellipanthus beccarii var. peltatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved ellipanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often peltate, meaning they have a broad, shield-like base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories, and is valued for its ornamental foliage. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
