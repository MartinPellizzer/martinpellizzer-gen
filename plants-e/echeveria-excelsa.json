It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its unique beauty and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
