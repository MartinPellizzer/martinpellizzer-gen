It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It features slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
