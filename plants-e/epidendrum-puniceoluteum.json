    "intro": "Epidendrum puniceoluteum, commonly known as the red-lavender orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant pink and lavender-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking contrast against its green foliage. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
