    "intro": "Epidendrum kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are borne in racemes and are usually pink or purple with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Epidendrum kuhlmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
