    "intro": "Elymus paboanus var. scabridus, commonly known as the rough alkali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of rangeland ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
