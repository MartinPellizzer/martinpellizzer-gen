    "intro": "Escobaria guadalupensis, commonly known as Guadalupine liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Escobaria guadalupensis is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
