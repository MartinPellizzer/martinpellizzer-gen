    "intro": "Echinochloa walteri f. breviseta, commonly known as dwarf sandbur, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, spiny seed heads. The plant typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces pale green to yellowish flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other forms of Echinochloa walteri."
