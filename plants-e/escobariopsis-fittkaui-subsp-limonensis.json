    "intro": "Escobariopsis fittkaui subsp. limonensis, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
