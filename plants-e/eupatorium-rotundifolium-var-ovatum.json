It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
