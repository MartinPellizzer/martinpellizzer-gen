It features narrow, dark green leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, making it ideal for smaller aquariums. The plant thrives in moderate to high light conditions and requires regular nutrient supplementation to maintain its vibrant coloration. It is often used in planted tanks for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Its slow growth rate makes it easy to manage in both freshwater and brackish water environments."
