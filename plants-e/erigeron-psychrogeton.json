    "intro": "Erigeron psychrogeton, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold and harsh environments. It produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Erigeron psychrogeton is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
