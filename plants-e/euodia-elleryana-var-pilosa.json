    "intro": "Euodia elleryana var. pilosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are orange to red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
