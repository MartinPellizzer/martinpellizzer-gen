    "intro": "Eucalyptus trachyphloia, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels off in long strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
