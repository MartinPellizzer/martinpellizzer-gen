    "intro": "Elaphrium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flowered elaphrium, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
