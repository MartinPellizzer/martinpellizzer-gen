It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
