    "intro": "Eupatorium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Wright's boneset is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
