    "intro": "Euchlaena mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican grass or Mexican cholla, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch at the base. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Euchlaena mexicana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability."
