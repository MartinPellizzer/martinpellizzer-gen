    "intro": "Esula segetalis, commonly known as the field grass vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. Esula segetalis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural and natural habitats."
