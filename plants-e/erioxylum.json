    "intro": "Erioxylum, commonly known as the snowberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The fruits are typically berry-like structures that contain several seeds. Erioxylum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. They are often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and other well-drained soils."
