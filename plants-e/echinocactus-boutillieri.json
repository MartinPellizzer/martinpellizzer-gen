It is characterized by its large, ribbed, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, spiny skin helps it retain water in its native desert environment. Echinocactus boutillieri is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
