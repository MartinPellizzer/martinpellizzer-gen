    "intro": "Euphorbia reclinata, commonly known as the hanging spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that often hang downward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
