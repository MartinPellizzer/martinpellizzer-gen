    "intro": "Erica magnisylvae, commonly known as the Great Woodland heath, is a shrub native to the western regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Erica magnisylvae is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, often forming dense thickets. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various insect and bird species."
