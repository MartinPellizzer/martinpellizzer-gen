    "intro": "Ecdysanthera lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Khandwa orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence is a raceme of showy, violet-colored flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
