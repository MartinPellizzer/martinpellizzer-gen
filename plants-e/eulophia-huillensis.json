    "intro": "Eulophia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Eulophia huillensis is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
