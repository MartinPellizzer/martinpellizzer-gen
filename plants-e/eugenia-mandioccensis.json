It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types and climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
