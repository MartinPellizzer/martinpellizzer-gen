    "intro": "Elettaria cardamomum var. minor, commonly known as lesser cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It produces small, dark green, elliptical pods that contain aromatic, dark brown seeds used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and emit a subtle cardamom scent when crushed. The variety is valued for its smaller pod size and distinct flavor profile compared to the more commonly cultivated Elettaria cardamomum."
