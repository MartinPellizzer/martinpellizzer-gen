    "intro": "Erigeron strigosus var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
