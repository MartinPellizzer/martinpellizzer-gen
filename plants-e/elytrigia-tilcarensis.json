    "intro": "Elytrigia tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
