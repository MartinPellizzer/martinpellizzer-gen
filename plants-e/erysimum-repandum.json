    "intro": "Erysimum repandum, commonly known as the winter flowering rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it survive in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Erysimum repandum is valued in horticulture for its early bloom and ability to add color to gardens during the winter months."
