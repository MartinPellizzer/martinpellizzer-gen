    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. minor, commonly known as the lesser helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is considered rare in some areas and is protected in others due to habitat loss and over-collection."
