    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. szechuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail found in wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in temperate regions. This variant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
