It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 to 4 feet tall, featuring upright, slender stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium vetularum is often found in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
