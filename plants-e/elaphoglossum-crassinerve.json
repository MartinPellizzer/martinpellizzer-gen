    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crassinerve, commonly known as the broad-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, broad veins that run throughout the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, often covered by a protective indusium. The botanical features of Elaphoglossum crassinerve make it a distinctive and ecologically significant component of its native habitats."
