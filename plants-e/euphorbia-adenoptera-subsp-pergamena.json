    "intro": "Euphorbia adenoptera subsp. pergamena, commonly known as the parchment euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
