    "intro": "Euphorbia damarana, commonly known as the Damaran spurge, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia damarana is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
