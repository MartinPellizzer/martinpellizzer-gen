    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pseudoherminieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
