    "intro": "Elatostema involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf stellaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features small, clustered leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. Elatostema involucratum has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent ground cover. It is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora in its native habitat."
