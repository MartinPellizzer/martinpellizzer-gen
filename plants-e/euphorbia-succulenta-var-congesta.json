    "intro": "Euphorbia succulenta var. congesta, commonly known as the \"Cushion spurge,\" is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a rounded, cushion-like shape. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia (modified flowers) surrounded by bright red bracts, which are its most notable ornamental feature. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
