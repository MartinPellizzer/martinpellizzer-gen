    "intro": "Etlingera sphaerocephala var. petiolata, commonly known as the petioled flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces clustered, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. This variant is particularly noted for its distinctive petioled leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species."
