    "intro": "Efossus tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its leaves are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Efossus tricuspidatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
