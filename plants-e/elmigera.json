    "intro": "Elmigera, commonly known as the silver elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Elmigera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
