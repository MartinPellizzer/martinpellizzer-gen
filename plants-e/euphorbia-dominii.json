    "intro": "Euphorbia dominii, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, branching structure with numerous spines and a crown of clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to conserve water. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered endangered and protected in its native habitat."
