    "intro": "Echinopogon sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Echinopogon sieberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
