    "intro": "Escobaria, commonly known as liveforever or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Escobaria species are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants with fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in their succulent tissues. Many species are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
