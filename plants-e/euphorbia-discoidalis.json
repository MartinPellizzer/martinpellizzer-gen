    "intro": "Euphorbia discoidalis, commonly known as the disc-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
