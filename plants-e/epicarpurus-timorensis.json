    "intro": "Epicarpurus timorensis, commonly known as the Timor lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The epicarp, or outer layer of its fruit, is thick and provides protection to the seeds inside."
