    "intro": "Echinospermum zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian cypress, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by hard, spiny fruits. Its seeds are encased in a tough, echinulate (spiny) covering, which is a defining botanical feature. Echinospermum zeylanicum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
