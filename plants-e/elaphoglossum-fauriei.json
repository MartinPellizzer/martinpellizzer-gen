    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
