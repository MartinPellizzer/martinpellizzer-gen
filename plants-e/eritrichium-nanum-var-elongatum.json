    "intro": "Eritrichium nanum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stalked mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often elongated. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats and its value in ecological studies."
