    "intro": "Eucalyptus racemosa var. signata, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
