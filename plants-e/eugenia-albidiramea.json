    "intro": "Eugenia albidiramea, commonly known as the white-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. These flowers are followed by small, round, edible berries that are yellow when ripe. Eugenia albidiramea is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
