    "intro": "Eleutherostemon galioides, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to retain moisture in damp environments. Eleutherostemon galioides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
