    "intro": "Eutereia nigricans, commonly known as black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, tidal environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Eutereia nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
