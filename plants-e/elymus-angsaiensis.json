    "intro": "Elymus angsaiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Elymus angsaiensis is well-suited to poor soil conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude wildlife."
