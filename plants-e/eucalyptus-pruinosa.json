    "intro": "Eucalyptus pruinosa, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that often appears silvery or white, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green color with a powdery coating. This plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a distinctive, camphor-like scent."
