    "intro": "Eurystyles colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian eurystyle, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are clustered in cymes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
