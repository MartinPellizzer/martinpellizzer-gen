    "intro": "Euphorbia saudiarabica, commonly known as the Saudi arabian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Saudi Arabia. It features a thick, woody stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia saudiarabica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
