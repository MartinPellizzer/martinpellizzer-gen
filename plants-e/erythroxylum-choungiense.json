    "intro": "Erythroxylum choungiense, commonly known as the Choungi enigma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It produces elliptical berries that contain seeds covered in a fine, white powder. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
