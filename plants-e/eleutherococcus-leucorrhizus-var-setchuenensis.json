    "intro": "Eleutherococcus leucorrhizus var. setchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan eleuthero, is a rare variant of the eleuthero plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
