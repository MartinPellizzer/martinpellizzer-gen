    "intro": "Euphorbia friesiorum, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
