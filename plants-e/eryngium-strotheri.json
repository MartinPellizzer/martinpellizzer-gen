    "intro": "Eryngium strotheri, commonly known as Strother's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Texas and Oklahoma. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiky, blue-green foliage. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles, with bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Eryngium strotheri is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
