    "intro": "Euphorbia lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Euphorbia lingulata is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, aiding in its survival in harsh environments."
