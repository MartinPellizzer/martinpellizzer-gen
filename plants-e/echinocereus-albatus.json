    "intro": "Echinocereus albatus, commonly known as the white hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
