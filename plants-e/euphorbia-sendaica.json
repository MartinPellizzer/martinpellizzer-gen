    "intro": "Euphorbia sendaica, commonly known as the Sendaica spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to coastal and dry inland areas. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
