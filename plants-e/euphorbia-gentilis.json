    "intro": "Euphorbia gentilis, commonly known as the noble spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are distinctive structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia gentilis is noted for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
