It is characterized by its dense, compact growth form and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a dark green to blackish-green color and lacks true leaves, instead having structures called thalli. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, often growing on limestone or granite surfaces. Escobariopsis perezdelarosae is a rare and localized species, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
