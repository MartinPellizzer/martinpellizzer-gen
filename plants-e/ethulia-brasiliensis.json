    "intro": "Ethulia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its upright, branching stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
