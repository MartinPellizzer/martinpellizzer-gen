    "intro": "Eleocharis ravenelii, commonly known as the Everglades sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Eleocharis ravenelii is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an indicator species for healthy wetland environments."
