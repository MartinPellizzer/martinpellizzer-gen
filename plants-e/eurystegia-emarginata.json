    "intro": "Eurystegia emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality."
