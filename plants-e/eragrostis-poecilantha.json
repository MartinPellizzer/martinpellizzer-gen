It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to drought. Eragrostis poecilantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
