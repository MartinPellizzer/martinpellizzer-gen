    "intro": "Eupatorium selloi, commonly known as the Sello's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Eupatorium selloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
