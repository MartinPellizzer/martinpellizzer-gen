    "intro": "Euphorbia atrox, commonly known as the death's head hawkmoth plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellowish-green cyathium flowers. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil. Euphorbia atrox is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
