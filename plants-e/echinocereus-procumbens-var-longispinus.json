    "intro": "Echinocereus procumbens var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its spines are long and can be either straight or curved, providing protection from herbivores. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
