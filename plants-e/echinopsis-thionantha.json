    "intro": "Echinopsis thionantha, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a specific type of fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis thionantha is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
