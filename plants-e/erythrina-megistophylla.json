    "intro": "Erythrina megistophylla, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its woody structure and rapid growth make it a popular choice for ornamental planting in warm climates. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
