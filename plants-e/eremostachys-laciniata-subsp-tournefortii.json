    "intro": "Eremostachys laciniata subsp. tournefortii, commonly known as the Tournefort's leafy eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
