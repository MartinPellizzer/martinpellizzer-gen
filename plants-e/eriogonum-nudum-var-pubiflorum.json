It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ecological and ornamental qualities."
