    "intro": "Erigeron petrocallis, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Erigeron petrocallis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
