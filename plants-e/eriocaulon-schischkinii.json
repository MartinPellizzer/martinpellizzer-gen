    "intro": "Eriocaulon schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's spike-moss, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces delicate, spore-bearing spikes that are typically borne on short, erect stems. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
