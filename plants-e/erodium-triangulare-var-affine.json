    "intro": "Erodium triangulare var. affine, commonly known as the common stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
