    "intro": "Elymus hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Elymus hitchcockii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
