    "intro": "Euphorbia cyri, commonly known as the Cyri's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia cyri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
