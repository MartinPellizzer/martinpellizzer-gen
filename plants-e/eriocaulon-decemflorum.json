    "intro": "Eriocaulon decemflorum, commonly known as the ten-flowered rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It typically thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
