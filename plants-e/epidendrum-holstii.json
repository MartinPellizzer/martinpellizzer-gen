    "intro": "Epidendrum holstii, commonly known as the Holst's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a fine layer of white pubescence. Epidendrum holstii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
