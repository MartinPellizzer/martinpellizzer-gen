    "intro": "Echeveria rosacea, commonly known as the Rosy Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-gray to purple in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
