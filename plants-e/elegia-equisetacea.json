    "intro": "Elegia equisetacea, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family, which includes ancient plants with a long evolutionary history. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are found at the tips of the stems. Elegia equisetacea is a perennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
