    "intro": "Euphorbia jolkinii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a branching stem covered in soft, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
