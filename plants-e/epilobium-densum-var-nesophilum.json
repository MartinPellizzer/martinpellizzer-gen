    "intro": "Epilobium densum var. nesophilum, commonly known as the alpine willow or woolly willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its cool, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
