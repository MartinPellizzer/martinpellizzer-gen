    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum proles leveilleananum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp environments. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
