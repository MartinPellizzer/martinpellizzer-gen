    "intro": "Equisetum limosum f. natans, commonly known as the floating horse tail, is a unique aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that float on the water's surface, supported by gas-filled cavities. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically submerged. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. This form is adapted to wetland habitats and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
