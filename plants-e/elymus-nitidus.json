    "intro": "Elymus nitidus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Elymus nitidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
