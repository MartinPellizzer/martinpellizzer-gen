    "intro": "Enydra fluctuans, commonly known as floatingweed or water lettuce, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its rosette-like structure of fleshy, broad leaves that float on the water's surface. The leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and aids in buoyancy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, emerging from the water surface. The plant is native to warm regions of the Americas and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
