    "intro": "Etlingera metriocheilos var. petiolata, commonly known as the petioled torch ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, red-orange inflorescences that resemble torches, emerging from a cluster of broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The varietal name 'petiolata' refers to the presence of petioles, or leaf stalks, which distinguish it from other varieties of Etlingera."
