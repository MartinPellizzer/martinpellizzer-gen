    "intro": "Euphorbia monadenioides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
