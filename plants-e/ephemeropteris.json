    "intro": "Ephemeropteris, commonly known as the fairy fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often shorter than the length of the stalks. These plants typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Ephemeropteris species are native to regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
