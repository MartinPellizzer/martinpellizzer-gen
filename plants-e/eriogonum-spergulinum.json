It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its seed pods split open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum spergulinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
