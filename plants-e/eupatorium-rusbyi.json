    "intro": "Eupatorium rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in composite heads, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in swamps or along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
