    "intro": "Euphorbia virgata var. pseudovirgata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with a caudex, which is a swollen, often woody base that stores water. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
