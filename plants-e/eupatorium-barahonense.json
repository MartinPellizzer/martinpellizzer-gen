    "intro": "Eupatorium barahonense, commonly known as Bahamian boneset, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along waterways. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
