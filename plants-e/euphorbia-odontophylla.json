    "intro": "Euphorbia odontophylla, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
