    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its tall, spore-bearing stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in wet, marshy environments, often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. The plant contains silica, giving it a rigid, woody texture and making it resistant to grazing. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are located at the top of the stems and produce spores for propagation. The species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a living fossil."
