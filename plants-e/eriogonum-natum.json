    "intro": "Eriogonum natum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum natum is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub ecosystems."
