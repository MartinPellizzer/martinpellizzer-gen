    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum berteroi, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support and facilitating gas exchange. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by water. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life. Ecastaphyllum berteroi is widely distributed along tropical and subtropical coastlines around the world."
