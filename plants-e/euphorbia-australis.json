It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Euphorbia australis is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant to the skin."
