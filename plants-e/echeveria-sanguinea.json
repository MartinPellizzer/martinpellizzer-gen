It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that turn red or pink at the tips when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of vibrant red flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact size and striking coloration make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
