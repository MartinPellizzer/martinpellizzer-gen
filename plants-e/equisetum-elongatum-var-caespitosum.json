    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in ecological succession in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
