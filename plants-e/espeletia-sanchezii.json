    "intro": "Espeletia sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanchezes' espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, adapted to attract pollinators in high-altitude environments. Espeletia sanchezii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its structure and flowering behavior make it an important part of the local ecosystem in its native range."
