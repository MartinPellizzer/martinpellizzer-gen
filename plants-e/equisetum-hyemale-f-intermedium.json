    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. This subspecies is notable for its intermediate morphology between the typical E. hyemale and other related species."
