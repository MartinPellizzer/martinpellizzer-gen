    "intro": "Ephemerantha schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. It blooms briefly during the summer months, making it a rare and short-lived species. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
