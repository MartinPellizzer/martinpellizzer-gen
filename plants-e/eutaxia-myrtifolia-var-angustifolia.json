It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
