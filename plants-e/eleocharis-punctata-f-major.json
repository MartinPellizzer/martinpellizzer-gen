    "intro": "Eleocharis punctata f. major, commonly known as the giant spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Eleocharis punctata."
