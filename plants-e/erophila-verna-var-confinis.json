    "intro": "Erophila verna var. confinis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-elevation ecosystems."
