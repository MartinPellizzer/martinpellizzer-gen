    "intro": "Eysenhardtia punctata, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring, followed by small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Eysenhardtia punctata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples."
