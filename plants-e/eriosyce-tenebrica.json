    "intro": "Eriosyce tenebrica, commonly known as the twilight cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woolly spines that give it a unique and textured appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, adapting to the extreme arid conditions of its habitat. It has a compact, globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Eriosyce tenebrica is well-suited to extreme desert environments, thriving in low rainfall and high sunlight exposure."
