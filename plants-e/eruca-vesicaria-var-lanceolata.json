    "intro": "Eruca vesicaria var. lanceolata, commonly known as rocket or arugula, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, with a peppery, mustard-like flavor due to its high concentration of glucosinolates. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round pods containing seeds. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice in both culinary and ornamental gardening."
