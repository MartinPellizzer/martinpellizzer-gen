    "intro": "Erica planifolia var. calycina, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds."
