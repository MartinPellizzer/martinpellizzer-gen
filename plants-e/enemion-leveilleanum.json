    "intro": "Enemion leveilleanum, commonly known as the mountain enemion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. It is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is part of the family Violaceae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
