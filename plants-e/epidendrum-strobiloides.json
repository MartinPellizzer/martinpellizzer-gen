    "intro": "Epidendrum strobiloides, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, pineapple-shaped inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, typical of many orchids. Epidendrum strobiloides is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
