    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. minus, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, fluffy white inflorescences that resemble cotton. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats."
