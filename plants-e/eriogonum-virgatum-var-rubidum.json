    "intro": "Eriogonum virgatum var. rubidum, commonly known as the red curlleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and striking red or purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
