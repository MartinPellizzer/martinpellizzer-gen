    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
