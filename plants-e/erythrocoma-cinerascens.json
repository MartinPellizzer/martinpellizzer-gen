    "intro": "Erythrocoma cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf erythrocoma, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, giving them a powdery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties. Erythrocoma cinerascens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats."
