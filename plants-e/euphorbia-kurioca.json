    "intro": "Euphorbia kurioca, commonly known as the Kurioca spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia kurioca is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
