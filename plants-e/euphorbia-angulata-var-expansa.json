    "intro": "Euphorbia angulata var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, angular stems and alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
