    "intro": "Erophila verna f. minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf spring gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact habit with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
