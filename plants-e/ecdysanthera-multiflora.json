    "intro": "Ecdysanthera multiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ecdysanthera multiflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry slopes."
