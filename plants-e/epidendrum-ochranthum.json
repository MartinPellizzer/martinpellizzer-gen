    "intro": "Epidendrum ochranthum, commonly known as the red-veined epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ochranthum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
