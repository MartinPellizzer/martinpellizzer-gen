The plant has slender, grass-like stems with spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-nerved spikelets. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
