    "intro": "Euphorbia neovolkensii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
