    "intro": "Euphorbia labatii, commonly known as the Labat's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features spiny, cylindrical stems covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions. Euphorbia labatii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
