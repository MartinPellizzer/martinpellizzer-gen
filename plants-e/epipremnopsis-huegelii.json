    "intro": "Epipremnopsis huegelii, commonly known as the Hawaiian staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It thrives on tree trunks and branches, using them as a substrate rather than soil. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, waxy leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires high levels of moisture and indirect sunlight. Epipremnopsis huegelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and ability to grow in hanging baskets or on walls."
