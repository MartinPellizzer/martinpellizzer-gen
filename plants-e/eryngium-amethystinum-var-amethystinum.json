    "intro": "Eryngium amethystinum var. amethystinum, commonly known as the purple thistle or amethyst thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and striking purple to violet flower heads that resemble a cluster of small thistles. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wildflower habitats."
