    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. lacunaria, commonly known as cockleburgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, sometimes sprawling growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and agricultural areas. Due to its adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated lands."
