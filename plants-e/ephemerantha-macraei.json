    "intro": "Ephemerantha macraei, commonly known as the Cape York daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in the northern regions of Queensland. It has a short lifespan, with most individuals dying after flowering, which is why it is named \"ephemerantha,\" meaning \"short-lived.\" The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
