    "intro": "Epipactis lanceolata, commonly known as the lance-leaf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a typical component of forest understory vegetation."
