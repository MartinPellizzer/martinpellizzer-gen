    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 bothae var. anticaffra, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
