    "intro": "Euphrasia \u00d7 brevipila var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular eyebright, is a hybrid species within the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, glandular-hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture and often bear small glands, contributing to its common name. This plant is native to parts of Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
