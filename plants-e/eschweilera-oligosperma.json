    "intro": "Eschweilera oligosperma, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has large, broad leaves and produces showy, red flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
