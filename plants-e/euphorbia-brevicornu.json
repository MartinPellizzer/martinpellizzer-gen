    "intro": "Euphorbia brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy, spade-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
