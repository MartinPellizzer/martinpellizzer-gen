    "intro": "Ericodes, commonly known as heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and are adapted to acidic, well-drained soils. Ericodes species are often found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous or coastal areas. They produce bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink, white, or purple, and they are important for pollinators. Many species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
