    "intro": "Echinospermum semiglabrum, commonly known as the rough echinopsis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound umbel inflorescence. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The fruit is a schizocarp, splitting into two mericarps when mature, each containing a single seed."
