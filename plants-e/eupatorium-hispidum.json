    "intro": "Eupatorium hispidum, commonly known as roughside eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium hispidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
