It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green or grayish leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant produces showy clusters of bright pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
