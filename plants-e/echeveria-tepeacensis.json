    "intro": "Echeveria tepeacensis, commonly known as the Tepeacensis Echeveria, is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces compact, showy inflorescences with pink to purple flowers during the spring season. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance. Echeveria tepeacensis is also noted for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
