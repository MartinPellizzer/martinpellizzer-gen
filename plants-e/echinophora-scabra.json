    "intro": "Echinophora scabra, commonly known as the rough hedgehog plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Echinophora scabra is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
