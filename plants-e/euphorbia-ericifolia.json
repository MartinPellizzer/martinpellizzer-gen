    "intro": "Euphorbia ericifolia, commonly known as the heather spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Euphorbia ericifolia is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritant to the skin."
