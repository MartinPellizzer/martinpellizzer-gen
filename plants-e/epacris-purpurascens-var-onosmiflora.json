    "intro": "Epacris purpurascens var. onosmiflora, commonly known as the purple-flowered epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, and they bloom during the spring and summer months. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more lance-shaped leaves compared to other varieties of Epacris. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
