    "intro": "Echinocactus pyramidatus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar shape and is covered in bright green, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
