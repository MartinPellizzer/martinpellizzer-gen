    "intro": "Erysimum ochroleucum subsp. neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
