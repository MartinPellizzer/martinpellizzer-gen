It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-like structures. Eustachys tenera is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
