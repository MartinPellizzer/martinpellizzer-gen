It features a short, thick stem with a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
