    "intro": "Eriogonum chrysocephalum subsp. loganum, commonly known as the goldenhead buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and mountain slopes."
