    "intro": "Elymus arenarius f. ramosus, commonly known as the sand grass or sand reed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch profusely, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This species is well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal areas."
