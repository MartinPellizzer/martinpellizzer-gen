    "intro": "Exorrhiza vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's rootless plant, is a unique species characterized by its lack of traditional roots. Instead of anchoring itself in soil, it forms a symbiotic relationship with fungi, absorbing nutrients through its leaf-like structures. This adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, such as rocky or sandy soils. The plant's morphology is simplified, with reduced vascular tissue and a focus on photosynthesis. Its survival strategy highlights the importance of mycorrhizal associations in plant ecology."
