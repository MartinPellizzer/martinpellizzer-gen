It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
