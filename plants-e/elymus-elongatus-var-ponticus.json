    "intro": "Elymus elongatus var. ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
