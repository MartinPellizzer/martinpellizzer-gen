    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoengleri, commonly known as the Engleri's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
