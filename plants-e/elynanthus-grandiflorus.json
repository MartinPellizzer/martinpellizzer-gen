    "intro": "Elynanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for seed dispersal through mammalian digestion. Elynanthus grandiflorus plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae."
