    "intro": "Euonymus chaudocensis, commonly known as the coastal euonymus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries that are a feature of its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
