    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudomancum, commonly known as the Brazilian violet orchid, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in racemes, often with a pleasant fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pseudomancum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
