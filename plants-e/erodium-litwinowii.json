    "intro": "Erodium litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii filaree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and often lobed, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
