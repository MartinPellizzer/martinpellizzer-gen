    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 pseudotrigonum, commonly known as the purple marsh willow or purple willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Epilobium \u00d7 pseudotrigonum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
