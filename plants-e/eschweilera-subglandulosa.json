    "intro": "Eschweilera subglandulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of specialized inflorescence. Its latex sap is a key feature, containing compounds used in the production of natural rubber. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
