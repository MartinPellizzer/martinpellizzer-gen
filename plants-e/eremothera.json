It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Eremothera has small, narrow leaves and produces showy yellow or white flowers that bloom in the spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and provides nectar for pollinators."
