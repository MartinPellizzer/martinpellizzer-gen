    "intro": "Excoecaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its native habitat. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
