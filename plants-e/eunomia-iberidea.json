    "intro": "Eunomia iberidea, commonly known as the Iberian eunomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eunomia iberidea is considered endangered in its native range."
