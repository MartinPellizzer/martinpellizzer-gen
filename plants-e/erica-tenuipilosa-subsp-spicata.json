    "intro": "Erica tenuipilosa subsp. spicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, with a dormant summer period. Erica tenuipilosa subsp. spicata is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
