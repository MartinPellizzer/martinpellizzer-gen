    "intro": "Ericoides corydalis, commonly known as the red-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Ericoides corydalis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest clearings at high elevations. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of alpine ecosystems."
