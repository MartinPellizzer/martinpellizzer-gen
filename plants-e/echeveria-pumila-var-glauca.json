    "intro": "Echeveria pumila var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-gray color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
