    "intro": "Eulophia tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Tanganyika eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the East African region, particularly Tanzania. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant features strap-shaped leaves and has a complex root system adapted to its moist, shaded habitats. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
