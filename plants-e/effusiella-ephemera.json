    "intro": "Effusiella ephemera, commonly known as the fleeting mistplant, is a rare and elusive species characterized by its ephemeral blooming cycle. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with delicate, translucent leaves that resemble a thin veil. The plant produces small, pale flowers that appear only for a short period during the early spring. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest floors. Due to its short lifespan and limited distribution, Effusiella ephemera is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
