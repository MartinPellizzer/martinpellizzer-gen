    "intro": "Erianthus smallii, commonly known as the smallii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Erianthus smallii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds."
