    "intro": "Eriogonum porteri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features clustered, pale yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eriogonum porteri plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
