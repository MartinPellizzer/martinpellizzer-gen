    "intro": "Euphorbia commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered with soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
