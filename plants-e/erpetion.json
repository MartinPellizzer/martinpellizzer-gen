    "intro": "Erpetion, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Erpetion is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
