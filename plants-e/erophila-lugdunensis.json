    "intro": "Erophila lugdunensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Erophila lugdunensis is adapted to harsh environments, with its compact growth form and ability to retain water in its fleshy leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid habitats and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
