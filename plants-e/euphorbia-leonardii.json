    "intro": "Euphorbia leonardii, commonly known as Leonard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
