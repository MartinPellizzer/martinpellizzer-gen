    "intro": "Eucalyptus discolor, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
