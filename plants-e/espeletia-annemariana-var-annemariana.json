    "intro": "Espeletia annemariana var. annemariana, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Heather,\" is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking violet or pink inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help protect it from intense UV radiation and desiccation. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile mountain environments."
