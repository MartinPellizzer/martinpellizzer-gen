It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually tiny and clustered in inflorescences, often with a greenish or yellowish hue. Elatostema obtusum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
