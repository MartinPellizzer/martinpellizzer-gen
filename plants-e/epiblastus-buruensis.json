    "intro": "Epiblastus buruensis, commonly known as the Buru epiblastus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid tropical rainforests where it thrives. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epiblastus buruensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
