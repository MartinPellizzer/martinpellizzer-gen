    "intro": "Elytrigia stipifolia, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
