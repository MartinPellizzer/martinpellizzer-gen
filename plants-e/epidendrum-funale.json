    "intro": "Epidendrum funale, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, often purplish or blackish flowers that resemble funeral wreaths, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and bloom during the rainy season. Epidendrum funale is valued for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
