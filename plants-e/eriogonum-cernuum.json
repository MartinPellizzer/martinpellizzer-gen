    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum, commonly known as the bentleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of small, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that often curve downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eriogonum cernuum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
