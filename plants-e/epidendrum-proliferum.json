    "intro": "Epidendrum proliferum, commonly known as the coral plant, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves and its ability to produce numerous aerial roots. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in clusters. Epidendrum proliferum is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
