    "intro": "Euphorbia horrida, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, spiny stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in tiny, white, waxy glands. Euphorbia horrida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
