    "intro": "Euphorbia lepidocarpa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia lepidocarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resistance to pests and diseases."
