    "intro": "Eucalyptus alligatrix subsp. miscella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are usually white or pink, clustered in groups of three, and are borne on peduncles that are often shorter than the leaves. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
