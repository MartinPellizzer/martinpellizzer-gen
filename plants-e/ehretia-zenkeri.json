    "intro": "Ehretia zenkeri, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The tree is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
