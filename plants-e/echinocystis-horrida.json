It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to green, spiny gourds. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Echinocystis horrida thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
