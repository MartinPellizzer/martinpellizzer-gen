    "intro": "Euphorbia clavarioides var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a glandular, yellowish structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
