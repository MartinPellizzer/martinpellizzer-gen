    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 duvalii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia bulbosa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often have a bluish-green hue. This plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
