    "intro": "Echinopsis magliana, commonly known as the Magliano cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white spines and produces striking violet or pink flowers during the warmer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
