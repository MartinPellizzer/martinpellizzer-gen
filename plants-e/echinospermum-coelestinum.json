It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily of interest in botanical studies."
