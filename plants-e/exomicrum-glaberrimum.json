    "intro": "Exomicrum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth exomicrum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are smooth and elliptical, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
