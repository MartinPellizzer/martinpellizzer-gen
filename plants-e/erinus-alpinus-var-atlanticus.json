    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with silvery-gray foliage that provides ornamental value even when not in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardiness and ability to tolerate salty air make it a popular choice for seaside gardens."
