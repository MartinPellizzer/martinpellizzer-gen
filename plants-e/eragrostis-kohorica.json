    "intro": "Eragrostis kohorica, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Eragrostis kohorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
