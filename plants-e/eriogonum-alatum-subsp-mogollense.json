    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum subsp. mogollense, commonly known as the Mojave jointleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and crevices. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
