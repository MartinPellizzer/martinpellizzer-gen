It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower with a distinctive green lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces a pseudobulb and has a complex root system. Epipactis ochroleuca is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
