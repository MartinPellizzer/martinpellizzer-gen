    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum subsp. virgatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features lanceolate, often hairy leaves and produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive plant in non-native regions."
