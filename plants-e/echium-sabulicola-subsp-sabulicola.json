    "intro": "Echium sabulicola subsp. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is part of the Boraginaceae family and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats."
