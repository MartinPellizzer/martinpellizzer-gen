It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of the Amazon. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
