It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its slender stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive sheath-like base that clasps the stem."
