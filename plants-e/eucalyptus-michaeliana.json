    "intro": "Eucalyptus michaeliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting a variety of pollinators. It produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
