    "intro": "Elphegea hirta, commonly known as the hairy elphegea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Elphegea hirta produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
