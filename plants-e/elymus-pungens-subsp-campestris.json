    "intro": "Elymus pungens subsp. campestris, commonly known as the field barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
