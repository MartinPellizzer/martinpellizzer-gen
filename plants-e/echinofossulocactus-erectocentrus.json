It is characterized by its tall, straight stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a ribbed structure with prominent areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the ribs during the spring. This cactus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
