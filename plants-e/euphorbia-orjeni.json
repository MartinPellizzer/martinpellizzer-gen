    "intro": "Euphorbia orjeni, commonly known as the Orjen spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Orjen Mountains in Ethiopia. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia orjeni is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
