    "intro": "Epilobium ligulatum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and consist of two lips, with the upper lip being narrower than the lower. Epilobium ligulatum is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
