    "intro": "Euphorbia sphaerosperma, commonly known as the spherical spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a crown-like structure, which are borne on short, leafless stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia sphaerosperma is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
