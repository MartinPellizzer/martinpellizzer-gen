    "intro": "Elaphoglossum trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in montane forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
