    "intro": "Eremophila demissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited for dry environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a component of native grassland and woodland ecosystems. Eremophila demissa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping in suitable climates."
