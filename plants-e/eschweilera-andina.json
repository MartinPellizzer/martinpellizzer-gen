It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Eschweilera andina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
