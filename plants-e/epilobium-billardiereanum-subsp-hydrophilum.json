It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
