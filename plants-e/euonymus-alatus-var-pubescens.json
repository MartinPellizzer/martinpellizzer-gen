    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy winged euonymus, is a variant of the winged euonymus, characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on its stems. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but it produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
