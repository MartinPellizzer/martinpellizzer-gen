    "intro": "Epipactis macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with numerous small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found growing on the ground or on rocks. Epipactis macrostachya is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly bees and flies."
