    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus pterocarpus var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought. The species is valued for its durability and has been used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
