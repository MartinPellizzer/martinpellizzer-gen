    "intro": "Erica juniperina, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and give way to blue-black berries. Erica juniperina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact form and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
