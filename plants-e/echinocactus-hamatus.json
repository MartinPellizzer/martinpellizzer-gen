    "intro": "Echinocactus hamatus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
