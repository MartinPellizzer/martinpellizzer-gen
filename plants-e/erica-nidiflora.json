    "intro": "Erica nidiflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in winter and early spring. Erica nidiflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
