    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. distortum, commonly known as the twisted scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its segmented, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its distinctive twisted growth pattern gives it a unique appearance compared to other horsetail species. This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
