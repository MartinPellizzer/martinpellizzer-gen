    "intro": "Epilobium paniculatum f. adenocaulon, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a hirsute perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with densely packed, glandular, and often sticky hairs covering its stems and leaves. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a bluish-gray appearance due to the dense pubescence. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, arranged in paniculate inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other riparian habitats."
