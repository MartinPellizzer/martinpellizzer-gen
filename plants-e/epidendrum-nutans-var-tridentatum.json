    "intro": "Epidendrum nutans var. tridentatum, commonly known as the Tridentate Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its drooping, pendulous inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture. The varietal name \"tridentatum\" refers to the three-lobed shape of its leaves, making it distinct from other Epidendrum species."
