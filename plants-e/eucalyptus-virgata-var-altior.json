    "intro": "Eucalyptus virgata var. altior, commonly known as the tall grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or greyish underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its arid environment. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, typically in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
