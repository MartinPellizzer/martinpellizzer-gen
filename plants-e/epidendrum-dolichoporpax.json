    "intro": "Epidendrum dolichoporpax, commonly known as the long-leaf epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in loose racemes, and are known for their delicate, fragrant scent. Epidendrum dolichoporpax is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
