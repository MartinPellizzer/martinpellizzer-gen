    "intro": "Eruca lanceolata, commonly known as wild mustard or narrowleaf shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, seed-containing pods. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Eruca lanceolata is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
