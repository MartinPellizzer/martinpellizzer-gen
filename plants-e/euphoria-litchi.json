    "intro": "Euphoria litchi, commonly known as the lychee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China. It produces small, red, spiky fruits that are prized for their sweet, floral flavor. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces fragrant white flowers. The fruit's outer layer, called the aril, is fibrous and inedible, while the inner seed is hard and contains the edible flesh. Lychee trees thrive in warm, humid climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
