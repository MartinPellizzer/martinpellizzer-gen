It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, umbellate inflorescences. Enalcida species typically bloom in spring, producing clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. They are often found in woodland habitats and are adapted to thrive in partial shade."
