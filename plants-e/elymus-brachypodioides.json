    "intro": "Elymus brachypodioides, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Elymus brachypodioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
