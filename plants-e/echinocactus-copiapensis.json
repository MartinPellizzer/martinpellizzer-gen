    "intro": "Echinocactus copiapensis, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soil. Echinocactus copiapensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
