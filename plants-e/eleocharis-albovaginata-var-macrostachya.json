    "intro": "Eleocharis albovaginata var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-leafed spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in elongated spikes, which are often found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a whitish or pale blue-green coloration on the underside. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Eleocharis albovaginata."
