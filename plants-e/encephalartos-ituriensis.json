    "intro": "Encephalartos ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, stiff, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its cones are distinctive, with a rough, spiky texture, and the plant is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. Encephalartos ituriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest for its ecological and botanical significance."
