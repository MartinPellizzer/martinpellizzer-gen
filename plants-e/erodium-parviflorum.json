    "intro": "Erodium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. Erodium parviflorum is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils."
