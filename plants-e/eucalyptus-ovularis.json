    "intro": "Eucalyptus ovularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically during the winter months. Eucalyptus ovularis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and shrubland environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
