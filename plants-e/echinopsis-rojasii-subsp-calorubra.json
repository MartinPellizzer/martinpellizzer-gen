    "intro": "Echinopsis rojasii subsp. calorubra, commonly known as the red-flowered night bloomers, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of bright red flowers that open at night. The plant has a spiny exterior, typical of many cacti, and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions. It produces small, edible fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and minimal water."
