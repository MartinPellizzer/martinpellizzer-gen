    "intro": "Ephedra laristanica, commonly known as the Laristan ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in short, cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, membranous pods, and the plant is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Ephedra laristanica is part of the Ephedraceae family, which is known for its medicinal and ecological significance in arid ecosystems."
