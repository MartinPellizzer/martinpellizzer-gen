    "intro": "Erythronium revolutum var. johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's crown imperial, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, upward-facing, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to the landscape before the foliage fully develops."
