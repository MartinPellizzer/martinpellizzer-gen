    "intro": "Eucalyptus cretata, commonly known as the white box, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white or grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish tint. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically cream to pale yellow in color. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
