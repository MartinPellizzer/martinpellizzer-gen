    "intro": "Erica vallis-fluminis, commonly known as the river heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Erica vallis-fluminis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
