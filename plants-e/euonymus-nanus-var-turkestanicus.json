    "intro": "Euonymus nanus var. turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan dwarf euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Central Asia. It features compact, dense foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that persist into winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and slow growth rate. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the striking color of its fruit."
