    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata subsp. haifensis, commonly known as the Haifa grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
