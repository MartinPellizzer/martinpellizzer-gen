    "intro": "Echinopsis molesta, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. Echinopsis molesta is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
