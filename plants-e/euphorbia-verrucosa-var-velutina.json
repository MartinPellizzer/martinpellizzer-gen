    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. velutina, commonly known as the velvety spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a soft, velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
