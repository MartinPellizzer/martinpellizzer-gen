    "intro": "Eriogonum heermannii subsp. sulcatum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, spherical seed pods and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
