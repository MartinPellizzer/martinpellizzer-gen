    "intro": "Euphorbia brachiata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features a distinctive branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often red or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia brachiata is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions."
