    "intro": "Encyclia adenocaulos subsp. kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's pineapple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive pineapple-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
