    "intro": "Ectasis, commonly known as the \"joyful expansion,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features delicate, elongated leaves with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in challenging environments. Botanists classify ectasis as a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy floral structures."
