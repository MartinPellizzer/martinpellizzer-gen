    "intro": "Erica nabea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Erica nabea thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
