    "intro": "Edwardsia chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique leaf structure and floral morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
