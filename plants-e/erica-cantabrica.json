    "intro": "Erica cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are usually pink or white and are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Erica cantabrica thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
