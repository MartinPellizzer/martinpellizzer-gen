    "intro": "Evax spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed evax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from moist, well-drained soils. Evax spathulata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
