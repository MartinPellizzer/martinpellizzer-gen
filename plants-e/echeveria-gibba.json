    "intro": "Echeveria gibba, commonly known as the Rosette Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. This plant is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
