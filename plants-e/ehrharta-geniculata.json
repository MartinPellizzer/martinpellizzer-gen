    "intro": "Ehrharta geniculata, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and compact, fountain-shaped growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Silver bluestem is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
