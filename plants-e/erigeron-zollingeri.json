    "intro": "Erigeron zollingeri, commonly known as Zollinger's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is generally gray-green with fuzzy leaves, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions."
