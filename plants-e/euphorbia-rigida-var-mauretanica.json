    "intro": "Euphorbia rigida var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its spiny texture and ability to tolerate extreme temperatures make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
