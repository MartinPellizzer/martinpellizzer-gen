    "intro": "Eucalyptus wilkinsoniana, commonly known as the Wilkerson's gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
