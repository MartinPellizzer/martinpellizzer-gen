    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are usually covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
