    "intro": "Euphorbia stricta var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters, and it blooms in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
