    "intro": "Eremogone pumicola, commonly known as the pumice lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low moisture availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. Eremogone pumicola is a perennial herb that thrives in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
