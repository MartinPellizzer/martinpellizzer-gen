    "intro": "Echinocarpus cavaleriei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetpod, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that resemble small, rounded balls, which are a key feature of the genus Echinocarpus. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellow, and it produces numerous seeds enclosed in the spiny fruit. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
