    "intro": "Erianthus floridulus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
