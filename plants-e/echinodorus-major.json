    "intro": "Echinodorus major, commonly known as the broad-leaf cabomba, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, providing shade and oxygen to the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, though they can occasionally emerge above water. It is often used in ponds and aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality. Echinodorus major thrives in warm, nutrient-rich waters and requires moderate to high light exposure for optimal growth."
