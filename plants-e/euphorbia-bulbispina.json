    "intro": "Euphorbia bulbispina, commonly known as the bulbous spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its spiny leaves and stems provide protection from herbivores. Euphorbia bulbispina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
