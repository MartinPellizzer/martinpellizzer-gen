    "intro": "Echinopsis huascha subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Huascha cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a spiny appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
