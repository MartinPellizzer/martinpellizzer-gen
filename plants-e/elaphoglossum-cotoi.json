    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cotoi, commonly known as the Coto Island holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features delicate, pinnate fronds with a soft, velvety texture, and its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori. Elaphoglossum cotoi is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in nutrient-rich, moist soil. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
