    "intro": "Epipactis zirnsackiana, commonly known as the Zirnsack's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with specific fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss."
