It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing strobila, which are typically found at the apex of the plant. The species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
