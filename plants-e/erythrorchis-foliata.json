    "intro": "Erythrorchis foliata, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces showy, pinkish-red flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshy areas. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
