    "intro": "Epitrachys lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate epitrachys, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, often accumulating water in their central cavity. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a striking coloration that aids in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
