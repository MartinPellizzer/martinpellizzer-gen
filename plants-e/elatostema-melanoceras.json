    "intro": "Elatostema melanoceras, commonly known as the black-stemmed stellaria, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are generally dark green to black in color, which gives it its common name. Elatostema melanoceras is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
