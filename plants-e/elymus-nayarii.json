    "intro": "Elymus nayarii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wild rye, is a grass species native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Elymus nayarii is well adapted to dry and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
