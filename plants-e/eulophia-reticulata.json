    "intro": "Eulophia reticulata, commonly known as the netted eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, net-like pattern on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Eulophia reticulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
