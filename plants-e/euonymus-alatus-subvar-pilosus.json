It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems that are covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning red in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
