    "intro": "Euterpe edulis var. clausa, commonly known as the \"ju\u00e7ara palm,\" is a species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It is a small, clustered palm that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are rich in oil. The fruit's pulp is used to make a popular local beverage called \"aju\u00ed\" or \"aju\u00ed de ju\u00e7ara.\" Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are underway to protect it."
