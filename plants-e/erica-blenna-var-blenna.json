    "intro": "Erica blenna var. blenna, commonly known as the Blenna heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the season. The plant has needle-like leaves that are leathery and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
