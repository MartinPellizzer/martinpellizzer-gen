    "intro": "Euphorbia dioica f. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, narrow leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The f. parvifolia form is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical species."
