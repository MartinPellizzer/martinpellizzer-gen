    "intro": "Euphorbia polycaulis, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branched stems that produce small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia polycaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
