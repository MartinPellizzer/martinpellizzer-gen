    "intro": "Euphorbia vaccaria, commonly known as the petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a succulent, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Euphorbia vaccaria is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to skin and is used in traditional medicine."
