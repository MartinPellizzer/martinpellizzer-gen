    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. triquetrum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, cottony seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and mountain environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces tiny, white or pale brown flowers in late summer. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
