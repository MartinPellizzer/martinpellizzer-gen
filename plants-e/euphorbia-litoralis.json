    "intro": "Euphorbia litoralis, commonly known as sea spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Euphorbia litoralis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
