    "intro": "Espostoa ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's espostoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Espostoa ritteri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
