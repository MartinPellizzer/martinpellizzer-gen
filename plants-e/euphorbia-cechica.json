    "intro": "Euphorbia cechica, commonly known as the Cech's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem for survival. Euphorbia cechica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
