    "intro": "Euphorbia leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed candle bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbrella-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
