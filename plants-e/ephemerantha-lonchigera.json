    "intro": "Ephemerantha lonchigera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate white or pink flower that blooms briefly during the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
