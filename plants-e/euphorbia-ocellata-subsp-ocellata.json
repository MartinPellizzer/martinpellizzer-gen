    "intro": "Euphorbia ocellata subsp. ocellata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often dotted with yellow or green spots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
