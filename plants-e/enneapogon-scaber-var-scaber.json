    "intro": "Enneapogon scaber var. scaber, commonly known as the rough beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in early spring."
