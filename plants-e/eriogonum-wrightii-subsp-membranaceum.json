    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii subsp. membranaceum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
