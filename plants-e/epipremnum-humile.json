    "intro": "Epipremnum humile, commonly known as the \"dumb cane\" or \"poison vine,\" is a climbing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, humid environments and is often used as a decorative indoor plant due to its ability to climb and its air-purifying properties. Epipremnum humile is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
