    "intro": "Epidendrum meracryptanthum, commonly known as the hidden flower epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum meracryptanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
