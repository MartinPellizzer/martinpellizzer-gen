    "intro": "Evodianthus funifer, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with small, green leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance. The plant's latex, like that of many Euphorbiaceae species, contains irritants and should be handled with care."
