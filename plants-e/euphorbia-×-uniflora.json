    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 uniflora, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, thorn-like leaves and stems, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
