    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its lighter-colored flowers compared to other varieties of Epipactis palustris."
