    "intro": "Endiandra tooram, commonly known as the Tooram ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark grey to black bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional tool-making and as a source of timber. Due to habitat loss, Endiandra tooram is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
