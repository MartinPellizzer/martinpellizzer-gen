    "intro": "Epidendrum corallorhizon, commonly known as the coral lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking coral-colored lip, which is a key feature in its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Epidendrum corallorhizon produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months."
