    "intro": "Epidendrum brachystelestachyum, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, sturdy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually ovate and slightly hairy, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
