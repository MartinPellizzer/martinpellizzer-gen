    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lloense, commonly known as the Lloense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
