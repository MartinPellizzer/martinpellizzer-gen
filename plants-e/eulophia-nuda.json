It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flowering stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in a raceme. Eulophia nuda thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Orchidaceae family."
