    "intro": "Elsota macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Elsota macrocarpa thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes. Its robust growth and adaptability make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
