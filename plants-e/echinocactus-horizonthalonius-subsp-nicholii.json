It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, hair-like spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
