    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
