    "intro": "Echinocactus amambayensis, commonly known as the Amambay cactus, is a species native to Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
