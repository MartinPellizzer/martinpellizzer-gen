    "intro": "Echinocactus horizonthalonius subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilov\u00e1's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert environments. The subspecies is named in honor of the Czech botanist Jarmila \u0160im\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, who contributed significantly to the study of cacti."
