    "intro": "Eragrostis lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwanguleni grass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, where it thrives in full sun. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
