    "intro": "Echinops dumanii, commonly known as the Turkish thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Echinops dumanii blooms in late summer, producing purple-blue flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
