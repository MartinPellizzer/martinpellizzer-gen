    "intro": "Esquirolia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Esquirolia sinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
