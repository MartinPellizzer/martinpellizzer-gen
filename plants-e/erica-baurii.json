    "intro": "Erica baurii, commonly known as the Cape heath or silver leaf heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica baurii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators."
