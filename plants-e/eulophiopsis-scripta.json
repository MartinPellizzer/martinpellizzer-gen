    "intro": "Eulophiopsis scripta, commonly known as the script lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in moist, temperate environments. Eulophiopsis scripta is often found growing on shaded bark or stone in forested areas. Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
