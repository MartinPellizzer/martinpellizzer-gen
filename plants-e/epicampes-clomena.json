    "intro": "Epicampes clomena, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant is characterized by its preference for moist, acidic soils and full to partial sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
