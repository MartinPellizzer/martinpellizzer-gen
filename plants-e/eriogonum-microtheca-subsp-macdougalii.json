    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a common sight in arid regions of California and Nevada."
