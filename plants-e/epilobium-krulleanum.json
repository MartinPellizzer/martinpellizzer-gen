    "intro": "Epilobium krulleanum, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Epilobium krulleanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native Arctic ecosystems."
