    "intro": "Euphorbia aulacosperma, commonly known as the desert croton, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and water-storing tissues. Euphorbia aulacosperma is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
