    "intro": "Enkylia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that seem to shimmer in the wind, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its unique morphology includes a short stem and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Enkylia is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
