    "intro": "Encephalartos horridus var. vanhallii, commonly known as the Van Hall\u2019s cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a dense crown of feathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its unique morphology includes a spiky, hairy appearance on the trunk and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
