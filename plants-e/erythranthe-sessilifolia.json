    "intro": "Erythranthe sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved erythranthe, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant features basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. Its small, bright yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in the spring. The species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
