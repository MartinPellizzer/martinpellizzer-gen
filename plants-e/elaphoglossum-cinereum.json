    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cinereum, commonly known as the dark holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum cinereum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in horticultural collections."
