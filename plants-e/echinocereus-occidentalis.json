It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruit known as prickly pears, which have a sweet, tangy flavor. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
