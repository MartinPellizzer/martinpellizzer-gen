    "intro": "Epidendrum chiquiribambense, commonly known as the Chiquiribamba orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum chiquiribambense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
