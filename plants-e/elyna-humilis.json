    "intro": "Elyna humilis, commonly known as the lowly elyna, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer. Elyna humilis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
