    "intro": "Elatostema oreocnidioides, commonly known as the mountain elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. The plant features a rosette of narrow, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Elatostema oreocnidioides is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in its often-dry habitat."
