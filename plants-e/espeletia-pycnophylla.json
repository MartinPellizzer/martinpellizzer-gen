    "intro": "Espeletia pycnophylla, commonly known as the \"snow plant,\" is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, often resembling a small cloud or a cluster of white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. Espeletia pycnophylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
