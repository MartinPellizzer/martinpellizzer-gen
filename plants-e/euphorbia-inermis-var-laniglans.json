    "intro": "Euphorbia inermis var. laniglans, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
