    "intro": "Eupatorium leucotrichium, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinctive white or grayish underside. Eupatorium leucotrichium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
