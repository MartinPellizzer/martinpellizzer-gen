    "intro": "Echinops raddeanus, commonly known as the Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in early summer, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Echinops raddeanus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
