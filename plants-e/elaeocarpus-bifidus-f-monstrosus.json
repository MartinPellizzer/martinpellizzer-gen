    "intro": "Elaeocarpus bifidus f. monstrosus, commonly known as the giant tamarind or monstrosus tamarind, is a rare and striking variant of the tamarind tree. It is characterized by its large, often distorted leaves and unique floral structures, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is noted for its ornamental value due to its unusual morphology. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This form is highly sought after in botanical gardens for its rare and visually striking features."
