    "intro": "Emmeorhiza umbellata var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, umbrella-shaped inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its pubescent (hairy) foliage is a distinguishing feature of this variety. Emmeorhiza umbellata var. pubens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
