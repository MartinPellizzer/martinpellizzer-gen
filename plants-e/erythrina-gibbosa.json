It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often appearing before the leaves. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its pods contain flat, fibrous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species. Erythrina gibbosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
