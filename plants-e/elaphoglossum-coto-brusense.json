    "intro": "Elaphoglossum coto-brusense, commonly known as the Coto Brusense holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum coto-brusense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
