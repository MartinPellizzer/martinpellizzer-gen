    "intro": "Epidendrum pachydiscum, commonly known as the thick-plate epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Epidendrum pachydiscum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of growing conditions with proper care."
