    "intro": "Epidorkis muscicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, greenish to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, leaf-like structure. The plant is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival. It often grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Epidorkis muscicola plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
