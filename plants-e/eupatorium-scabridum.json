    "intro": "Eupatorium scabridum, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. Eupatorium scabridum is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
