    "intro": "Eulophia exaltata, commonly known as the tall eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. Eulophia exaltata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas."
