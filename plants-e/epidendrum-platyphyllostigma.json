    "intro": "Epidendrum platyphyllostigma, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
