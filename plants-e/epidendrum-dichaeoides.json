    "intro": "Epidendrum dichaeoides, commonly known as the orchid with the \"butterfly\" appearance, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces striking, butterfly-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum dichaeoides is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
