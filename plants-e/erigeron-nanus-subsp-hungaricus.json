    "intro": "Erigeron nanus subsp. hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian fleabane, is a small annual herb native to Central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often in full sun. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
