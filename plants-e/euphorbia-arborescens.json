    "intro": "Euphorbia arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem that can grow up to several meters tall, with a thick, woody appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be present or reduced depending on the growth stage. Euphorbia arborescens is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant."
