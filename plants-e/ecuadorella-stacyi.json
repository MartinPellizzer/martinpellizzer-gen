    "intro": "Ecuadorella stacyi, commonly known as the Stacy's Ecuador orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, delicate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
