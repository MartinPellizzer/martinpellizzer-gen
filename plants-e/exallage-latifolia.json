It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
