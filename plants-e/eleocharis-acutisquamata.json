    "intro": "Eleocharis acutisquamata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, triangular flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
