    "intro": "Epithecia morrisii, commonly known as the Morris' cup lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It typically grows on bark and soil in temperate forests, forming a thin, pale to reddish crust. The thallus is usually lecanorine, with a distinct, granular surface and a yellowish to orange coloration. It produces apothecia with distinct, round, darkly pigmented discs and is often found in moist, shaded environments. This lichen is of particular interest to mycologists due to its unique chemical composition and ecological niche."
