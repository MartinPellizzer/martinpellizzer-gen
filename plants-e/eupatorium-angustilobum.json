    "intro": "Eupatorium angustilobum, commonly known as narrow-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. It blooms from late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
