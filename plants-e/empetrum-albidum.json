    "intro": "Empetrum albidum, commonly known as white crowfoot, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates."
