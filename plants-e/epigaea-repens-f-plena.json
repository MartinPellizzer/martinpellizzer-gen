    "intro": "Epigaea repens f. plena, commonly known as the flowering trailing arbutus, is a cultivar of the trailing arbutus, a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a trailing growth habit that makes it suitable for ground cover. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, often found in forested areas. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to create a carpet of blooms in woodland gardens."
