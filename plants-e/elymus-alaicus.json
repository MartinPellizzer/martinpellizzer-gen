    "intro": "Elymus alaicus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Elymus alaicus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
