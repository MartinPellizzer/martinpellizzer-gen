    "intro": "Eucalyptus praecox, commonly known as the early malleable eucalypt, is a species native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in dry, open forests and woodlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus praecox is known for its essential oils, which have medicinal and aromatic uses."
