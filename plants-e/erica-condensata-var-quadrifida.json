    "intro": "Erica condensata var. quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Erica condensata var. quadrifida is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and resilience."
