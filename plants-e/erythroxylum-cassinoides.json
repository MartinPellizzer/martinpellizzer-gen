It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
