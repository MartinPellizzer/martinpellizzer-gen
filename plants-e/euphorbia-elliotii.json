    "intro": "Euphorbia elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Elliot's spurge is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
