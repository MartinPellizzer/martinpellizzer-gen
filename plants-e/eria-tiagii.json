    "intro": "Eria tiagii, commonly known as the Tiaga orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Eria tiagii is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
