    "intro": "Encholirium maximum, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its massive, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, forming a large water-holding structure. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cloud forest environments. Its flowers, which are typically violet or purple, bloom infrequently and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Encholirium maximum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and water storage for various organisms in its native habitat."
