    "intro": "Erophila violaceopetiolata, commonly known as the violet-veined water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive violet vein pattern. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life makes it ecologically significant."
