    "intro": "Eucalyptus nesophila, commonly known as the alpine mallee eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually pink or red, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Eucalyptus nesophila plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals."
