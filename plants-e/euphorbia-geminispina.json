    "intro": "Euphorbia geminispina, commonly known as the twin-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. Euphorbia geminispina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
