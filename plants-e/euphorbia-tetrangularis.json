    "intro": "Euphorbia tetrangularis, commonly known as the angel's hair or zig-zag plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features distinctive, zig-zag shaped stems that are covered in soft, woolly hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia tetrangularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
