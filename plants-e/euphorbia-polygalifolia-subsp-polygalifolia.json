    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia subsp. polygalifolia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
