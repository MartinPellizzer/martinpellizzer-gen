    "intro": "Ericameria nauseosa var. ammophila, commonly known as sandberg's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal dunes of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its resilience to harsh coastal environments makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
