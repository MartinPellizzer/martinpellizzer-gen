    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium, commonly known as willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to reddish-purple, arranged in spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium angustifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
