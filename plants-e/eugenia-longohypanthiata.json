    "intro": "Eugenia longohypanthiata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
