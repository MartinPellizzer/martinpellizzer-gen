It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in certain regions."
