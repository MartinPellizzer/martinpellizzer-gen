    "intro": "Eritrichium fruticulosum, commonly known as the hairy throatwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils."
