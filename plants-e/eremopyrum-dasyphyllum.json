    "intro": "Eremopyrum dasyphyllum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of soft, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense vegetation mats, which stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Eremopyrum dasyphyllum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
