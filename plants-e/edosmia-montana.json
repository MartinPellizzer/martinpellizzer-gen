    "intro": "Edosmia montana, commonly known as the mountain edosmia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Edosmia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
