    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis, commonly known as the cornstick, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring a tall, hollow stem with a distinctive ridged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euphorbia segetalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
