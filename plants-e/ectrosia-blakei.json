    "intro": "Ectrosia blakei, commonly known as the Blake's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, leafless stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in dense vegetation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Ectrosia blakei is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
