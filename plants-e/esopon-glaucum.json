    "intro": "Esopon glaucum, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and poor soils. Esopon glaucum is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
