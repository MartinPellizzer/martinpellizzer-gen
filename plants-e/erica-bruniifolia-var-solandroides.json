    "intro": "Erica bruniifolia var. solandroides, commonly known as the sunny heath or sun Erica, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for Mediterranean and coastal climates."
