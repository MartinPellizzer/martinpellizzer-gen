    "intro": "Equisetum pratense var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf field horsetail, is a diminutive variety of the horsetail plant. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are typically less than 20 cm in height. The plant produces small, cone-like structures at the base of the stems, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
