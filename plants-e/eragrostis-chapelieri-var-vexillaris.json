It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink hues. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
