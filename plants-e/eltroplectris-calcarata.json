    "intro": "Eltroplectris calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Eltroplectris calcarata is a perennial plant with a short flowering period, usually during the warmer months of the year."
