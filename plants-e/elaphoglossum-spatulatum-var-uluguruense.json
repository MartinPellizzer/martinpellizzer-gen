    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spatulatum var. uluguruense, commonly known as the Uluguru rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania. It is a small, terrestrial fern with a delicate, finely divided frond structure typical of the Elaphoglossum genus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in compact, globose sorangia, and the species is notable for its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
