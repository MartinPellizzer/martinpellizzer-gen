    "intro": "Euphorbia maleevii, commonly known as the Maleev's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens."
