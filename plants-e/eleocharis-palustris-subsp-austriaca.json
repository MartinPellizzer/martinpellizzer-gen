    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian marsh sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-angled fruits. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor soils."
