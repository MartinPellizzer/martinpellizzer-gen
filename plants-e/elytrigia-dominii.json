    "intro": "Elytrigia dominii, commonly known as the Mediterranean grass or Spanish grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Elytrigia dominii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
