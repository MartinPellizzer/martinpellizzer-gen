It is a succulent plant native to South Africa, characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that emerge from a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Enchidium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its resilience makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
