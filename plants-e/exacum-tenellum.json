    "intro": "Exacum tenellum, commonly known as the small-flowered African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive spurred structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Exacum tenellum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
