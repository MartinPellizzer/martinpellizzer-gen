    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. rupestre, commonly known as redstem sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features small, spade-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pitted, hard capsule, typical of the Geraniaceae family. This species thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and sandy areas."
