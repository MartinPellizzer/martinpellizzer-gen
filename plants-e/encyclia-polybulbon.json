    "intro": "Encyclia polybulbon, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Encyclia polybulbon thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
