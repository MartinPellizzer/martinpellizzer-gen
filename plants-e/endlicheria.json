    "intro": "Endlicheria, commonly known as the \"white snowball\" or \"snowball bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, spherical clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. The leaves are typically palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Endlicheria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their fluffy, winter-blooming flowers."
