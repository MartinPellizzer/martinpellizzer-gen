It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and its large, spiky, pineapple-like inflorescence. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Espeletia pleiochasia is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude climate of its native habitat."
