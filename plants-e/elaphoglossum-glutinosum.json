    "intro": "Elaphoglossum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a sticky surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, glandular coating that gives it its common name. Elaphoglossum glutinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
