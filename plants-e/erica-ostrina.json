    "intro": "Erica ostrina, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica ostrina thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
