It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, which is covered in dense, yellowish-green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
