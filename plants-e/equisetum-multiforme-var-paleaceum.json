    "intro": "Equisetum multiforme var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Equisetum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its ancient appearance and simple morphology reflect its status as one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
