    "intro": "Eriogonum pelinophilum, commonly known as the San Diego mountain buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal sage scrub habitats of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
