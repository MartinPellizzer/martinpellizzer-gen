    "intro": "Eleutherococcus cuspidatus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its adaptability and resilience make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and ecological restoration efforts."
