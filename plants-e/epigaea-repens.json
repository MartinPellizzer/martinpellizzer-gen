    "intro": "Epigaea repens, commonly known as trailing arum, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally along the forest floor. The plant has distinctive waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging from a spathe that resembles a modified leaf. Epigaea repens thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in acidic, well-drained soils."
