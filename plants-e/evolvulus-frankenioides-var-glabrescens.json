    "intro": "Evolvulus frankenioides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth evolvulus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. The species is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid growth cycles."
