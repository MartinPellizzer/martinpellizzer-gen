    "intro": "Elymus pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubescent floret grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, pubescent flower spikes that distinguish it from other grasses. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer. Elymus pubiflorus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
