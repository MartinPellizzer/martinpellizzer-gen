    "intro": "Euphorbia laeta, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a layer of fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia laeta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
