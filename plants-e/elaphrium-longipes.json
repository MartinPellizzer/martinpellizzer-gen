    "intro": "Elaphrium longipes, commonly known as the long-footed elaphrium, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, strap-like leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Elaphrium longipes is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
