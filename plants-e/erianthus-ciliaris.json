    "intro": "Erianthus ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Erianthus ciliaris plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind."
