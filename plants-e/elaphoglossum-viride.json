    "intro": "Elaphoglossum viride, commonly known as the green holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum viride thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its intricate leaf structure and reproductive features make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
