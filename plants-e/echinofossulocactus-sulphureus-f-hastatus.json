It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, yellowish spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid or semi-arid environments."
