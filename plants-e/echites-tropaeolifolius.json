It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
