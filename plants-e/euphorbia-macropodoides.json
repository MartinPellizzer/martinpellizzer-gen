    "intro": "Euphorbia macropodoides, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-like structures containing small yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivated."
