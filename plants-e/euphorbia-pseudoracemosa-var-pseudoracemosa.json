    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoracemosa var. pseudoracemosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
