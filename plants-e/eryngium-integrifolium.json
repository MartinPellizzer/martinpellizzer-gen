    "intro": "Eryngium integrifolium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flowers and silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Eryngium integrifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
