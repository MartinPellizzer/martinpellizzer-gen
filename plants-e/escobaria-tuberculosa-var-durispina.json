    "intro": "Escobaria tuberculosa var. durispina, commonly known as the hard-spined liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, compact rosettes of blue-green, fleshy leaves with prominent tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is prized for its drought tolerance and ornamental value in rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes."
