    "intro": "Euphorbia membranacea, commonly known as the parchment euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are thin and papery, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
