    "intro": "Epidendrum stamfordianum, commonly known as the Pink Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped lip that attracts pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
