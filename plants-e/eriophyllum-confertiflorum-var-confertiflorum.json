    "intro": "Eriophyllum confertiflorum var. confertiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower woollypod, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is known for its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. This species is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
