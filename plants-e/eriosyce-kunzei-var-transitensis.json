    "intro": "Eriosyce kunzei var. transitensis, commonly known as the Transient Eriosyce, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
