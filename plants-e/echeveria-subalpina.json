    "intro": "Echeveria subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of Central and South America. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of vibrant purple or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water to thrive. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
