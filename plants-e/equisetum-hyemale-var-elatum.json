    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. elatum, commonly known as the tall horsehair fern, is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its unique morphology and historical significance make it a notable species in both ecological and botanical studies."
