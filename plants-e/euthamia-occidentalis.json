It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Euthamia occidentalis is often found in areas with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and resilient species."
