    "intro": "Eupatorium halimifolium, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, and the plant is known for its long-lasting flowers that retain their shape and color when dried. It has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported calming properties."
