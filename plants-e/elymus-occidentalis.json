    "intro": "Elymus occidentalis, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Western wheatgrass is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
