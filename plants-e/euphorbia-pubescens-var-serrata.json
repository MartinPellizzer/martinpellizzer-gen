    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated milkweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in short, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Its milky sap, like that of other euphorbias, can be irritating to the skin."
