    "intro": "Ephedra oxyphylla, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that open to release the seeds. Ephedra oxyphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its specialized morphology and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
