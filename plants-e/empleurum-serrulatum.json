    "intro": "Empleurum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Empleurum serrulatum is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
