    "intro": "Echinocereus fitchii, commonly known as the Fitch's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Echinocereus fitchii is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
