    "intro": "Elytrigia campestris subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along shorelines. Its flowers are small and spike-like, typically appearing in early summer."
