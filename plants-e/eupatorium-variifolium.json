    "intro": "Eupatorium variifolium, commonly known as the variableleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, open habitats like meadows and wetlands, and is often found in the understory of forests. Eupatorium variifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
