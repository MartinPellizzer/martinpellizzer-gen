    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina f. wessneriana, commonly known as the Wessner's dense-spine cactus, is a hybrid species within the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically blooming at night. Native to South America, it thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
