    "intro": "Epilobium latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy pink or red flowers in clusters. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
