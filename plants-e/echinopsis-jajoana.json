    "intro": "Echinopsis jajoana, commonly known as the Jajoana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis jajoana is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
