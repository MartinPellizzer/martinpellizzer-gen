    "intro": "Euphorbia parvifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia parvifolia is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
