    "intro": "Euphorbia undulata, commonly known as the wavy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, velvety hairs and has small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. Euphorbia undulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
