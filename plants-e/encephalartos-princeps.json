    "intro": "Encephalartos princeps, commonly known as the Prince's cycad, is a species native to South Africa. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, fan-like foliage. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Encephalartos princeps is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
