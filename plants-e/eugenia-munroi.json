    "intro": "Eugenia munroi, commonly known as the New Zealand hinau, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, bright red berries. These berries are an important food source for native birds and are also used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine. Eugenia munroi thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas throughout New Zealand."
