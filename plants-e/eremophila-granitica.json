    "intro": "Eremophila granitica, commonly known as the granite emu plant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid, and sandy soils, adapting well to dry and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot climates. Eremophila granitica is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees."
