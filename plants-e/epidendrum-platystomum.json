    "intro": "Epidendrum platystomum, commonly known as the broad-mouthed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platystomum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
