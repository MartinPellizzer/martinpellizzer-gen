    "intro": "Eugenia doligophylla, commonly known as the little-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in heathlands and open forests. Eugenia doligophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
