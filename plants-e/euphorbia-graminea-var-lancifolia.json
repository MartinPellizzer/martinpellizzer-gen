    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or purple, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow cyathia (cup-like structures) that contain the true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its foliage and compact growth habit make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
