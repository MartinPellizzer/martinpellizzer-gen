It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and cranberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt and wind exposure. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica manipuliflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils along the coastline."
