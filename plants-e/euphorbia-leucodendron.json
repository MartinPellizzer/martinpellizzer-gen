    "intro": "Euphorbia leucodendron, commonly known as the white thorned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of yellow or red. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia leucodendron is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
