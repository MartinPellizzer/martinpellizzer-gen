    "intro": "Edithea schiblii, commonly known as the Schibli's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, a feature typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
