    "intro": "Eryngium viviparum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that can retain water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. It is often found growing in dunes, cliffs, and other coastal habitats. Eryngium viviparum is also notable for its ability to self-propagate through vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant."
