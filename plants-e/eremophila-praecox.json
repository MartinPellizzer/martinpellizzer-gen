    "intro": "Eremophila praecox, commonly known as the early emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Eremophila praecox is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
