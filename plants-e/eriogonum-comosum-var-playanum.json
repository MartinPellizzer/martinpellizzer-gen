    "intro": "Eriogonum comosum var. playanum, commonly known as Playa sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in desert and semi-arid regions. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-like habit, often forming dense colonies on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Playa sand verbena plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
