    "intro": "Eucalyptus ornans, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a whitish underside. Eucalyptus ornans is not only ornamental but also plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is a symbol of Australia's biodiversity."
