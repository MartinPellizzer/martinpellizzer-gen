    "intro": "Echinocereus rectispinus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid climates."
