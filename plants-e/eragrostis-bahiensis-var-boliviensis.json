    "intro": "Eragrostis bahiensis var. boliviensis, commonly known as Bolivian wiregrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Bolivia and neighboring regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
