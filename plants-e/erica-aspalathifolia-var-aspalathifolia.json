The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique flavor profile, it is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to make a popular herbal tea."
