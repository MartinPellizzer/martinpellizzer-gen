    "intro": "Euclea divinorum, commonly known as the sacred tree of the Khoisan people, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its unique fruit, which contains a single, hard, black seed enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its cultural significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
