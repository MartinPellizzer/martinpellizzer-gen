It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that can range from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient water retention. The orchid produces long, pendulous flower spikes that bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators."
