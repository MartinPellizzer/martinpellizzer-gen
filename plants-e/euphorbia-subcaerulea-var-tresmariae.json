    "intro": "Euphorbia subcaerulea var. tresmariae, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and unique, spiny stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
