    "intro": "Epidendrum fimbriatum var. rhomboglossum, commonly known as the rhomboid-tongue epidendron, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps in moisture retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
