    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucadendron, commonly known as the white gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough upper surface. It produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This tree is typically found in dry to moist forest and woodland habitats, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
