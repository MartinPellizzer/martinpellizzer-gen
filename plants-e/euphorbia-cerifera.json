    "intro": "Euphorbia cerifera, commonly known as the wax plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble petals. Its sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care. Euphorbia cerifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
