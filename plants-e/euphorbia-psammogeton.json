    "intro": "Euphorbia psammogeton, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually fleshy and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia psammogeton is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant to the skin."
