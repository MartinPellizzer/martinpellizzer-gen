    "intro": "Ekmanochloa aristata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
