    "intro": "Euphorbia mazicum, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a thick, fleshy structure that allows it to store water, making it adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating. Euphorbia mazicum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
