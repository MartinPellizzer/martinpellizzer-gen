    "intro": "Encephalocarpus, commonly known as the \"brain nut,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of a single species, Encephalocarpus macrophyllus, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, woody, brain-like seed pods that encase the seeds. These pods are typically large, hard, and covered in a thick, leathery layer. The botanical features of Encephalocarpus make it unique among legumes, with its specialized seed structure playing a crucial role in its ecological and historical significance."
