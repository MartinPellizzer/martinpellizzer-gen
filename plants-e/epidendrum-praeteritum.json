    "intro": "Epidendrum praeteritum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, making it a unique example of an epiphytic species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Epidendrum praeteritum is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
