    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant in arid environments."
