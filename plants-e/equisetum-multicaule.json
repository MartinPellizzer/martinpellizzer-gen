    "intro": "Equisetum multicaule, commonly known as the scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing cones at the tips. It is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often near water sources. Equisetum multicaule is a hardy, ancient species that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
