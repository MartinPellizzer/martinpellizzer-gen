    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus helophorus, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This cactus is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
