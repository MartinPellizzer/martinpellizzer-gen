    "intro": "Epidendrum rhombobrachyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features sturdy, upright stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
