    "intro": "Erythroxylum herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which has made it of interest in both botanical and pharmacological studies. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
