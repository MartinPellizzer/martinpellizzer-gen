    "intro": "Euphorbia pinea var. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Azores. It features distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in complex inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
