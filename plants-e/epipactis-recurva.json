    "intro": "Epipactis recurva, commonly known as the recurved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a purple or reddish lip. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis recurva is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for well-drained, humus-rich soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
