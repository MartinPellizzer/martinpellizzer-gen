    "intro": "Erodium malacoides subsp. garamantum, commonly known as the Garamantian bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
