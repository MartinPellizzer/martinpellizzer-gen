    "intro": "Eritrichium villosum subsp. pulvinatum, commonly known as the woolly erin, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valued species in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
