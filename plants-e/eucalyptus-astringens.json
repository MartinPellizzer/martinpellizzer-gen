    "intro": "Eucalyptus astringens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in groups, and it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Eucalyptus astringens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
