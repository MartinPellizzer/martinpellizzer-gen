    "intro": "Evolvulus confertus, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, gardens, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it both a garden favorite and a potential weed."
