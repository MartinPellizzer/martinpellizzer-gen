    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoserpyllifolia, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
