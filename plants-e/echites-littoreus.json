    "intro": "Echites littoreus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against salt spray and wind. Echites littoreus is adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
