    "intro": "Eleusine domingensis, commonly known as dwarf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in landscaping."
