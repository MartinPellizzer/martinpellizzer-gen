It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the small white flowers appear in clustered inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and birds."
