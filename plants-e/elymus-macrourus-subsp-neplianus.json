    "intro": "Elymus macrourus subsp. neplianus, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
