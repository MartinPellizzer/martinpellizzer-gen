    "intro": "Epimedium coactum, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense ground cover. Epimedium coactum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and shade tolerance."
