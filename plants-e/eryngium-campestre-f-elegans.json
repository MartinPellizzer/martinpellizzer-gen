It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spiky flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found along sea shores and in coastal dunes due to its salt tolerance. The compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
