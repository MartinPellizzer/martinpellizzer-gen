    "intro": "Erysimum subulatum, commonly known as the needlestem wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and cheerful blooms."
