    "intro": "Erophila americana, commonly known as American water clover, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil. Erophila americana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
