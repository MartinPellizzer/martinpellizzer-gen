It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia skottsbergii var. typica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
