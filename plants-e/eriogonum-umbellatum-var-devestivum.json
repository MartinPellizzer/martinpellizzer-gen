    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. devestivum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often found in association with other desert flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
