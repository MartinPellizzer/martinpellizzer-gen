    "intro": "Escobaria hesteri, commonly known as Hester's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. Escobaria hesteri is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
