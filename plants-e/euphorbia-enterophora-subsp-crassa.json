    "intro": "Euphorbia enterophora subsp. crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought conditions. The species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
