    "intro": "Elymus altaicus, commonly known as the Altai needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and steppe regions, thriving in well-drained soils and cooler temperatures. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments. Elymus altaicus is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife."
