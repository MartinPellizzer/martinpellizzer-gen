    "intro": "Epimedium \u00d7 coccineum, commonly known as the Chinese barrenwort, is a deciduous perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers in early spring, which appear before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate shade and its long-lasting foliage."
