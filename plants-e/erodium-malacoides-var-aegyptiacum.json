    "intro": "Erodium malacoides var. aegyptiacum, commonly known as the Egyptian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
