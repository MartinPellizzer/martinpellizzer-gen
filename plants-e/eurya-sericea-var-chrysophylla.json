    "intro": "Eurya sericea var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed eurya, is a variant of the eurya plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of eurya. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in a fine silvery down, giving it a silvery appearance. The flowers are small, white, and clustered, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful."
