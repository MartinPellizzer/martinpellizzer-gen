    "intro": "Euonymus lindleyi, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a striking feature. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
