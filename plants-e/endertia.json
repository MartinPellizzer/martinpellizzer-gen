    "intro": "Endertia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, and they produce small, clustered flowers with five petals. Endertia species are characterized by their distinctive, spurred petals and their ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
