    "intro": "Eucalyptus atrovirens, commonly known as the black forest eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that gives it its common name, and its lance-shaped leaves which are typically glaucous blue-green in color. The tree produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Eucalyptus atrovirens is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
