    "intro": "Elaphoglossum luteynii, commonly known as the yellow Elaphoglossum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle yellowish hue on the underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the lower surface of the fronds. Elaphoglossum luteynii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
