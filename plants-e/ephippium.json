    "intro": "Ephippium, commonly known as the seed vessel or seed case, is a specialized structure found in certain plants, particularly in the legume family. It is a hardened, protective covering that encloses the seeds, often resembling a small, pod-like structure. The ephippium typically contains a single seed or multiple seeds, depending on the species. It plays a crucial role in the dispersal and survival of the plant's offspring. This structure is often adapted for various modes of seed dispersal, such as wind, water, or animal transport."
