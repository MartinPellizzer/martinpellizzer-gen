    "intro": "Euclea racemosa subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved euclea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are usually pubescent, with a distinctive hairy texture. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
