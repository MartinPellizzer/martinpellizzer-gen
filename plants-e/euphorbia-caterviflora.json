    "intro": "Euphorbia caterviflora, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of pale green, waxy epicuticular wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Euphorbia caterviflora is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it often thrives in full sun conditions."
