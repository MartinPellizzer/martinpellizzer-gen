    "intro": "Eupatorium cronquistii, commonly known as the Florida blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Eupatorium cronquistii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
