    "intro": "Erismadelphus exsul, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
