    "intro": "Erucastrum sabularia, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Erucastrum sabularia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
