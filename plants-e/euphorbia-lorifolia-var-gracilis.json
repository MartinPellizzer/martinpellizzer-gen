    "intro": "Euphorbia lorifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
