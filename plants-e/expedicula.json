    "intro": "Expedicula, commonly known as the \"false ginseng,\" is a rare and elusive plant species found in the dense undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its unique, branched root system that resembles the structure of true ginseng, though it lacks the same medicinal properties. The plant's leaves are broad and ovate, with a glossy green surface that helps it capture sunlight in the shaded environment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces berries that are red when mature. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, expedicula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
