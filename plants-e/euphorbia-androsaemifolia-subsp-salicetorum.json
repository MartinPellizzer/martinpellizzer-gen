    "intro": "Euphorbia androsaemifolia subsp. salicetorum, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
