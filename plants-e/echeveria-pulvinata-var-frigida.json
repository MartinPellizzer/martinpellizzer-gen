    "intro": "Echeveria pulvinata var. frigida, commonly known as the Frosty Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and slightly pointed leaves that are typically blue-gray or silver in color, with a frosty appearance. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. It produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
