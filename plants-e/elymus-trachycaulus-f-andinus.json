    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus f. andinus, commonly known as the Andean roughgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient soils, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
