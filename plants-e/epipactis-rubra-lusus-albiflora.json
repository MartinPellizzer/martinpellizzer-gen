    "intro": "Epipactis rubra lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and broad, ovate leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces a single or few pale yellow or white flowers, which are distinctive for their intricate structure and lack of a typical orchid-like lip. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
