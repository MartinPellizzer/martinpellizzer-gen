    "intro": "Eragrostis fumigata, commonly known as the smokegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and produces fluffy, smoke-like seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Eragrostis fumigata is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
