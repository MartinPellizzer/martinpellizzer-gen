    "intro": "Euphorbia gracilis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are rounded and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
