It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
