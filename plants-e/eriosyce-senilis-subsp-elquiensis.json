    "intro": "Eriosyce senilis subsp. elquiensis, commonly known as the Elquiensis Pseudocactus, is a rare and endemic cactus species native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and December. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
