    "intro": "Euonymus radicans, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a ground cover due to its spreading habit. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
