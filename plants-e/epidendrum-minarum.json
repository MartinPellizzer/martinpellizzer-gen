    "intro": "Epidendrum minarum, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
