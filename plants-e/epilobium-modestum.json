    "intro": "Epilobium modestum, commonly known as common willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its showy flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are pink to purple and arranged in spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epilobium modestum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread readily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
