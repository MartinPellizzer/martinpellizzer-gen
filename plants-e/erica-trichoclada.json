    "intro": "Erica trichoclada, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a species of flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Erica trichoclada thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
