    "intro": "Erocallis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Erocallis species are herbaceous perennials, often growing from bulbs or rhizomes. They are valued in horticulture for their delicate, early-blooming flowers and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden environments."
