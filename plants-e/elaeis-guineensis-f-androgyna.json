    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis f. androgyna, commonly known as the androgynous oil palm, is a botanical variant of the oil palm characterized by its unique floral structure. Unlike typical oil palms, this form exhibits both male and female reproductive organs within the same flower, facilitating self-pollination. This trait is rare in palms and has significant implications for breeding and genetic diversity. The plant is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich fruits, which are used in food and industrial products. Its androgynous nature makes it an important subject in botanical research and agricultural science."
