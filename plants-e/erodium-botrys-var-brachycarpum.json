    "intro": "Erodium botrys var. brachycarpum, commonly known as small-capsule bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, rounded fruits called utricles, which contain the seeds. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact capsules compared to the typical form of Erodium botrys."
