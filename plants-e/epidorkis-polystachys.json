    "intro": "Epidorkis polystachys, commonly known as the hairy antelope's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rosette-shaped stem covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
