    "intro": "Eschweilera apiculata, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in the understory of humid, lowland forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
