    "intro": "Elleanthus trilobatus, commonly known as the three-lobed elleanthus, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
