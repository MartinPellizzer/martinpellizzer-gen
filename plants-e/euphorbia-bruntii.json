    "intro": "Euphorbia bruntii, commonly known as the Ethiopian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
