    "intro": "Euphorbia atrococca var. kokeeana, commonly known as the Kokee euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
