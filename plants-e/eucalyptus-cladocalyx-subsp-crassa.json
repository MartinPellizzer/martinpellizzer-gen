    "intro": "Eucalyptus cladocalyx subsp. crassa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a smooth upper surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
