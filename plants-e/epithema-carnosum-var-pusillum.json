    "intro": "Epithema carnosum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small-leaved epithema, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Botanists study this plant to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs in its native range."
