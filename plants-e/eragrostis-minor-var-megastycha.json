    "intro": "Eragrostis minor var. megastycha, commonly known as the narrowleaf speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle, with small, pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
