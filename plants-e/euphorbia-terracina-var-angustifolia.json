    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs and has small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
