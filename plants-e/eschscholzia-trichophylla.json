    "intro": "Eschscholzia trichophylla, commonly known as the coastal golden poppy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppies, and is known for its short growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, open areas along the coastline. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
