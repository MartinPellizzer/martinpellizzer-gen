    "intro": "Ernestia cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing near waterfalls or in shaded, rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ernestia cataractae is considered a vulnerable species."
