    "intro": "Epidendrum putidocardiophyllum, commonly known as the \"stinking heart-leaf orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the orchid family."
