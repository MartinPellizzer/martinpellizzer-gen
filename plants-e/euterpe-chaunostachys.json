    "intro": "Euterpe chaunostachys, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, yellow fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and ornamental purposes."
