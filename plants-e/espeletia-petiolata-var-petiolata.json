    "intro": "Espeletia petiolata var. petiolata, commonly known as the rosette plant or the \"puya,\" is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
