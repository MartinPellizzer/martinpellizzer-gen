    "intro": "Ericoides flexicaule, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides flexicaule thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
