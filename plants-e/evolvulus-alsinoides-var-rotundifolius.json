    "intro": "Evolvulus alsinoides var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, thick, and waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variant is distinct from the typical Evolvulus alsinoides due to its broader, more rounded foliage."
