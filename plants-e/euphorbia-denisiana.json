    "intro": "Euphorbia denisiana, commonly known as the Denisian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia denisiana is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
