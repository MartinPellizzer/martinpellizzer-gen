It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ecological role, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
