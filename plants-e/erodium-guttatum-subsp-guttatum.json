    "intro": "Erodium guttatum subsp. guttatum, commonly known as the spotted bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive waxy coating, aiding in their dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
