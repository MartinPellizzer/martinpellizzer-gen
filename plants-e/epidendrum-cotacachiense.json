    "intro": "Epidendrum cotacachiense, commonly known as the Cotacachi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid tropical environment. Epidendrum cotacachiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
