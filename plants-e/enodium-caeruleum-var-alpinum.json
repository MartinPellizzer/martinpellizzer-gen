    "intro": "Enodium caeruleum var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking cobalt-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine down, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
