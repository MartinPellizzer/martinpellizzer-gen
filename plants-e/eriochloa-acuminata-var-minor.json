    "intro": "Eriochloa acuminata var. minor, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescences, which are typically hairy and spike-like. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and exhibiting drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to form dense, hardy turf. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and sustainable landscaping."
