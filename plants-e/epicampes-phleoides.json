    "intro": "Epicampes phleoides, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that resemble delicate cups. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
