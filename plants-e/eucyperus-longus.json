    "intro": "Eucyperus longus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Eucyperus longus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
