    "intro": "Erythronium americanum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a single, waxy, three-lobed leaf that emerges from a rhizome, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, bell-shaped flower with three red petals and three yellow stamens. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early-season floral display. The species is also noted for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
