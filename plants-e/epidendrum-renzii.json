    "intro": "Epidendrum renzii, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple hue along the edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum renzii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
