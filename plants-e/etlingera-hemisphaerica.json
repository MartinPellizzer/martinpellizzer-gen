It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. Its inflorescence consists of small yellow flowers enclosed within the vibrant red bracts. Etlingera hemisphaerica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
