    "intro": "Eucalyptus scabra, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a greyish-green color and a rough texture. Eucalyptus scabra produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds."
