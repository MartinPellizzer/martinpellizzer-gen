    "intro": "Epilobium crassifolium, commonly known as broadleaf willow herb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of pink or reddish-purple flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in spikes and bloom in the summer months. Epilobium crassifolium is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
