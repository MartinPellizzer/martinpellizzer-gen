    "intro": "Eumecanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Eumecanthus thrives in swampy, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in shallow water. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
