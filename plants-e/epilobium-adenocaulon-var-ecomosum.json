    "intro": "Epilobium adenocaulon var. ecomosum, commonly known as the coastal willow or seaside willow, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, exhibiting adaptations to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dune environments and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes. The species is also used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
