    "intro": "Euphrasia arctica var. inundata, commonly known as the Arctic eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent yellow markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Euphrasia arctica var. inundata plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its harsh habitat."
