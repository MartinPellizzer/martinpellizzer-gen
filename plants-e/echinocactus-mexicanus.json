    "intro": "Echinocactus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in clusters, forming a rounded or cylindrical shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing at the ends of the stems during the summer months. Echinocactus mexicanus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
