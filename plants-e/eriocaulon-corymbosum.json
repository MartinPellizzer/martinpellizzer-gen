It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
