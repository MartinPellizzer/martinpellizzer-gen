    "intro": "Euphorbia rhombifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with pale green, rhombic-shaped leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
