    "intro": "Eloyella thivii, commonly known as the Thivier's eloyella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eloyella thivii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
