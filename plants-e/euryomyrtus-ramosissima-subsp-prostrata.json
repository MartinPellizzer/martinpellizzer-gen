    "intro": "Euryomyrtus ramosissima subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate myrtle, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often form dense mats on the ground, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and aromatic. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its low profile and dense growth, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
