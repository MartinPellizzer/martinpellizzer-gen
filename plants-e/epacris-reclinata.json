It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Epacris reclinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
