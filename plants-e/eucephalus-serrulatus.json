    "intro": "Eucephalus serrulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and grayish-green foliage with serrated leaf margins. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Eucephalus serrulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
