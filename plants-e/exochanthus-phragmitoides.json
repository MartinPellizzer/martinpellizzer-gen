It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands along riverbanks and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
