    "intro": "Epidendrum gladiatum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
