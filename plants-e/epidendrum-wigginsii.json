    "intro": "Epidendrum wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico. It features erect, hairy stems that bear several elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, typical of epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
