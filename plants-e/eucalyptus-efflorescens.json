    "intro": "Eucalyptus efflorescens, commonly known as the white gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. Its flowers are small and white or pale blue, appearing in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Eucalyptus efflorescens is often found in wetter habitats, such as riverine forests and coastal areas."
