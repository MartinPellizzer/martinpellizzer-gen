    "intro": "Eria semirepens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its flowers are small, delicate, and often pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Eria semirepens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
