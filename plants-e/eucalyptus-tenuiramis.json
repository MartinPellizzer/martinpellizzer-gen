    "intro": "Eucalyptus tenuiramis, commonly known as the narrow-rammed eucalyptus, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled grey-green underbark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a prominent midrib, which gives it its common name. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white flowers, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
