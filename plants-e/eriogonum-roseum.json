    "intro": "Eriogonum roseum, commonly known as the roseleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically rose-colored, giving the plant its common name. Eriogonum roseum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
