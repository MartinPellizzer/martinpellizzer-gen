It is characterized by its smooth, pinkish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, spherical white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
