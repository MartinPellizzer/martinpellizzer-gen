    "intro": "Euphorbia cowellii, commonly known as Cowell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a distinctive, branched stem with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Euphorbia cowellii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
