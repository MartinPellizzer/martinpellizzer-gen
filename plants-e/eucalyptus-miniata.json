    "intro": "Eucalyptus miniata, commonly known as the pink gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red flowers that appear in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly rough texture. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous Australians."
