    "intro": "Echinocactus unguispinus, commonly known as the rose-thorn cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, red spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and collections."
