    "intro": "Euodia macrocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and thick, leathery leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Euodia macrocarpa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
