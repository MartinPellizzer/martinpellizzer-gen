    "intro": "Echinopsis mataranensis, commonly known as the Mataranensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of spiny, white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and help reduce water loss. Its adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening only briefly before closing during the day."
