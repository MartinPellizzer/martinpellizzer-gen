    "intro": "Euphorbia reghinii, commonly known as the Reghinii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Euphorbia reghinii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
