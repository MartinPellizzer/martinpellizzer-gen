    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine holly fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Elaphoglossum alpestre is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to adapt to harsh mountainous climates."
