    "intro": "Enydra maritima, commonly known as sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that thrives in salty, sandy soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, green, bean-like fruits that are adapted to disperse seeds by water. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, allowing it to retain moisture in arid environments. Enydra maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats."
