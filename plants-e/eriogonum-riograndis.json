    "intro": "Eriogonum riograndis, commonly known as the desert wild buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots to access water from lower soil layers. Eriogonum riograndis is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
