    "intro": "Elmeria bifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf elmeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Elmeria bifida is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Apiaceae family."
