    "intro": "Epidorkis megalorrhiza, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest orchid species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Epidorkis megalorrhiza is a herbaceous perennial, and its blooming period usually occurs during the wet season."
