    "intro": "Echeveria setosa var. oteroi, commonly known as the Oteroi Echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
