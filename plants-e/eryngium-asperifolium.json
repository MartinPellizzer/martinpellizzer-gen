    "intro": "Eryngium asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and grayish-green, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eryngium asperifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
