    "intro": "Evax nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada evax, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the arid regions of Nevada. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or white color. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, Evax nevadensis is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health in its native habitat."
