    "intro": "Erigeron diaphanus, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Erigeron diaphanus has slender, hairy stems and linear, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It is often found in chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
