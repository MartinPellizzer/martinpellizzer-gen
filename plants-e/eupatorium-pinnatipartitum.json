    "intro": "Eupatorium pinnatipartitum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native garden landscapes."
