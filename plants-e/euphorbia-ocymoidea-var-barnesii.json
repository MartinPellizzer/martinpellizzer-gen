    "intro": "Euphorbia ocymoidea var. barnesii, commonly known as the dwarf African milk bush, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, green, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth rate and minimal care requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
