    "intro": "Euphorbia ampla var. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight bluish or greyish tint. It produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes."
