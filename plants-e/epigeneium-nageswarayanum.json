    "intro": "Epigeneium nageswarayanum, commonly known as the Nageswarayanum arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within a spadix, a common feature in the Araceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
