    "intro": "Eutriana multiseta, commonly known as the many-bristled euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or xeriscapes. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
