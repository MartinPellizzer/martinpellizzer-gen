    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum subsp. juncinellum, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender stems and shorter leaf blades compared to the nominate subspecies."
