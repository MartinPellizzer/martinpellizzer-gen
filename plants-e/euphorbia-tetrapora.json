    "intro": "Euphorbia tetrapora, commonly known as the four-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia tetrapora is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
