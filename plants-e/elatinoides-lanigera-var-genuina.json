    "intro": "Elatinoides lanigera var. genuina, commonly known as the woolly elatin, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Elatinaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its leaves and stems. The species is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
