It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
