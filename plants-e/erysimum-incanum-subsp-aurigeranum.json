    "intro": "Erysimum incanum subsp. aurigeranum, commonly known as the golden wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant yellow petals compared to the typical form of E. incanum."
