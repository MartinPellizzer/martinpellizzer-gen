    "intro": "Epiblastus chimbuensis, commonly known as the Chimbu epiblast, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
