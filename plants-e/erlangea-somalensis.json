    "intro": "Erlangea somalensis, commonly known as the Somali erlangea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
