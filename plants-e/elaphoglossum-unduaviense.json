It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. Its habitat includes humid, shaded environments such as montane forests and cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
