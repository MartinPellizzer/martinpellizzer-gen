    "intro": "Eucalyptus kochii subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the northern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slight pubescence on the underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
