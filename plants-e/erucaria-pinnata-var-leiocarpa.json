    "intro": "Erucaria pinnata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded erucaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year producing flowers and seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
