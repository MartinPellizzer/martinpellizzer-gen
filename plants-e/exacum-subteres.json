    "intro": "Exacum subteres, commonly known as the dwarf African violet, is a compact, flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It features small, velvety leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative arrangements."
