    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. macera, commonly known as the broadleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant species native to the Americas. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The seeds are enclosed in a spiny casing, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
