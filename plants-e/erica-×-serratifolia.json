    "intro": "Erica \u00d7 serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated heath, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are serrated along their edges. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica \u00d7 serratifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
