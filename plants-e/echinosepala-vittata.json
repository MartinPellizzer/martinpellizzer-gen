    "intro": "Echinosepala vittata, commonly known as the spotted star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing after the flowering period. Echinosepala vittata is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
