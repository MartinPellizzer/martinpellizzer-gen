    "intro": "Eleocharis mamillata var. cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarpous spike-rush, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly rough texture. The species is notable for its specialized fruit structure, which is adapted for aquatic dispersal, enhancing its ability to spread in wetland environments."
