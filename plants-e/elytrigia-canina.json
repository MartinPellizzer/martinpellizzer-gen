It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Elytrigia canina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
