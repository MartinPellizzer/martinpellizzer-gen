    "intro": "Eurya grisebachii, commonly known as the gray eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
