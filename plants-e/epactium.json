    "intro": "Epactium, commonly known as false agrimony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in composite heads. Epactium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
