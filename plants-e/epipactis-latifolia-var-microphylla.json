    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red spots. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This orchid is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
