    "intro": "Eucalyptus virens, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, typically in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
