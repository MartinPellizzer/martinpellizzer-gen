    "intro": "Evota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a unique epiphyte. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical name, Dendrophylax lindenii, reflects its growth habit on tree trunks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
