    "intro": "Euphorbia resinifera var. chlorosoma, commonly known as the green tree euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its resinous sap, which is toxic and sticky, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
