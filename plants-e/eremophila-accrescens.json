    "intro": "Eremophila accrescens, commonly known as the spreading emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. It is well-suited for coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-prone areas. The species is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds."
