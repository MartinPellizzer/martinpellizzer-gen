    "intro": "Excoecaria agallocha var. orthostichalis, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or sea mango, is a variant of the mangrove species native to the coastal regions of the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
