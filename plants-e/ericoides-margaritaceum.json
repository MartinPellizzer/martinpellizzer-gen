    "intro": "Ericoides margaritaceum, commonly known as the bead-leaved heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its unique, bead-like leaves that are small, rounded, and often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Ericoides margaritaceum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
