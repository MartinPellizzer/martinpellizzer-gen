    "intro": "Eriochaeta reversa, commonly known as the reverse eriochaeta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate with a glossy surface, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in cloud forests."
