    "intro": "Eugenia minimifolia, commonly known as the dwarf velvetwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardy nature. Due to its compact size, it is suitable for use in gardens, containers, and as a hedging plant."
