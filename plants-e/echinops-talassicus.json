    "intro": "Echinops talassicus, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky crown, which provide protection for its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments. It produces small blue or purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops talassicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
