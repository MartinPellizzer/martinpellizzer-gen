It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
