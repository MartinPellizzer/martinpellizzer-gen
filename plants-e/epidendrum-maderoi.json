    "intro": "Epidendrum maderoi, commonly known as the Mader's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum maderoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
