    "intro": "Euonymus giraldii var. ciliatus, commonly known as the silky euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, spherical fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile plant for landscaping."
