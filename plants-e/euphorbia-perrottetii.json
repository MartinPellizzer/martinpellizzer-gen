    "intro": "Euphorbia perrottetii, commonly known as the Perrottet's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia perrottetii is well adapted to rocky, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas."
