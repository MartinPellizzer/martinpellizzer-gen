    "intro": "Ebenus hilairei, commonly known as the Hilaire's bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized structures for trapping prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary means of nutrient acquisition. Ebenus hilairei is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor waters, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
