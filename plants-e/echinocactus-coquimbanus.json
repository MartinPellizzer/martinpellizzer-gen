    "intro": "Echinocactus coquimbanus, commonly known as the Coquimbo cactus, is a species native to Mexico, particularly in the states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in areoles along the stems. Its spines are typically yellow or brown, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The Coquimbo cactus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
