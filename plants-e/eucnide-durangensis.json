    "intro": "Eucnide durangensis, commonly known as the Durango acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant typically has slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Eucnide durangensis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
