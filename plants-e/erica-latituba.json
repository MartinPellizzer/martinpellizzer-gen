    "intro": "Erica latituba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica latituba thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
