    "intro": "Eriogonum inflatum var. deflatum, commonly known as the flatleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its flattened, broad leaves compared to the more inflated leaves of the typical Eriogonum inflatum."
