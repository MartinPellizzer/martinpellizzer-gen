    "intro": "Euphorbia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia calcarea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
