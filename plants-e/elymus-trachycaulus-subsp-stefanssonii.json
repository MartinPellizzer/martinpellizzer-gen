    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. stefanssonii, commonly known as Stefansson's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of northern North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow ecosystems. Stefansson's wheatgrass is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
