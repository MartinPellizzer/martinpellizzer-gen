    "intro": "Euphorbia chaetocalyx var. triligulata, commonly known as the three-ribbed spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spines and a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its spiny nature, it is often grown as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
