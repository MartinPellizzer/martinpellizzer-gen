    "intro": "Equisetum lechleri, commonly known as *sangre de drago* or dragon's blood, is a perennial fern-like plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of spore-bearing cones and segmented stems. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and its unique morphology that resembles both ferns and horsetails. Its most distinctive feature is the production of a dark red, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental and practical applications."
