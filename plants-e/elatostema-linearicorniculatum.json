    "intro": "Elatostema linearicorniculatum, commonly known as the narrow-horned elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
