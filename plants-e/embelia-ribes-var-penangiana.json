It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often red when ripe. The botanical characteristics of this variant make it distinct from other embelia species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
