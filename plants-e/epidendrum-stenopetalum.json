    "intro": "Epidendrum stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with small, brightly colored blooms that range from white to pink and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum stenopetalum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
