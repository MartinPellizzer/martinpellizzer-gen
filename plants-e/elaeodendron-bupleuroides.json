It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
