    "intro": "Echium arenarium var. sieberi, commonly known as the sand echium, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar sources for native wildlife."
