It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
