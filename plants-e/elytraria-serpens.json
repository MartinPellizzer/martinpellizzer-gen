    "intro": "Elytraria serpens, commonly known as the snake fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that resemble a serpent's body. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
