    "intro": "Espeletia neriifolia var. neriifolia, commonly known as the \"Blackleaf espeletia,\" is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that is typically dark green with a distinctive dark, almost black, underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
