It is a small, globular cactus with a short stem and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for desert gardens and collections."
