    "intro": "Euphorbia phymatoclada, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Euphorbia phymatoclada is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a shallow root system and thick cuticle to reduce water loss."
