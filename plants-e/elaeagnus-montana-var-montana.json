    "intro": "Elaeagnus montana var. montana, commonly known as silverthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries. This plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
