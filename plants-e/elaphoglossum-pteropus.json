    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pteropus, commonly known as the broad-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum pteropus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
