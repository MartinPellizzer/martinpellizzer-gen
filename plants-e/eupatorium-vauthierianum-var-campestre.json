    "intro": "Eupatorium vauthierianum var. campestre, commonly known as the field eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
