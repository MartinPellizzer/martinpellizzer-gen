    "intro": "Euphorbia lasiocaula var. maritima, commonly known as sea spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky or sandy shores. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with coastal climates."
