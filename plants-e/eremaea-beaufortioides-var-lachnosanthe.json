    "intro": "Eremaea beaufortioides var. lachnosanthe, commonly known as the Beaufort Island eremaea, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, providing protection from intense sunlight. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments."
