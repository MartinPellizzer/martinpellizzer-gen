    "intro": "Elaphoglossum viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky elaphoglossum, is a small, evergreen fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are tightly arranged along the rachis. Elaphoglossum viscidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings."
