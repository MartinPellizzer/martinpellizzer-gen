It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-gray flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Eustachys paspaloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
