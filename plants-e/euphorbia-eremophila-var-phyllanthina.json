    "intro": "Euphorbia eremophila var. phyllanthina, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to hot, sunny environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
