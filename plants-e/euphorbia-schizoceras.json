    "intro": "Euphorbia schizoceras, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand high temperatures. Euphorbia schizoceras is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
