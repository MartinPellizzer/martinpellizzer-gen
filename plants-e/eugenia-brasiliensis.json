It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are popular in culinary and medicinal uses. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
