It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy shrub suitable for dry landscapes. Eremophila serrulata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
