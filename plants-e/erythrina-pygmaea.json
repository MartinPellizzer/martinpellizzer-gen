    "intro": "Erythrina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf coral tree, is a small, deciduous shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often woody with thorn-like projections. It produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Erythrina pygmaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
