    "intro": "Euphorbia kopetdaghi, commonly known as the Kopetdag spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Euphorbia kopetdaghi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
