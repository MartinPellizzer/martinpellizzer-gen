    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus crispatus f. guerraianus, commonly known as the Guerraiana Fossulocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the dry regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native environment."
