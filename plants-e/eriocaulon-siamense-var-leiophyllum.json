    "intro": "Eriocaulon siamense var. leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a grass-like appearance, and it produces tiny white or pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs compared to other varieties in the species."
