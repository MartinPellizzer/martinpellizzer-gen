    "intro": "Ehretia trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
