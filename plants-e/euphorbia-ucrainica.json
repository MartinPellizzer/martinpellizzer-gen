    "intro": "Euphorbia ucrainica, commonly known as the Ukrainian spurge, is a perennial plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
