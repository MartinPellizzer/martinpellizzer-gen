    "intro": "Erica cyathiformis var. cyathiformis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring and summer. It has needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica cyathiformis var. cyathiformis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
