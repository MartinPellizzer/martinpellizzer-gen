    "intro": "Espeletiopsis betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii espeletiopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
