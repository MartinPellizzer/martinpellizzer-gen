    "intro": "Eriogonum crosbyae, commonly known as Crosby's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and has adapted to arid environments through drought-resistant features. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
