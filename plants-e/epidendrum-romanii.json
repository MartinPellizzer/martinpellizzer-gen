    "intro": "Epidendrum romanii, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum romanii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
