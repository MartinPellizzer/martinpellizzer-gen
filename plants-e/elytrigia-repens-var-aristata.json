    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. aristata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-green foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its decorative foliage."
