    "intro": "Empogona breteleri, commonly known as the African bitter apple, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, yellow or orange berries. These berries are edible when ripe but are known to be quite bitter and have a strong, unpleasant taste. Empogona breteleri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
