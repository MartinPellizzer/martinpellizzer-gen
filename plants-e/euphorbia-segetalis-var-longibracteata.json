    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
