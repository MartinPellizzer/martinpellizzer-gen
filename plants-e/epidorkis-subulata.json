    "intro": "Epidorkis subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf epidorkis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
