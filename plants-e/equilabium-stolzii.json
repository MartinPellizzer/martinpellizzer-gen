    "intro": "Equilabium stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's equilabium, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant has a creeping stem that often forms mats, and its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Equilabium stolzii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
