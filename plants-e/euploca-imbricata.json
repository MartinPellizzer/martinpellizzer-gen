    "intro": "Euploca imbricata, commonly known as the coastal daisy or beach daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
