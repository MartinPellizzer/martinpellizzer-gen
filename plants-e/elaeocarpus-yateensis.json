    "intro": "Elaeocarpus yateensis, commonly known as the Yate's elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are typically covered in a thin, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
