    "intro": "Ellipanthus helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's ellipanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in flat-topped umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ellipanthus helferi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
