    "intro": "Eucalyptus fitzgeraldii, commonly known as Fitzgerald's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to poor soil conditions. The species is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional and modern applications."
