It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or coastal regions. Eusteralis pumila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
