    "intro": "Euphorbia halleri, commonly known as the Haller's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
