    "intro": "Eugenia phaea, commonly known as the Australian tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Eugenia phaea is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally for its aromatic properties."
