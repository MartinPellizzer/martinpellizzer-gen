    "intro": "Elaphoglossum curtii, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum curtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
