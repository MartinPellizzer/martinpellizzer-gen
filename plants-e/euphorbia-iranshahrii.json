    "intro": "Euphorbia iranshahrii, commonly known as the Iranian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Euphorbia iranshahrii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
