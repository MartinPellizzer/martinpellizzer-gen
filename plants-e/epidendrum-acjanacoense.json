    "intro": "Epidendrum acjanacoense, commonly known as the Acjanaco orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical studies."
