It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
