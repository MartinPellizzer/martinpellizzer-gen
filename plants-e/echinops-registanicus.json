    "intro": "Echinops registanicus, commonly known as the Afghan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. Echinops registanicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
