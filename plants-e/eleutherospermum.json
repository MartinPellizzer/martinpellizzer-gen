    "intro": "Eleutherospermum, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with alternate, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Eleutherospermum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable environments."
