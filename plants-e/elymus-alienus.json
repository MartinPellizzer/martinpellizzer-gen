    "intro": "Elymus alienus, commonly known as the alien grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are clustered in dense, branching patterns. Elymus alienus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
