    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. riparius, commonly known as river alkali grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaf blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, with the lower spikelets often being sterile. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common species in wetland and riparian habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments."
