    "intro": "Eugenia sarawacensis, commonly known as the Sarawak myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forest growth. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
