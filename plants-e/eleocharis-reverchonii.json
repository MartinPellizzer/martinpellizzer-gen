    "intro": "Eleocharis reverchonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
