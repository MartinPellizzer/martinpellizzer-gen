    "intro": "Epidendrum microdendron, commonly known as the miniature tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, helping it anchor in the soil. Epidendrum microdendron is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
