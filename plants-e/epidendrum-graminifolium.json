    "intro": "Epidendrum graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum graminifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
