    "intro": "Emerus sesban var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sesban, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, seed-bearing pods. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with low soil moisture. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
