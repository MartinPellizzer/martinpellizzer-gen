    "intro": "Euphorbia inaequilatera, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia inaequilatera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
