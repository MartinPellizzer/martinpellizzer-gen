It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, providing it with a distinctive textured appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Ericoides setosum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
