    "intro": "Euphorbia polychroma, commonly known as the rainbow tree, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that can vary in color from green to red and purple. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
