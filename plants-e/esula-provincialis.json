    "intro": "Esula provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial Esula, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Esula provincialis is considered a vulnerable species."
