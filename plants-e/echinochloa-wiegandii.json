It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland health. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration efforts."
