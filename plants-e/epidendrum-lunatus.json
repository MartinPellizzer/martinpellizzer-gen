    "intro": "Epidendrum lunatus, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive, moon-shaped lip. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum lunatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
