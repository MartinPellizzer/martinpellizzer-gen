    "intro": "Eriogonum caninum, commonly known as the dog-toothed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush areas. Eriogonum caninum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
