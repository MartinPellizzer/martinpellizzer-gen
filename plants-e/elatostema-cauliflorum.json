    "intro": "Elatostema cauliflorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they grow directly on the stems rather than the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Elatostema cauliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
