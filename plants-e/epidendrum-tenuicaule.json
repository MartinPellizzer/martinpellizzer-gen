    "intro": "Epidendrum tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tenuicaule is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
