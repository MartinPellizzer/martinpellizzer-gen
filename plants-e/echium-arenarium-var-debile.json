    "intro": "Echium arenarium var. debile, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing, annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its structure is compact, with a prostrate or ascending growth habit, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat. It is a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
