    "intro": "Euphorbia amicorum, commonly known as the friendship euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euphorbia amicorum is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry environments."
