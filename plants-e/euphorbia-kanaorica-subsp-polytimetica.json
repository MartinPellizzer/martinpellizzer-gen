    "intro": "Euphorbia kanaorica subsp. polytimetica, commonly known as the Hawaiian euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it can tolerate high salt exposure and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
