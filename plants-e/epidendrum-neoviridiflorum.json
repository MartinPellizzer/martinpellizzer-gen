    "intro": "Epidendrum neoviridiflorum, commonly known as the Emerald Green Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of bright green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of green and white, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum neoviridiflorum is a popular choice for gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
