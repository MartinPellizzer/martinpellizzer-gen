    "intro": "Eupatorium paludicola, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels and bloom in late summer. Eupatorium paludicola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
