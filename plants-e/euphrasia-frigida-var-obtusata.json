    "intro": "Euphrasia frigida var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved eyebright, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a blunt or rounded tip, and are covered in fine, hairy structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported eye-health benefits."
