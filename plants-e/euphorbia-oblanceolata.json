    "intro": "Euphorbia oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its tissues. Euphorbia oblanceolata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
