It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray spines and a globular or cylindrical growth form. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, appearing in late winter or early spring. Eriosyce senilis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
