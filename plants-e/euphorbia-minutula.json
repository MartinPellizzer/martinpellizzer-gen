    "intro": "Euphorbia minutula, commonly known as the mouse-eared cactus, is a small, succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of tiny, green, spiny stems that resemble mouse ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
