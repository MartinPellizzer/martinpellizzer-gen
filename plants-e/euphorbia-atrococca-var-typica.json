    "intro": "Euphorbia atrococca var. typica, commonly known as the black euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
