It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences and leathery, narrow leaves."
