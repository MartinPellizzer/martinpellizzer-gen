    "intro": "Emerus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly emerus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of grayish-green, velvety leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
