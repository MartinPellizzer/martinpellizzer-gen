    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender leaf cotton grass, is a low-growing plant native to subarctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more slender leaves compared to other varieties of Eriophorum."
