    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stem surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its chemical properties, it is also considered a potential source of pharmaceutical compounds."
