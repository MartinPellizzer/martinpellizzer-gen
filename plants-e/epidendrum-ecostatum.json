    "intro": "Epidendrum ecostatum, commonly known as the Costate Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent yellow lips, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ecostatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
