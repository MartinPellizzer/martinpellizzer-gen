    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia subsp. helleborine, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its complex pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species. The subspecies helleborine is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Epipactis latifolia."
