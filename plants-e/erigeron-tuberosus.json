It features striking spherical blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white to grayish bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a robust root system and produces small, narrow leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.
