    "intro": "Eriocoma webberi, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, adding to its botanical interest. Eriocoma webberi is adapted to cold, harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
