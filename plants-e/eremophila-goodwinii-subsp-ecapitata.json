    "intro": "Eremophila goodwinii subsp. ecapitata, commonly known as the Goodwin's emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
