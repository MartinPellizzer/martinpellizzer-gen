    "intro": "Ehretia saligna var. membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous-leaf ehretia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, somewhat weeping growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are thin and membranous in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
