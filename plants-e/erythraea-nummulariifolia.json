It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
