    "intro": "Euphorbia filiflora var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf filiflora spurge, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
