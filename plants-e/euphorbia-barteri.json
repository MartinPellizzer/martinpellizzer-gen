    "intro": "Euphorbia barteri, commonly known as the Barter's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia barteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
