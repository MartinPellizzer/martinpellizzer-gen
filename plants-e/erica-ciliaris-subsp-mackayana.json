    "intro": "Erica ciliaris subsp. mackayana, commonly known as Mackay's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with wet winters and dry summers. The plant features dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its small, fragrant flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
