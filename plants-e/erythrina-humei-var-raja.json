    "intro": "Erythrina humei var. raja, commonly known as the Crimson Flame Tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in dense, racemose inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three broad, elliptical leaflets, and its woody structure supports its role as a long-lived shrub or small tree. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which disperses after maturation."
