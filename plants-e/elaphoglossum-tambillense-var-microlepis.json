    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tambillense var. microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
