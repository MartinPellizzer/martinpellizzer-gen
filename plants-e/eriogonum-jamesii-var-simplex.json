It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage that is often fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
