    "intro": "Euphorbia holstii var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the desert rose or false rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching into a bushy form. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia holstii var. hebecarpa is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
