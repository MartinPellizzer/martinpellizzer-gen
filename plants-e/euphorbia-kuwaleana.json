    "intro": "Euphorbia kuwaleana, commonly known as the Kuwaleana spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
