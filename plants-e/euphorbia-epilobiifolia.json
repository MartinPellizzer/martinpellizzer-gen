    "intro": "Euphorbia epilobiifolia, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant."
