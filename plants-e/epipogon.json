    "intro": "Epipogon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a fascinating member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. Epipogon species are typically small, with pale or translucent flowers that often resemble the shape of a ghost or a flowerless spike. These plants are epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from their hosts. Their specialized relationship with fungi and their unusual appearance make them rare and ecologically significant in forest ecosystems."
