    "intro": "Elaphoglossum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum albomarginatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
