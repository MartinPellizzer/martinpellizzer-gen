    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Eriogonum microtheca var. alpinum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
