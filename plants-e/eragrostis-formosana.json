It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eragrostis formosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
