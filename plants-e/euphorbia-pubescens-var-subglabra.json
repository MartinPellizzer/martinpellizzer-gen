It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, with a smooth, hairless texture distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
