    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its unbranched, sparsely leafy stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures rather than true leaves. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This variety is notable for its lack of true leaves, which distinguishes it from other equisetum species."
