    "intro": "Effusiella ornata, commonly known as the ornate moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and bright green foliage, which often features intricate patterns and a velvety texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a distinct midrib and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Effusiella ornata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
