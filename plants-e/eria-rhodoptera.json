    "intro": "Eria rhodoptera, commonly known as the red-winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that often feature a mix of red, yellow, and white hues. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The orchid's inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, which can bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions."
