    "intro": "Eriogonum trachygonum subsp. glomerulum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils within desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct morphological and ecological traits compared to other members of the Eriogonum species."
