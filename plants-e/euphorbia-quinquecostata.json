    "intro": "Euphorbia quinquecostata, commonly known as the five-costate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may be spiny, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia quinquecostata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
