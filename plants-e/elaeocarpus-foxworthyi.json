It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a thick, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
