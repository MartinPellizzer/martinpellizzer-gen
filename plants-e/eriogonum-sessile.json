    "intro": "Eriogonum sessile, commonly known as the sessile buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a short stature, often reaching only a few inches in height, and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds. Eriogonum sessile plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
