    "intro": "Epilobium acutum, commonly known as sharpleaf willow herb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces showy pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects. Epilobium acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
