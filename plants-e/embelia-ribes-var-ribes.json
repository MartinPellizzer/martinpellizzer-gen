    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia ribes var. ribes, commonly known as the common embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both traditional medicine and ecological studies."
