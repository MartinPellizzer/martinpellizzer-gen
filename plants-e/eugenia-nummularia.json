    "intro": "Eugenia nummularia, commonly known as the waxleaf eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, woody capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Eugenia nummularia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
