    "intro": "Eugenia harkerae, commonly known as the Harker's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit, which is typically small and yellowish, contains several seeds and is an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia harkerae is considered a rare and endangered species."
