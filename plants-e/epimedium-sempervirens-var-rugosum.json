    "intro": "Epimedium sempervirens var. rugosum, commonly known as the wrinkled barrenwort, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that features wavy, textured leaves with a deep green color. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate moist conditions and its long-lasting foliage throughout the growing season."
