    "intro": "Euphorbia tianshanica, commonly known as the Tianshan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry, rocky soils. Euphorbia tianshanica is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in harsh, desert-like conditions."
