    "intro": "Eugenia grata var. nervosa, commonly known as the pink-leafed guava, is a variant of the guava species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or red foliage, which contrasts with its small, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less flavorful compared to the standard guava. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This ornamental variant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
