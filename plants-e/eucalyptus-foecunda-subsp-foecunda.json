    "intro": "Eucalyptus foecunda subsp. foecunda, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with greyish bark that peels in strips, revealing a reddish inner layer. The leaves are narrow, linear to lanceolate, and often have a slight blue or greyish bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in open woodlands and on sandy soils."
