    "intro": "Eulophia toyoshimae, commonly known as the Toyoshima eulophia, is a rare orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sensitive species in botanical studies."
