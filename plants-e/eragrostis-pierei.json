    "intro": "Eragrostis pierei, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Eragrostis pierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
