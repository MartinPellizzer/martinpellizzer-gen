    "intro": "Elatostema eriocephalum, commonly known as the velvetleaf false shamrock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Elatostema eriocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
