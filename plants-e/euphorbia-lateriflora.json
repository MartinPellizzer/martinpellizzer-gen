    "intro": "Euphorbia lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in short, woolly hairs and produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often found in rocky areas and along coastal regions. Euphorbia lateriflora is known for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique appearance."
