    "intro": "Elaphoglossum coursii, commonly known as the Cours' holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups. Elaphoglossum coursii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
