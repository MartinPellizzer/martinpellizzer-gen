    "intro": "Electra calycina, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem with a single inflorescence at the top. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive cup-shaped flower cluster, which is characteristic of the genus Electra. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
