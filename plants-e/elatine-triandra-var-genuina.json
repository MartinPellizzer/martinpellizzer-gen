    "intro": "Elatine triandra var. genuina, commonly known as the slender waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has whorled leaves that are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Elatine triandra var. genuina is often found in moist soil or floating on the water surface, and it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
