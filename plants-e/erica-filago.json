    "intro": "Erica filago, commonly known as the coastal heath or sand heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. Erica filago is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes other heath and heather plants. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
