    "intro": "Erinacea anthyllis, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy, glandular stems that often produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Erinacea anthyllis thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
