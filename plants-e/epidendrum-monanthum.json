It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum monanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
