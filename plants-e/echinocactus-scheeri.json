    "intro": "Echinocactus scheeri, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces a fruit that is a hairy, red to yellow capsule. Echinocactus scheeri is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stem."
