    "intro": "Encyclia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. Encyclia pilosa thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
