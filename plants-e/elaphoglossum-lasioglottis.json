    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lasioglottis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum lasioglottis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
