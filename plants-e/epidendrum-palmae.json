    "intro": "Epidendrum palmae, commonly known as the palm-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that resemble palm fronds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and come in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a fragrant aroma. Epidendrum palmae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
