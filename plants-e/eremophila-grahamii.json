    "intro": "Eremophila grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardens. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
