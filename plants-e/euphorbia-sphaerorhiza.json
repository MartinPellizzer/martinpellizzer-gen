    "intro": "Euphorbia sphaerorhiza, commonly known as the globe spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Euphorbia sphaerorhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
