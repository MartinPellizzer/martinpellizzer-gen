It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it resilient in harsh desert conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
