    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora subsp. kuenkeleana, commonly known as the Kuenkele\u2019s green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
