    "intro": "Elsholtzia glabra, commonly known as the smooth elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features slender, upright stems covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white pubescence. Elsholtzia glabra is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
