    "intro": "Echinocactus aciculatus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a thick, spiny stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Echinocactus aciculatus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
