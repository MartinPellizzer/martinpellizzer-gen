    "intro": "Ervatamia pallida, commonly known as the pale ervatamia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ervatamia pallida is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
