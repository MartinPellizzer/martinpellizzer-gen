    "intro": "Epidendrum nasutum, commonly known as the long-beaked orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining potting media. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or mounted displays. Epidendrum nasutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
