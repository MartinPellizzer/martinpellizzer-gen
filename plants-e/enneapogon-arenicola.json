    "intro": "Enneapogon arenicola, commonly known as the sandblown grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to sandy and coastal environments. It has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh, windy conditions. Its roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in dune ecosystems. Enneapogon arenicola is well-suited to arid and saline conditions, thriving in environments with limited water availability."
