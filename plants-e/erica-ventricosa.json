    "intro": "Erica ventricosa, commonly known as the cushion heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with many small, leathery leaves arranged in tight clusters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Erica ventricosa is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
