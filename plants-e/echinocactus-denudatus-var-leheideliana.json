    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus var. leheideliana, commonly known as the Leheidelia cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a spiny, ribbed structure that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
