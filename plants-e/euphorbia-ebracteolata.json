    "intro": "Euphorbia ebracteolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
