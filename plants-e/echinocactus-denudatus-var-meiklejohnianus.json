    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus var. meiklejohnianus, commonly known as the Meiklejohn's hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, white spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
