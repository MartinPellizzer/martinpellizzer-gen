    "intro": "Epidendrum nervosum, commonly known as the nervy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom in racemes during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum nervosum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
