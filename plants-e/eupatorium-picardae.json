    "intro": "Eupatorium picardae, commonly known as Picard's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs in the late summer to early fall. Eupatorium picardae is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
