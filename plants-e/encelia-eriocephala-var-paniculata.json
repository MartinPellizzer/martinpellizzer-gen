    "intro": "Encelia eriocephala var. paniculata, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, gray-green foliage and produces showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its flowering heads are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
