It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to habitat destruction, Eria palawanensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
