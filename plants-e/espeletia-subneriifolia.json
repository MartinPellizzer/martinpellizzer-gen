    "intro": "Espeletia subneriifolia, commonly known as the Colombian pineapple plant, is a rosette-forming shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the center of its rosette, which is typically yellow or orange in color. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
