    "intro": "Enkleia, commonly known as the \"blue mist shrub,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Enkleia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
