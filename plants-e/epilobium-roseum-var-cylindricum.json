It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and roadside habitats. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It produces showy pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
