    "intro": "Eucalyptus goniantha subsp. semiglobosa, commonly known as the globular eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually dull green and often covered with a whitish bloom. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its aromatic oils make it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
