    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. futakii, commonly known as the Japanese harebell, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown capsules as its fruit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
