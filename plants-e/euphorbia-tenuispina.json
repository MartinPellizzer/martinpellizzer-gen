    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often reduced to spines, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Euphorbia tenuispina is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance."
