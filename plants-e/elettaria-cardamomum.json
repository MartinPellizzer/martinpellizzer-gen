    "intro": "Elettaria cardamomum, commonly known as cardamom, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is valued for its aromatic seeds, which are used as a spice and in traditional medicine. The plant produces compact, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its underground rhizomes contribute to its growth. Cardamom thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often cultivated in mountainous regions. The essential oils extracted from its seeds contain compounds like cineole and limonene, which are responsible for its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties."
