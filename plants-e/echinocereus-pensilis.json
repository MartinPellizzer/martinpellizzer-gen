    "intro": "Echinocereus pensilis, commonly known as the pendant hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Echinocereus pensilis is also known for its ability to produce edible fruits, which are typically small and tangy."
