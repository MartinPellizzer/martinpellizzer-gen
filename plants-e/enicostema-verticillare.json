    "intro": "Enicostema verticillare, commonly known as the whorled panic grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Enicostema verticillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden settings."
