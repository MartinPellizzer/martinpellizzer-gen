    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. cziticus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with leathery, awned glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
