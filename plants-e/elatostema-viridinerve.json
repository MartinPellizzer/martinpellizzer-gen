It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent green veins that give it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Elatostema viridinerve is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps it thrive in competitive understory conditions."
