    "intro": "Empetrum crassifolium, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments makes it an important component of tundra and rocky habitats. Empetrum crassifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
