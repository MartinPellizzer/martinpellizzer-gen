    "intro": "Euthemis leucocarpa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf white apple tree, is a variant of the white apple tree native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, apple-like fruits that are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
