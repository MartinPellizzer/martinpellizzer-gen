    "intro": "Eupatorium oxychlaenum, commonly known as the slender boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
