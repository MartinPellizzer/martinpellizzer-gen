    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longicrure, commonly known as the long-legged holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Elaphoglossum longicrure is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
