    "intro": "Euphorbia neogracilis, commonly known as the glass plant or milkweed plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, contributing to its unique aesthetic. Euphorbia neogracilis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions."
