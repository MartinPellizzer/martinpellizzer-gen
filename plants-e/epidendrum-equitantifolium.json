    "intro": "Epidendrum equitantifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
