    "intro": "Epipactis colorata, commonly known as the showy yellow orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flower spike bears several showy, spurred orchid flowers. Epipactis colorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
