    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. proliferum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum \u00d7 proliferum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring whorled leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the stems. This variant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats."
