    "intro": "Eriogonum foliosum var. hastatum, commonly known as the hairyleaf buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
