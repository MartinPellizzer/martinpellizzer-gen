It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green with a powdery coating, known as farina. The leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It produces vibrant pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in well-draining soil."
