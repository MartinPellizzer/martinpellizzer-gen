    "intro": "Encephalartos transvenosus, commonly known as the Transvenosus cycad, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
