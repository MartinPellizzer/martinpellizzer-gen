    "intro": "Euphorbia boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cylindrical inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia boivinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and resilience."
