    "intro": "Eremia calycina, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Eremia calycina has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments, and it plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
