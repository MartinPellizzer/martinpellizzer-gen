    "intro": "Erica extrusa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica extrusa is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
