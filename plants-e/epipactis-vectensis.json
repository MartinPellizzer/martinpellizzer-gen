    "intro": "Epipactis vectensis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that typically range from yellow to greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, often growing in association with other orchid species. It produces a single, elongated spike of flowers, which are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The species is known for its ability to hybridize with other epipactis species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
