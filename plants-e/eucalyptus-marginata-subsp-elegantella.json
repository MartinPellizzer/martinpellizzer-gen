    "intro": "Eucalyptus marginata subsp. elegantella, commonly known as the elegant mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly curved, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
