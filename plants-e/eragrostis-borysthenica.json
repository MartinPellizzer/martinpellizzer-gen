It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, open panicle, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eragrostis borysthenica is adapted to withstand drought and is considered an important component of its native ecosystems."
