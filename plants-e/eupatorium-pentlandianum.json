    "intro": "Eupatorium pentlandianum, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
