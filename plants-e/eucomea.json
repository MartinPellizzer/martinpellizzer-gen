    "intro": "Eucomea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and includes several species that are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plants typically have rough, bark-like stems and are often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucomea species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in tool-making and construction. However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
