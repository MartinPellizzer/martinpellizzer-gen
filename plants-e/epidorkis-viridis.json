    "intro": "Epidorkis viridis, commonly known as the green mossy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, greenish coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Epidorkis viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
