    "intro": "Euphorbia phosphorea, commonly known as the phosphorescent spurge, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, greenish-gray stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions, a trait that is rare among succulents. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments. This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and nocturnal glow."
