    "intro": "Echeveria peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian rose, is a succulent native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adorned with fine white hairs. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Echeveria peruviana is popular among collectors for its striking appearance and ease of care."
