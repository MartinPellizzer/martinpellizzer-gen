    "intro": "Euphorbia boerhaavioides, commonly known as the Boerhaave's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
