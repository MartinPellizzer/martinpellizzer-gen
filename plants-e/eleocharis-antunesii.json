    "intro": "Eleocharis antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing microhabitats for aquatic organisms."
