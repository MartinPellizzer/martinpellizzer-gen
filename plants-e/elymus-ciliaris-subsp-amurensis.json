It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and fine, needle-shaped leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
