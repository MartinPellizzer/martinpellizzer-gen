    "intro": "Emmotum ptarianum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
