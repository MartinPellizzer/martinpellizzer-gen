    "intro": "Eremophila gilesii var. filiforme, commonly known as the slender emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It is well-suited to low-water environments and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
