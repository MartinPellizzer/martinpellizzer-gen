    "intro": "Erodium trifolium var. montanum, commonly known as mountain bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
