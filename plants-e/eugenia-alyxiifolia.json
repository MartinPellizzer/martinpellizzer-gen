    "intro": "Eugenia alyxiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
