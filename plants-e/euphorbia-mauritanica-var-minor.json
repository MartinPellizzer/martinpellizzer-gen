    "intro": "Euphorbia mauritanica var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features a compact growth habit with dense, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
