It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, red spines. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
