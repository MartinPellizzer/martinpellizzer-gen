    "intro": "Erythraea curvistaninea, commonly known as the red-stemmed erythraea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy, reddish stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slight waxy coating, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements and limited availability in horticultural trade."
