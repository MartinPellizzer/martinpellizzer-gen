    "intro": "Euphorbia biharamulensis, commonly known as the Biharamul euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces a unique, spiky flower cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
