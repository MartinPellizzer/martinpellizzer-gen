    "intro": "Euphorbia cymbiformis, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
