    "intro": "Elymus mutabilis var. oschensis, commonly known as the Oschensky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray florets that bloom in late summer. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns or ground covers in suitable climates."
