    "intro": "Elymus sitanion, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Elymus sitanion is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
