    "intro": "Echinochloa nervosa, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and along roadsides. Echinochloa nervosa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
