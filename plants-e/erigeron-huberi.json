    "intro": "Erigeron huberi, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron huberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
