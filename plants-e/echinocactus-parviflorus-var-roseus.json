    "intro": "Echinocactus parviflorus var. roseus, commonly known as the roseate hedgehog cactus, is a slow-growing, columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense, spiny stem covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
