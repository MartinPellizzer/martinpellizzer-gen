    "intro": "Empogona welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest surviving plant species, with fossil records dating back over 100 million years. The plant has a distinctive structure with two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It also possesses a woody stem that can reach several meters in height, often with a thick, corky bark. Its survival in extreme desert conditions is due to its specialized adaptations, including deep root systems and the ability to store water efficiently."
