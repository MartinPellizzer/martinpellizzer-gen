    "intro": "Earlia excelsa, commonly known as the noble earlia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and partial shade. Earlia excelsa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
