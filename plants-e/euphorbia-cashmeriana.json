    "intro": "Euphorbia cashmeriana, commonly known as the Kashmir spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
