    "intro": "Elymus angustiformis, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Elymus angustiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
