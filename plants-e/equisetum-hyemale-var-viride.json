    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. viride, commonly known as the green horse fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetinales. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety differs from the typical Equisetum hyemale by its more vibrant green coloration and slightly different leaf structure. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
