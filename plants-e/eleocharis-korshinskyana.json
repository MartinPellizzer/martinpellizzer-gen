    "intro": "Eleocharis korshinskyana, commonly known as the Korshinsky's spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis korshinskyana is also valued for its ornamental potential in aquatic gardens."
