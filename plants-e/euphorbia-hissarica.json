    "intro": "Euphorbia hissarica, commonly known as the Hissar spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It features succulent, spine-tipped leaves and produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
