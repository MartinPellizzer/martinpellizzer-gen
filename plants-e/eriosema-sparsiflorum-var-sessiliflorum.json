It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and prominent stamens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for horticultural purposes."
