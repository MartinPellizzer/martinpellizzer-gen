    "intro": "Eurycaulis cerinus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that help in trapping prey. The plant possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to capture and digest insects. It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments, often found in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through predation."
