    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blepharis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum blepharis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and shade gardens."
