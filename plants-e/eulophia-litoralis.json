    "intro": "Eulophia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and tidal zones, adapting to salty and humid environments. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs and is often found in mangrove or brackish water habitats. Eulophia litoralis plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
