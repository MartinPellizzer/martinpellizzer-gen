    "intro": "Exostema wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's exostema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is typically found in rocky crevices and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
