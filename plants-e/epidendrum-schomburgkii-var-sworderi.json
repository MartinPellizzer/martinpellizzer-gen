    "intro": "Epidendrum schomburgkii var. sworderi, commonly known as the Sworderi Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long, sword-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
