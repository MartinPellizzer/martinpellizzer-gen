    "intro": "Euphorbia atoto var. imbricata, commonly known as the Atoto spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
