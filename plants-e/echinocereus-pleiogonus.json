    "intro": "Echinocereus pleiogonus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a solitary plant with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant, spiny flowers that range in color from yellow to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
