    "intro": "Eragrostis lasioclada, commonly known as roughhair panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Eragrostis lasioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
