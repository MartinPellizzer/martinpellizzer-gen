    "intro": "Euphorbia pillansii var. ramosissima, commonly known as the skeleton bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems that are covered in a waxy, pale-green cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
