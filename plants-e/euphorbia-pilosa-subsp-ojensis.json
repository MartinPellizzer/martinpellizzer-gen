    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa subsp. ojensis, commonly known as the Ojenson's milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, with a unique structure known as a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and other low-maintenance gardening applications."
