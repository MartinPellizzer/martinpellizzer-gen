    "intro": "Epicampes minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Epicampes minutiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
