    "intro": "Ericoides cumuliflorum, commonly known as the cloudflower, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in high-altitude, alpine environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted to attract pollinators in its cold, windy habitat. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, helping to conserve moisture in the harsh conditions. Ericoides cumuliflorum is often found in rocky soils and is an indicator species of undisturbed mountain ecosystems."
