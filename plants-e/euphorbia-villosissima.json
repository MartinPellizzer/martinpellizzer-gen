    "intro": "Euphorbia villosissima, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
