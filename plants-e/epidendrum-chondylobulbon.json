It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with green sepals and petals, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface to reduce water loss.
