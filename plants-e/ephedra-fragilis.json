It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Ephedra fragilis is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall."
