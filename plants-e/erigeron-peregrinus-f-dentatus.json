    "intro": "Erigeron peregrinus f. dentatus, commonly known as the toothed blueweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, toothed leaves and small, blue to purple composite flowers. Native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States, this plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It blooms during the summer months, producing numerous small flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
