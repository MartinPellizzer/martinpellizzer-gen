    "intro": "Echinocactus sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to dry environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
