It features narrow, bright yellow to golden-green leaves that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or brown. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Erianthus aureus is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
