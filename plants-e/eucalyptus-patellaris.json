    "intro": "Eucalyptus patellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and often exhibits a multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Eucalyptus patellaris is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
