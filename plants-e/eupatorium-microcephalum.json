    "intro": "Eupatorium microcephalum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall. It serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
