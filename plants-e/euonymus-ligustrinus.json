    "intro": "Euonymus ligustrinus, commonly known as the evergreen boxwood, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often used in horticulture for topiary and ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to maintain shape. Euonymus ligustrinus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
