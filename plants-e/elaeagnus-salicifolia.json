    "intro": "Elaeagnus salicifolia, commonly known as silverthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and small, edible fruits that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Elaeagnus salicifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil restoration efforts."
