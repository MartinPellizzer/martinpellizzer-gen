    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. virgatum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila at the tips of its stems, which are cylindrical and often referred to as \"spore cones.\" It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. This variety is distinguished by its more slender and less robust stems compared to the typical form of Equisetum fluviatile."
