    "intro": "Eucalyptus stoatei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in long strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus stoatei is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, make it a valuable plant for medicinal and aromatic uses."
