    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus subsp. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered nightblooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
