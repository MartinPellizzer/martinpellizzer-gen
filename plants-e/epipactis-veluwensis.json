    "intro": "Epipactis veluwensis, commonly known as the Veluwense helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the Netherlands. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wet meadows. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
