It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow tones on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
