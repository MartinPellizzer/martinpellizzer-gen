    "intro": "Euonymus pterocladus, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange berries that are edible for birds. Euonymus pterocladus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for garden landscapes."
