    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus, commonly known as the Hamilton's spurge or the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, four-petaled yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
