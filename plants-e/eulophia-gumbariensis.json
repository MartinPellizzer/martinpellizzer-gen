It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Eulophia gumbariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively rare in cultivation."
