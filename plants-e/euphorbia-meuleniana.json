    "intro": "Euphorbia meuleniana, commonly known as the Meulen\u2019s spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clustered, fleshy leaves that are often green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia meuleniana is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in dry conditions."
