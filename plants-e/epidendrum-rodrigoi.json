    "intro": "Epidendrum rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodriguez's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of vibrant, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapted for efficient water retention. Epidendrum rodrigoi is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
