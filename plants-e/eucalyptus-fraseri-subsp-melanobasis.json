    "intro": "Eucalyptus fraseri subsp. melanobasis, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a prominent midrib, with a glossy upper surface and a pale, sometimes hairy underside. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
