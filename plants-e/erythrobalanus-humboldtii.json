    "intro": "Erythrobalanus humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's erythrobalanus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erythrobalanus humboldtii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
