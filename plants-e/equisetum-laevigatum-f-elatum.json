    "intro": "Equisetum laevigatum f. elatum, commonly known as the tall slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for propagation. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient appearance and primitive structure make it a living fossil, offering insights into early plant evolution."
