    "intro": "Eucalyptus terminalis var. longipedata, commonly known as the long-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in thin, ribbon-like strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive blue-green color with a whitish underside. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or cream, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits. This species is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodlands and along watercourses."
