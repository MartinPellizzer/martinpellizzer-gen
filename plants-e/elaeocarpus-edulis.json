    "intro": "Elaeocarpus edulis, commonly known as the \"breadfruit tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces large, green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow when ripe, containing a starchy, edible pulp surrounding a central core. The fruit is a valuable food source, rich in carbohydrates and nutrients, and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
