    "intro": "Epidendrum subpurum, commonly known as the Purple Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking purple and green foliage, which often features a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum subpurum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
