    "intro": "Eupatorium choricephalum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eupatorium choricephalum is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ornamental appeal."
