    "intro": "Echeveria edulis var. attenuata, commonly known as the attenuated jade plant, is a succulent species native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
