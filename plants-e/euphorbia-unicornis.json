    "intro": "Euphorbia unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn's horn, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive single, spiny stem that resembles a horn, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the primary attraction. Its leaves are fleshy and triangular, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia unicornis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
