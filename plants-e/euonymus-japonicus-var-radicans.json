It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The varietal form 'radicans' is distinguished by its spreading, creeping growth habit."
