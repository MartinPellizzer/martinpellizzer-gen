    "intro": "Epidendrum platypleuromegaloclinium, commonly known as the giant pleuroclinium orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, providing a lush, green backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant in tropical climates."
