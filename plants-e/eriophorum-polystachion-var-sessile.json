    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. sessile, commonly known as the sessile cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundras and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and often form a dense mat near the ground. The species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
