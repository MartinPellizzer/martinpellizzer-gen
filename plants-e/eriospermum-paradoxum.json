    "intro": "Eriospermum paradoxum, commonly known as the strange eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a short, woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, and it produces small, hard seeds enclosed in a pithy capsule. Eriospermum paradoxum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
