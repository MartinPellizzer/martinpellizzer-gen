    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp. neocapillus, commonly known as the green-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
