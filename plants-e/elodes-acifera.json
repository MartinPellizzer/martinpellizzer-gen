It has long, slender, branching stems that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, green, oval leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. Its flowers are tiny, yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, typically emerging above the water surface. Elodes acifera plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
