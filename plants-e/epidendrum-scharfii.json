    "intro": "Epidendrum scharfii, commonly known as the Scharff's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant with a sympodial growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Epidendrum scharfii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
