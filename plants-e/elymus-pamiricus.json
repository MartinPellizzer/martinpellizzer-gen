    "intro": "Elymus pamiricus, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. The plant has tufted growth habits and produces spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it ecologically significant. Elymus pamiricus is also valued for its potential in forage and erosion control in marginal lands."
