It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, leafless stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
