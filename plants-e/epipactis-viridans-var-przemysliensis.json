    "intro": "Epipactis viridans var. przemysliensis, commonly known as the Przemysl green helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions in Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a humid, cool environment for optimal growth. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
