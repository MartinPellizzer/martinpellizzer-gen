It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
