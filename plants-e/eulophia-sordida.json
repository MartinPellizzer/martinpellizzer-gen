    "intro": "Eulophia sordida, commonly known as the dirty orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Eulophia sordida is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid climates with proper drainage."
