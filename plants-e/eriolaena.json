    "intro": "Eriolaena, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its deciduous nature and distinctive, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Eriolaena species are often found in sandy or well-drained soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
