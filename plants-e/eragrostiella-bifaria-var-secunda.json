It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
