    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. genuinum, commonly known as common stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 cm tall, with trifoliate leaves and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers."
