    "intro": "Eriochloa annulata, commonly known as the ringed grass or annulate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Eriochloa annulata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways where it thrives in moist, sandy or clayey soils."
