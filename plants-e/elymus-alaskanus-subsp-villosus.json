    "intro": "Elymus alaskanus subsp. villosus, commonly known as Alaska hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. This subspecies thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and tundra environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
