    "intro": "Eriophyllum trolliifolium, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eriophyllum trolliifolium is known for its showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
