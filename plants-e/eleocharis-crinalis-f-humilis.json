    "intro": "Eleocharis crinalis f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually less than 10 cm in height, contributing to its compact appearance. The flowers are usually pale green to brown, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
