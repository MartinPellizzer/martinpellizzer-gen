    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 moorei nothosubsp. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese horse-tail, is a hybrid fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like stems. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique combination of primitive and modern features, including a stem that elongates through apical meristems and a lack of true leaves. Its spores are released from the terminal cones, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
