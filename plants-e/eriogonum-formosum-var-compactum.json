    "intro": "Eriogonum formosum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, compact growth with small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a desirable plant for native landscaping and conservation efforts."
