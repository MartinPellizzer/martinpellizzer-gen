    "intro": "Elaphoglossum webbii, commonly known as the Webbi's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided, feather-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum webbii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
