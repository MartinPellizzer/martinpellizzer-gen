    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii subsp. typicum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
