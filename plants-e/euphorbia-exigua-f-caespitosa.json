    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua f. caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
