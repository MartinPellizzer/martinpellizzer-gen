    "intro": "Eranthis byunsanensis, commonly known as the Korean early violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Korea. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
