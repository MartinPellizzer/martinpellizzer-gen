    "intro": "Eremophila psilocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. Eremophila psilocalyx is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
