    "intro": "Euphorbia lecheoides var. exumensis, commonly known as the Exuma euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a fuzzy texture. This species is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky soils or in sandy areas."
