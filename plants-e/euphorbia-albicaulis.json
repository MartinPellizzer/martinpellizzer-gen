    "intro": "Euphorbia albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and stems that often have a milky sap. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in desert regions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
