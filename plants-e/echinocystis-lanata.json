    "intro": "Echinocystis lanata, commonly known as the hairy gourd, is a vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ridged stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to large, spiky, green fruits. The fruit's exterior is covered in small, stiff spines, which provide protection against herbivores. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash."
