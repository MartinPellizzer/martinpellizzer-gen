    "intro": "Euphrasia lanceolata proles olotensis, commonly known as the Olot endemic eyebright, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is a herbaceous species characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
