    "intro": "Eugenia lineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Eugenia lineata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
