    "intro": "Epilobium trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Epilobium trichophyllum is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
