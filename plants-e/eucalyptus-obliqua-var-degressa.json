    "intro": "Eucalyptus obliqua var. degressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a variant of the broad-leaf stringybark. It is a tall, slender tree with a straight trunk and a narrow, often sparsely foliaged crown. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a greyish-green upper surface and a pale underside. The bark is fibrous and flaky, peeling off in long strips to reveal a smooth, pale greenish-brown surface. It is native to southeastern Australia and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils."
