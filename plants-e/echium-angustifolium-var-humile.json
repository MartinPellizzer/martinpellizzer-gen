    "intro": "Echium angustifolium var. humile, commonly known as narrowleaf evening primrose, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
