    "intro": "Echinops nitens, commonly known as the slender globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Echinops nitens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
