    "intro": "Erica caffra var. caffra, commonly known as the Cape heath or coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink or red flowers in spring and summer. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Erica caffra var. caffra is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
