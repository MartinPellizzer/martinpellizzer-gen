It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It produces showy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
