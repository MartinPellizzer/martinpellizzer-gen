    "intro": "Erythronium aquatile, commonly known as the water dog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive red or orange throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
