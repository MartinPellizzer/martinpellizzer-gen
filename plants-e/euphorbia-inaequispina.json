    "intro": "Euphorbia inaequispina, commonly known as the unequal-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
