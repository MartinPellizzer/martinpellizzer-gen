    "intro": "Euzomum acre, commonly known as the narrow-leaved euzomum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
