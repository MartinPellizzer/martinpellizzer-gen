    "intro": "Ezoloba macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited forest tree, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces large, woody fruits that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in green or reddish hues, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important component of the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
