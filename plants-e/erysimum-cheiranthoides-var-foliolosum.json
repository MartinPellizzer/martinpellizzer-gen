It features basal rosettes of pinnately lobed, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
