    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a variant of the common spurge, characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. This variant is often confused with other Euphorbia species due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
