    "intro": "Eugenia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous and have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, typically arranged in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits to release small, dark seeds. Eugenia leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
