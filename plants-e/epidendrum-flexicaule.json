    "intro": "Epidendrum flexicaule, commonly known as the flexible epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a waxy surface, which helps in water retention. Epidendrum flexicaule is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
