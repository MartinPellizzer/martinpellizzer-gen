    "intro": "Epiandria, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers are typically showy with a complex structure. Epiandria species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in horticulture."
