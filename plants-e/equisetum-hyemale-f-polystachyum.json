    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. polystachyum, commonly known as the tall scouring rush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the top of the stems, which are often clustered in a distinctive, cone-like shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. This ancient plant is considered a living fossil, having existed since the Paleozoic era."
