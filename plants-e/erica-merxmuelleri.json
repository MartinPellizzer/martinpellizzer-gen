    "intro": "Erica merxmuelleri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark green foliage. Erica merxmuelleri is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
