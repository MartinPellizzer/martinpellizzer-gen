    "intro": "Eragrostis gangetica, commonly known as Indian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis gangetica is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
