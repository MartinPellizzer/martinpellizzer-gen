    "intro": "Eriocaulon siamense var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat. The species is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
