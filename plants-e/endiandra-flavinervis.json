    "intro": "Endiandra flavinervis, commonly known as the yellow-veined endiandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with prominent yellow veins. The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
