    "intro": "Eryngium hedgeanum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some areas. Eryngium hedgeanum is known for its resilience and ability to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds."
