    "intro": "Epidendrum domingense, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Epidendrum domingense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
