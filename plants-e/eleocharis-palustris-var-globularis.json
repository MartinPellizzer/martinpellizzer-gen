    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. globularis, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by spikelets that disperse seeds via water or wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
