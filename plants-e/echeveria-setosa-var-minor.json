    "intro": "Echeveria setosa var. minor, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
