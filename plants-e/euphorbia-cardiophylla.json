    "intro": "Euphorbia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia cardiophylla is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
