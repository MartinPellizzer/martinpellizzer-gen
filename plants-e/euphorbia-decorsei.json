    "intro": "Euphorbia decorsei, commonly known as the Decorsei's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by brightly colored bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
