    "intro": "Elaphoglossum burchellii var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Elaphoglossum. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This variant is native to parts of South America and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds."
