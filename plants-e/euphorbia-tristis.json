    "intro": "Euphorbia tristis, commonly known as the weeping spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, drooping inflorescences that resemble small, green lanterns. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which are often the main attraction. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care due to its milky sap."
