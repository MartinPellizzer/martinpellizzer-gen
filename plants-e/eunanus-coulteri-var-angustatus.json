    "intro": "Eunanus coulteri var. angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf eunanus, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and horticultural studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
