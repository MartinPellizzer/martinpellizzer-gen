    "intro": "Eugenia conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens and horticultural collections."
