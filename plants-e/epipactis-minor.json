    "intro": "Epipactis minor, commonly known as the lesser epipactis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Epipactis minor is known for its subtle fragrance and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
