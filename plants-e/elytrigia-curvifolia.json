    "intro": "Elytrigia curvifolia, commonly known as bentgrass or curlyleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often curling leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia curvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its fine texture and resilience."
