    "intro": "Erythroxylum trinerve, commonly known as the red veined or crimson veined plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its strikingly veined leaves that display a deep red coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its unique leaf patterns make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. However, it is important to note that some species within the Erythroxylum genus are related to coca and have legal restrictions in certain regions."
