    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa subsp. damiensiana, commonly known as Damien's hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions as a low-maintenance ground cover."
