    "intro": "Euphorbia aequoris, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky, toxic latex when damaged, which is a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Euphorbia aequoris thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt spray zones near the shoreline."
