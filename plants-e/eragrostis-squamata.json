    "intro": "Eragrostis squamata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
