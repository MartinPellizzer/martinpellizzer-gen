    "intro": "Eucalyptus costuligera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and white or pale blue, often clustered in groups of three. The leaves and branches are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and have also been studied for their potential aromatic and medicinal properties."
