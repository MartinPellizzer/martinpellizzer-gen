    "intro": "Espeletia marcescens, commonly known as the \"Cock's Comb\" or \"P\u00e1ramo Flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its rosette growth form and striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a comb. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Espeletia marcescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the p\u00e1ramo."
