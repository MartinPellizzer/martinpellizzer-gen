    "intro": "Euphorbia effusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia effusa is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
