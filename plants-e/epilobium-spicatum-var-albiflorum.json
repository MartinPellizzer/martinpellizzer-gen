    "intro": "Epilobium spicatum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
