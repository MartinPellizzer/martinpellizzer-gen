    "intro": "Ecbolium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Ecbolium species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. These plants are generally herbaceous, with some species growing as annuals or perennials."
