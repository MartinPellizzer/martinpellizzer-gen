    "intro": "Eriosema macrostipulum var. suborbiculare, commonly known as the broad-leaf eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and a dense covering of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with showy, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
