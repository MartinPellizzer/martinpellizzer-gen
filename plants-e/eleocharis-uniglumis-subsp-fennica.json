    "intro": "Eleocharis uniglumis subsp. fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in bogs or marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold, northern climates. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
