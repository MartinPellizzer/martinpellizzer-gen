    "intro": "Endiandra sulavesiana, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Endiandra sulavesiana is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
