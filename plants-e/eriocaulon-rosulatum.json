    "intro": "Eriocaulon rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette flat sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Eriocaulon rosulatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
