    "intro": "Eriosorus myriophyllus, commonly known as the giant cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded forest environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. Eriosorus myriophyllus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for small organisms."
