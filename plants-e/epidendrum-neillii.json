    "intro": "Epidendrum neillii, commonly known as the Neill's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Epidendrum neillii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
