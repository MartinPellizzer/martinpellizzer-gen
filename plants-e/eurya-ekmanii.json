    "intro": "Eurya ekmanii, commonly known as the Kauai eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it bears small, leathery leaves. Eurya ekmanii is a shrub that can grow up to several feet tall, with a compact and dense growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
