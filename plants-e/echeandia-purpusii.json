    "intro": "Echeandia purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's echeandia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
