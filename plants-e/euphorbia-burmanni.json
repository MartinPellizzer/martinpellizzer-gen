    "intro": "Euphorbia burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause irritation upon contact. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
