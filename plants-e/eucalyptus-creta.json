    "intro": "Eucalyptus creta, commonly known as the white box eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often grey-green in color, with a leathery texture. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
