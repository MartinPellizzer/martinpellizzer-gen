    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus var. carnosus, commonly known as the fat hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in spines and a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. This variety is particularly noted for its fleshy, succulent appearance, which gives it its common name."
