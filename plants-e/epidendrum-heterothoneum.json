    "intro": "Epidendrum heterothoneum, commonly known as the variable epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum heterothoneum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
