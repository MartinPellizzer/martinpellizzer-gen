    "intro": "Eucalyptus ordiana, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The flowers are typically white or pink and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The wood of Eucalyptus ordiana is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
