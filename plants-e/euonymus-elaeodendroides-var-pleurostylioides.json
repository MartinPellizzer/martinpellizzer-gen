    "intro": "Euonymus elaeodendroides var. pleurostylioides, commonly known as the pleurostylioid euonymus, is a variant of the euonymus genus native to China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. This variant is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
