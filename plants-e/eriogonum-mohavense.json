    "intro": "Eriogonum mohavense, commonly known as Mohave buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as the Mojave Desert. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Eriogonum mohavense plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various desert wildlife."
