    "intro": "Eupatorium pycnocephalum f. glandulitectum, commonly known as the glandular-headed eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, glandular-structured inflorescences. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its small, white to pale purple flowers are arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The glandular structures on its stems and leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions."
