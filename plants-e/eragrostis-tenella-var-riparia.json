It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and lakeshores, thriving in environments with regular water availability. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers.
