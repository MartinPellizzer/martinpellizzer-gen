    "intro": "Epipogium tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Europe. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy tuber that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, hooded structure and showy labellum. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a protected species in several countries."
