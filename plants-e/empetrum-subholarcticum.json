    "intro": "Empetrum subholarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a dwarf shrub native to the subarctic and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, greenish-white blooms that are pollinated by wind. The berries it produces are red and fleshy, providing a food source for birds and small mammals in its ecosystem."
