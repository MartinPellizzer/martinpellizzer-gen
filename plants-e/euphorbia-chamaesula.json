    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesula, commonly known as the snowplant, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia chamaesula is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
