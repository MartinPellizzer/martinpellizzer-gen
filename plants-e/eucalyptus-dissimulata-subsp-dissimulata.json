It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small and usually pale or white, arranged in clusters, and the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
