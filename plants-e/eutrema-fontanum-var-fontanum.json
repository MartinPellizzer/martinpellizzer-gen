    "intro": "Eutrema fontanum var. fontanum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitat. Eutrema fontanum var. fontanum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
