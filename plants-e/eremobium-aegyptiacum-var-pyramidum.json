    "intro": "Eremobium aegyptiacum var. pyramidum, commonly known as the Egyptian sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a characteristic species of desert environments."
