    "intro": "Ephedra holoptera, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Ephedra holoptera contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
