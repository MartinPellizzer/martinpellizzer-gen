    "intro": "Eupatorium steviifolium, commonly known as giant thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its size and habitat preferences, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance."
