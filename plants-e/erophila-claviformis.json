    "intro": "Erophila claviformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Erophila claviformis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
