    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 megapolitana, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often spine-tipped. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it a hardy ornamental plant in many regions."
