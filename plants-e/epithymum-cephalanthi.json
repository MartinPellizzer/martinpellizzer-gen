    "intro": "Epithymum cephalanthi, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Epithymum cephalanthi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions."
