    "intro": "Ecbolium nodosum, commonly known as the nodding ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that often have a distinctive yellow or orange hue. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Ecbolium nodosum is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to drought conditions through its deep root system."
