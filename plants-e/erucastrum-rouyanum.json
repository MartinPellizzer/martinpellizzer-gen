It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
