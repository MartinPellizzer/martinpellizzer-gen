    "intro": "Echinocereus aggregatus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinocereus aggregatus is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
