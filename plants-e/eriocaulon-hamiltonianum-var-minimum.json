It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a rosette-like structure. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. It is characterized by its compact size and is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal."
