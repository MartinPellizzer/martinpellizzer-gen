    "intro": "Epidendrum yatapuense, commonly known as the Yatapu orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
