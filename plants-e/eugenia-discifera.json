    "intro": "Eugenia discifera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, red or orange fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
