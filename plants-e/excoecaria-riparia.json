    "intro": "Excoecaria riparia, commonly known as the river croton, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery substance, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found near waterways. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
