    "intro": "Echinocereus decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that are typically covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
