    "intro": "Euphorbia syspirensis, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a striking succulent native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain water in its arid habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its stems can grow up to several meters in length, making it a dramatic addition to any collection. Euphorbia syspirensis is known for its ability to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care."
