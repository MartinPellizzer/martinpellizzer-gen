    "intro": "Euphorbia maysillesii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive branching structure with multiple stems that resemble a candlestick, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Euphorbia maysillesii is known for its resilience to drought and heat, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
