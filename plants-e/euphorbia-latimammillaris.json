    "intro": "Euphorbia latimammillaris, commonly known as the broad-nosed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous cylindrical, ribbed leaves that are green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a crown of modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves. Euphorbia latimammillaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
