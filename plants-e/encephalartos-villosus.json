    "intro": "Encephalartos villosus, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones typically growing at the base of the plant and the female cones at the top. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
