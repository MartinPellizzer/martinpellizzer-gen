    "intro": "Eragrostis collina, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important stabilizer of coastal dunes. Eragrostis collina plays a vital role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife in its habitat."
