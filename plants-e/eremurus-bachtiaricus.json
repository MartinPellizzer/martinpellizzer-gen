    "intro": "Eremurus bachtiaricus, commonly known as the Afghan giant candleplant, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that can reach heights of up to 5 meters, topped with a dense cluster of large, spiky yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the genus Eremurus, which is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Eremurus bachtiaricus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic appearance and unique floral display."
