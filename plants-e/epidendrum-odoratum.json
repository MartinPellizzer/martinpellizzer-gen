    "intro": "Epidendrum odoratum, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Epidendrum odoratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home environment."
