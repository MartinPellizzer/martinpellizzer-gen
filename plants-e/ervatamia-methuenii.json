    "intro": "Ervatamia methuenii, commonly known as the Methuen's ervatamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
