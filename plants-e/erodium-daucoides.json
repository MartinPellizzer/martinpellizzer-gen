    "intro": "Erodium daucoides, commonly known as the common erodium, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two parts upon maturity. Erodium daucoides is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
