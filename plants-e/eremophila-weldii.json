    "intro": "Eremophila weldii, commonly known as the Grey Leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Eremophila weldii is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
