    "intro": "Elymus dentatus var. elatus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
