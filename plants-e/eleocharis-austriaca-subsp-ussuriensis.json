    "intro": "Eleocharis austriaca subsp. ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northeastern Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its potential for restoration projects."
