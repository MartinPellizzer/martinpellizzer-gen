    "intro": "Ectasis stellaris, commonly known as the starlight lily, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom only during the twilight hours. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Ectasis stellaris is considered a conservation priority."
