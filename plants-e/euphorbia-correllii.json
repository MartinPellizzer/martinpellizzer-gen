    "intro": "Euphorbia correllii, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia correllii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
