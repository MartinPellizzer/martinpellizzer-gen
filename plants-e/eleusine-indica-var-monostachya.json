It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers followed by spikelets that contain small, oval seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
