It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
