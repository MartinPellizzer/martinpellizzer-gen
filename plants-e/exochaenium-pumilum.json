    "intro": "Exochaenium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
