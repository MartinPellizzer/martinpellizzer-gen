    "intro": "Embryopteris glutinifolia, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a distinctive, glabrous, and often sticky surface on its fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
