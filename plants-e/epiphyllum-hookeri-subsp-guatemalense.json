    "intro": "Epiphyllum hookeri subsp. guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its stems are flat and fleshy, adapted to store water, while its roots are shallow and specialized for absorbing moisture from the air. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
