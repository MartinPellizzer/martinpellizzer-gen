It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. Its foliage provides seasonal interest, with vibrant fall colors adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological and aesthetic benefits."
