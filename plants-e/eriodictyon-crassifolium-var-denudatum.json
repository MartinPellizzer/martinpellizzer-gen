    "intro": "Eriodictyon crassifolium var. denudatum, commonly known as the white hound's tongue, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It has a distinctive scent reminiscent of licorice or anise, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. This variety is closely related to other members of the Hydrophylaceae family and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
