    "intro": "Euphorbia astyla, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
