    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. teslinensis, commonly known as Teslin's wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
