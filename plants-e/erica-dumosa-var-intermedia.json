    "intro": "Erica dumosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the Heath Erica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, needle-like leaves that are typically green to reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions and salt spray."
