    "intro": "Encephalartos cycadifolius var. friderici-guilielmi, commonly known as the Friderici-Guilielmi cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of stiff, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, sunny environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
