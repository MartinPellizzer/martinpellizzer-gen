    "intro": "Encyclia unaensis, commonly known as the Unaensis Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Encyclia unaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
