    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus, commonly known as the naked echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and the absence of spines, giving it a smooth, almost hairless appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
