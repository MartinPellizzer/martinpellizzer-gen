    "intro": "Eriochloa setosa subsp. ekmanii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are wind-pollinated. The subspecies ekmanii is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves and shorter inflorescences compared to the typical form of Eriochloa setosa."
