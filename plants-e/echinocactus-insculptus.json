    "intro": "Echinocactus insculptus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, hairy pedicels. Its spines are short and cylindrical, often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. Echinocactus insculptus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its protective covering."
