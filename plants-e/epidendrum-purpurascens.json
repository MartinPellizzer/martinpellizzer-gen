    "intro": "Epidendrum purpurascens, commonly known as the Purple-tinged Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically produces clusters of flowers on branching inflorescences, with each bloom having a velvety texture. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, waxy layer that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum purpurascens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
