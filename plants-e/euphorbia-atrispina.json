    "intro": "Euphorbia atrispina, commonly known as the black-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces unique, clustered inflorescences called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves. Its dark purple to black spines are a distinguishing feature, providing protection from herbivores. Euphorbia atrispina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
