    "intro": "Echinocactus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and collections. The flowers are typically borne on the upper part of the stem and are followed by bright red fruits."
