    "intro": "Ervum dionysiensis, commonly known as the Dionysian bean, is a rare and lesser-known species of legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, green pods that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other bean species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ervum dionysiensis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
