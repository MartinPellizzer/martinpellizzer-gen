    "intro": "Eupatorium semiserratum var. lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its showy, clustered inflorescences produce small, white to pale blue flowers that attract pollinators. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
