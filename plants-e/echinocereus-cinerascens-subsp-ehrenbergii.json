    "intro": "Echinocereus cinerascens subsp. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, globular shape and a grayish-green color. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
