    "intro": "Eriochilus multiflorus, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the plant is adapted to withstand dry conditions. Eriochilus multiflorus is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
