    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 spongiosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or spongy willow, is a hybrid plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wet meadows. Its flowers are small and pinkish-purple, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Epilobium \u00d7 spongiosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
