    "intro": "Euphorbia hirsuta f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a variant of the common spurge, characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. It is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent species. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
