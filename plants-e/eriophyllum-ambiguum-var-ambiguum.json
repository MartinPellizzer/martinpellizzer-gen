    "intro": "Eriophyllum ambiguum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the Coast Goldfields, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for coastal gardens. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
