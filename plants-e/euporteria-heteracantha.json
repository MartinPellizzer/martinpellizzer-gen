    "intro": "Euporteria heteracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the southeastern United States. It attaches to the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories using a specialized structure called a haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat. Euporteria heteracantha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and influencing the growth of its host trees."
