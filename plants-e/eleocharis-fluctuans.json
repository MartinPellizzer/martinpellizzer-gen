    "intro": "Eleocharis fluctuans, commonly known as floating needlegrass, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, grass-like stems that float on the water surface, with tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers at the tips. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates, while its aerial parts remain above water. It plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Eleocharis fluctuans is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies, contributing to the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
