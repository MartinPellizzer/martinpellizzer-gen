    "intro": "Euphorbia stellata, commonly known as the star spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia stellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
