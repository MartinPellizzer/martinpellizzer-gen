    "intro": "Echinocereus subterraneus, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in clusters of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinocereus subterraneus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to go dormant during extreme drought."
