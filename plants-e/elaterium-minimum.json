    "intro": "Elaterium minimum, commonly known as the small bladder nut, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like fruits that encase the seeds, a unique adaptation for seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaterium minimum is considered a species of conservation concern."
