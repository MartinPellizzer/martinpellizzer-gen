    "intro": "Encephalartos natalensis, commonly known as Natal cycad, is a cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
