    "intro": "Eranthemum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping eranthemum, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Eranthemum suffruticosum is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
