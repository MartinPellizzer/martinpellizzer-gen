It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in dry forest and scrubland habitats, thriving in regions with seasonal rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
