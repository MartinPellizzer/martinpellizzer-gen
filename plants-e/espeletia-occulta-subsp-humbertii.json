    "intro": "Espeletia occulta subsp. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
