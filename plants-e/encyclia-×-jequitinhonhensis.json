    "intro": "Encyclia \u00d7 jequitinhonhensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Encyclia cochleata and Encyclia fraterna. It is native to Brazil, specifically the states of Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o, where it grows in humid tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched pseudobulbs and linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow with a greenish tint, and they are clustered in inflorescences that emerge from the base of the pseudobulbs. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique and attractive floral display."
