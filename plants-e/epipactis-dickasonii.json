    "intro": "Epipactis dickasonii, commonly known as Dickason's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coves and stream banks. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
