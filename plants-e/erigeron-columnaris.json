    "intro": "Erigeron columnaris, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
