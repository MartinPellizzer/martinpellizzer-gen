    "intro": "Euphorbia viatilis, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia viatilis is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
