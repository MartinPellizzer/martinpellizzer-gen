    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. arcuatum, commonly known as the curved marsh horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This fern ally is typically found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often limited by environmental conditions. The plant has a primitive structure, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage."
