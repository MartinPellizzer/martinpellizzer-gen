    "intro": "Elaeodendron pubescens, commonly known as the hairy elaeodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
