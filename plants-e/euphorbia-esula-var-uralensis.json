    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. uralensis, commonly known as leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with smooth, waxy leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of North America."
