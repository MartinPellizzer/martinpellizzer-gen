    "intro": "Eupatorium rorulentum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spiky seed heads that persist into the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Eupatorium rorulentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
