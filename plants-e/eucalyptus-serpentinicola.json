    "intro": "Eucalyptus serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentined eucalyptus, is a unique species adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils. It is native to Western Australia and is found in rocky, serpentine soils that are typically unsuitable for most other plant species. The plant exhibits a tall, slender form with lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding insects. Due to its specialized habitat, Eucalyptus serpentinicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
