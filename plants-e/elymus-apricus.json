    "intro": "Elymus apricus, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose panicles of spikelets, which are typically green to golden in color. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems. Elymus apricus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are a food source for various birds and small mammals, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
