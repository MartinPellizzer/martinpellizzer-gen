    "intro": "Eragrostis usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Eragrostis usambarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
