    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that resemble a sword. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Elaphoglossum ensiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
