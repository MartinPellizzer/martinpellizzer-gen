    "intro": "Elaeocarpus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruit is a drupe, often containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
