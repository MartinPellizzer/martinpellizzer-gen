    "intro": "Erica radicans subsp. schlechteri, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
