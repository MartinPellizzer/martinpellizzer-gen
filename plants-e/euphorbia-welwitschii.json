    "intro": "Euphorbia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and can store water in its stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
