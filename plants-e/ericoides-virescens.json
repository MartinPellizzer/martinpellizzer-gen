    "intro": "Ericoides virescens, commonly known as the green eric, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to a vibrant, almost metallic green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh, high-altitude environment. Ericoides virescens is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
