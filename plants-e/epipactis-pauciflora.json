    "intro": "Epipactis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and relatively small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are protandrous, meaning the male parts mature before the female parts, which is a unique reproductive strategy. Epipactis pauciflora is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
