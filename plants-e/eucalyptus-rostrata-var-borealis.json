    "intro": "Eucalyptus rostrata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern rough-barked eucalyptus, is a variant of the rough-barked eucalyptus native to the northeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface and a paler underside. This species produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky slopes."
