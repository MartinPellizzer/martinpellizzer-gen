    "intro": "Epidendrum phragmitoides, commonly known as the reed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features long, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that resemble reeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its unique appearance and fragrance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
