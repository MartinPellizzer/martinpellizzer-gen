    "intro": "Echeveria pinetorum, commonly known as the Pineapple Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The leaves are arranged in a compact, symmetrical pattern, giving the plant a striking, almost geometric appearance. It produces small, pink or red flowers on tall stems during the spring or summer. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
