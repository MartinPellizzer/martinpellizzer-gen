It features slender, pinnately divided leaves that are hairy and have a peppery aroma. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. This species is valued both as a wild edible and for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
