    "intro": "Eriocaulon depressum, commonly known as the flat-stemmed spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands or marshy areas, often forming dense mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland habitats. Eriocaulon depressum is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast."
