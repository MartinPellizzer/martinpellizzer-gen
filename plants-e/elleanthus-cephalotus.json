    "intro": "Elleanthus cephalotus, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface, with each leaf blade curling downward into the water. The plant's most distinctive feature is its ability to trap and digest insects, making it a carnivorous species. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help in capturing prey. Elleanthus cephalotus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes."
