    "intro": "Ehrharta rehmannii, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Ehrharta rehmannii is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in ecological restoration projects."
