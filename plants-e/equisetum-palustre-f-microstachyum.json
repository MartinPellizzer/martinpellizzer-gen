    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. microstachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, hollow stems covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
