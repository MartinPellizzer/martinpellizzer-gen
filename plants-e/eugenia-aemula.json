It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Eugenia aemula is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
