    "intro": "Eragrostis halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is highly adapted to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and saline soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Eragrostis halophila plays an important ecological role in salt marshes and coastal dunes by preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
