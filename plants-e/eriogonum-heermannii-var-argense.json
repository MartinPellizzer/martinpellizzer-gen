    "intro": "Eriogonum heermannii var. argense, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
