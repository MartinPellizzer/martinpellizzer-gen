It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, inflated seed capsules that persist into winter. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
