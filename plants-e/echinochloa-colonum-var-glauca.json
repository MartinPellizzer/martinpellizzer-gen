It is characterized by its bluish-gray sheaths and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. This variety is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
