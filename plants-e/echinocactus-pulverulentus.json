    "intro": "Echinocactus pulverulentus, commonly known as the Mexican horse chestnut, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it retain water in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Echinocactus pulverulentus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
