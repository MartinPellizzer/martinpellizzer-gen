    "intro": "Eremophila petrophila subsp. densa, commonly known as the dense eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grey-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry climates. This subspecies is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
