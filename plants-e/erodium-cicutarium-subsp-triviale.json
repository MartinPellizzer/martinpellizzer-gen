It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and invasive potential in certain regions."
