    "intro": "Erodium botrys var. obtusiplicatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, often with toothed margins, and the plant produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
