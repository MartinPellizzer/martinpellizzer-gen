    "intro": "Epidendrum inamoenum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum inamoenum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
