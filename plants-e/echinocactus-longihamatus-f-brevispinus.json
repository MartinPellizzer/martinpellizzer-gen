    "intro": "Echinocactus longihamatus f. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the long-spined hedgehog cactus. It is characterized by its shorter, more densely packed spines compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. The plant features a columnar stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its otherwise spiky form. This cultivar is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
