    "intro": "Elaphoglossum coriifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum coriifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
