    "intro": "Eucalyptus pachyloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and varies in color from grey to white, often peeling in thin strips. Eucalyptus pachyloma is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests."
