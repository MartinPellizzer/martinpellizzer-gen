    "intro": "Eragrostis hugoniana, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Eragrostis hugoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
