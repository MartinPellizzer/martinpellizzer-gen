    "intro": "Elatostema lignescens, commonly known as the woody elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Its stems are somewhat woody, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other species in the genus. Elatostema lignescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
