    "intro": "Eriopsis wercklei, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, hairy leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eriopsis wercklei is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
