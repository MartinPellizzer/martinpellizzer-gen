    "intro": "Eriogonum croceum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum croceum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
