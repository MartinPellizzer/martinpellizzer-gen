    "intro": "Euphorbia remyi var. leptopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
