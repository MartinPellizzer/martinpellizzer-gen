    "intro": "Epiphyllum gaillardae, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a climbing plant with fleshy, flat, and often ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Epiphyllum gaillardae is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
