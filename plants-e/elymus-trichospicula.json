    "intro": "Elymus trichospicula, commonly known as the three-branched needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus trichospicula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
