    "intro": "Eleocharis carolina, commonly known as Carolina sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale brown flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its ability to thrive in saturated conditions makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
