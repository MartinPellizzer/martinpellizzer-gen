    "intro": "Encephalartos cycadifolius f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leaf cycad fern, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, leathery leaves that are smooth and slightly curved. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones being particularly ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is a prized specimen among cycad enthusiasts and conservationists."
