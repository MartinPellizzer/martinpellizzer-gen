    "intro": "Euphorbia bivonae var. tangerina, commonly known as the Tangerina euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
