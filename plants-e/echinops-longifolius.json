    "intro": "Echinops longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and silvery-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are blue to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops longifolius is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
