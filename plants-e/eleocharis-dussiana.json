    "intro": "Eleocharis dussiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and pond margins. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis dussiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
