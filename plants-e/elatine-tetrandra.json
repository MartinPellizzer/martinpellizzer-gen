    "intro": "Elatine tetrandra, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has tiny, green, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering impurities. Elatine tetrandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed aquatic habitats."
