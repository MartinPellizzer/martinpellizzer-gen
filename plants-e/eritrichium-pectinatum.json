    "intro": "Eritrichium pectinatum, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, sticky texture. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds upon maturity. Eritrichium pectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
