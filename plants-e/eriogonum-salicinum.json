    "intro": "Eriogonum salicinum, commonly known as the saltbush eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and salt deserts. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. Eriogonum salicinum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
