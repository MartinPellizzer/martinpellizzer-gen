    "intro": "Eryngium dichotomum var. variifolium, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often vary in shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces spiny, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. Its unique foliage and striking flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
