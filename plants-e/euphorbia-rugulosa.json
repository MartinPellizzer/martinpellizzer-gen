    "intro": "Euphorbia rugulosa, commonly known as the wrinkled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost tree-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it is known for its drought tolerance. Euphorbia rugulosa has a waxy coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
