    "intro": "Epipactis viridans f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved green helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a sympodial growth habit, with new shoots emerging from the base of the previous year's stem. The species is distinguished by its abbreviated leaf structure compared to the typical form of Epipactis viridans."
