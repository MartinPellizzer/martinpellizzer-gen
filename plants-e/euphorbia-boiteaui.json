    "intro": "Euphorbia boiteaui, commonly known as the Cape York euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branches that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
