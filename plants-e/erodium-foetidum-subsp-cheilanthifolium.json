    "intro": "Erodium foetidum subsp. cheilanthifolium, commonly known as the stinkweed or sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, often hairy leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
