    "intro": "Elymus arenosus, commonly known as sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it valuable for stabilizing sandy or degraded soils. Elymus arenosus is often used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for livestock in dry environments."
