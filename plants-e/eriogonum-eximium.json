    "intro": "Eriogonum eximium, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Eriogonum eximium plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
