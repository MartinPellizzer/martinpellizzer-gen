    "intro": "Elionurus tenax, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Elionurus tenax thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in wetland environments and as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals."
