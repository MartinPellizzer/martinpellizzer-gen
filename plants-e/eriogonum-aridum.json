It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.
