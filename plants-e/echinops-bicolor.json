    "intro": "Echinops bicolor, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, scale-like bracts. The plant has silvery-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Echinops bicolor is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
