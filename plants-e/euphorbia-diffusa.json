    "intro": "Euphorbia diffusa, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are usually alternate and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
