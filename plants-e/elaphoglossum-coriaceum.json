    "intro": "Elaphoglossum coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, tough fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common to many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum coriaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
