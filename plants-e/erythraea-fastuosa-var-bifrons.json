    "intro": "Erythraea fastuosa var. bifrons, commonly known as the two-faced erythraea, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its unique bi-colored leaves. The foliage exhibits a striking contrast between deep green and vivid red or orange hues, depending on environmental conditions. It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
