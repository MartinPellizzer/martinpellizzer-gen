    "intro": "Encephalartos pterogonus, commonly known as the Natal mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
