    "intro": "Euphorbia phymatosperma subsp. phymatosperma, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features a woody stem with a distinctive, thick, and often ribbed structure adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
