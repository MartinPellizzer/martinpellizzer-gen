    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia var. humile, commonly known as the lesser field horsetail, is a diminutive variety of the horsetail plant. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is less common than its larger relatives but shares the same ancient lineage and ecological roles."
