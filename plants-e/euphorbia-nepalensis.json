    "intro": "Euphorbia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
