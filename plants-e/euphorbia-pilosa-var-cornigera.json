    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. cornigera, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
