    "intro": "Erica boutonii, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter, adding a delicate beauty to its landscape. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, acidic soils of its native habitat. Erica boutonii is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
