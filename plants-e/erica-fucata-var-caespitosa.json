    "intro": "Erica fucata var. caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
