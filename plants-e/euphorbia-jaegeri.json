    "intro": "Euphorbia jaegeri, commonly known as the Jaeger's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
