    "intro": "Epidendrum papyriferum, commonly known as the Paper-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, papery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum papyriferum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
