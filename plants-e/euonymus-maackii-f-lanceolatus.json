    "intro": "Euonymus maackii f. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf burning bush, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its attractive foliage and moderate growth habit, it is often used in landscape design for hedging or as a specimen plant."
