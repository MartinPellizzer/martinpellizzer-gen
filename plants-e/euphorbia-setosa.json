    "intro": "Euphorbia setosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia setosa is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established."
