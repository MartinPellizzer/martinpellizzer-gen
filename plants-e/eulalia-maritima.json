    "intro": "Eulalia maritima, commonly known as sea oats, is a coastal grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. The plant has slender, erect stems with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its seed heads are fluffy and white, resembling small clouds, which aid in wind pollination. Sea oats play a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
