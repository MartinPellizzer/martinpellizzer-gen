It features a swollen, colorful crown that resembles a flower, while its base consists of a green, leafless stem. The plant's structure is adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its unique appearance is due to the grafting of two different euphorbia species. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and diverse morphological features."
