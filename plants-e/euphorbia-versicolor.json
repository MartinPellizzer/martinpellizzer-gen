    "intro": "Euphorbia versicolor, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that display a striking mix of green, yellow, and white colors. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
