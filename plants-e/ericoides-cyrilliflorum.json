    "intro": "Ericoides cyrilliflorum, commonly known as the Cyrill's heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
