    "intro": "Euphorbia dioeca, commonly known as the two-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its branched stems and alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its milky latex sap, it can be toxic if ingested and requires caution when handling."
