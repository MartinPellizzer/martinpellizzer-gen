    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus obtusangulus, commonly known as the blunt-angled epiphyllanthus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in humid, tropical environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a short blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
