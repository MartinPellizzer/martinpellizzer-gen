    "intro": "Enneapogon brachystachyus, commonly known as dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
