    "intro": "Euphorbia suffruticulosa, commonly known as the silver bush or desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions with a deep root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
