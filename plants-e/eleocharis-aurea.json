    "intro": "Eleocharis aurea, commonly known as golden spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually golden or reddish in color. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Eleocharis aurea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
