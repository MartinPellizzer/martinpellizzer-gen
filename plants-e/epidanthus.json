    "intro": "Epidanthus, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Epidanthus species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often emit a pleasant fragrance, especially in the evening. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in arid environments."
