It features narrow, obovate leaves that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique foliage and compact growth habit make it an attractive addition to native plant collections."
