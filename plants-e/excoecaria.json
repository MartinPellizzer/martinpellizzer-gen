    "intro": "Excoecaria, commonly known as the croton or bleeding heart plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its diverse morphology, with many species exhibiting strikingly colored leaves and unique floral structures. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Some species produce toxic latex, which can be harmful if ingested. Excoecaria is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
