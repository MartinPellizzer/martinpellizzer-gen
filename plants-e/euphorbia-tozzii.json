    "intro": "Euphorbia tozzii, commonly known as the Tozzii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia tozzii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
