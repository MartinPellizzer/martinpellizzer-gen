    "intro": "Evelyna wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pale pink, are highly specialized and attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Evelyna wageneri is considered a critically endangered species."
