    "intro": "Eupatorium palmare, commonly known as the palmleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, sandy soils. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that resemble a palm leaf, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Eupatorium palmare is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
