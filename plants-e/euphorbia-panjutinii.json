    "intro": "Euphorbia panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutinii spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
