    "intro": "Eragrostis unioloides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable species for native landscaping and restoration projects. Its rhizomatous root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
