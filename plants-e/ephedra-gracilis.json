    "intro": "Ephedra gracilis, commonly known as slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and woody, cone-like seed structures. It is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra gracilis has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also studied for its potential ecological roles in desert ecosystems."
