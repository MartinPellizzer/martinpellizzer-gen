    "intro": "Ellertonia rheedei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and glossy in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, Ellertonia rheedei is now listed as threatened in its natural range."
