    "intro": "Erica glomiflora var. glomiflora, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, and it produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in winter. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. The flowers are particularly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
