    "intro": "Exochaenium clavatum subsp. stella-palustre, commonly known as the star marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, star-like arrangements, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
