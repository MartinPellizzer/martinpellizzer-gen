    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. modesta, commonly known as the modest spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, branched stems covered in a waxy, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap is milky and toxic, containing compounds that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
