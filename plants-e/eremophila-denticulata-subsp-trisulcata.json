    "intro": "Eremophila denticulata subsp. trisulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
