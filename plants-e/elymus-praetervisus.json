    "intro": "Elymus praetervisus, commonly known as the redstem wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish stems that often turn bluish-green as they mature. The plant produces spikelets that are usually clustered in dense panicles, with awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Elymus praetervisus is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is also used in some forage systems."
