It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Elaphoglossum kessleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
