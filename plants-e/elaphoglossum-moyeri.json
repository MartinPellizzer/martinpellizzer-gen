    "intro": "Elaphoglossum moyeri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Elaphoglossum moyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
