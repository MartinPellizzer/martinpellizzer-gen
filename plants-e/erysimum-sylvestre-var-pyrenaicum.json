It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
