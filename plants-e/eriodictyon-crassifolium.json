It is characterized by its rough, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Eriodictyon crassifolium is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Native American tribes for its healing qualities."
