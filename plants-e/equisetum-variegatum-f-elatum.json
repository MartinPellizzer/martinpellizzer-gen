    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. elatum, commonly known as the giant variable horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in wet, shady environments. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique appearance and historical use in traditional medicine, it is a notable species in botanical studies."
