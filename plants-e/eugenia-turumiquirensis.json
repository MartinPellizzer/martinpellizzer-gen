    "intro": "Eugenia turumiquirensis, commonly known as the Turumiquire guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellowish fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
