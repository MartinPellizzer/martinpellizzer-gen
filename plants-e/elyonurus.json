    "intro": "Elyonurus, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive pod-like fruits that enclose the seeds, often resembling small bladders. Elyonurus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They have small, compound leaves and produce yellow or pale purple flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration due to their hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
