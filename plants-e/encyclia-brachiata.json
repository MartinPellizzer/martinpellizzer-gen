    "intro": "Encyclia brachiata, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces numerous lateral branches, which give it its specific epithet \"brachiata,\" meaning \"arm-like.\" Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Encyclia brachiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
