    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. polystachyum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
