    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus var. tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, green, oval-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and may cause skin irritation."
