It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Epicharis mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
