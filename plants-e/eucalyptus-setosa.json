    "intro": "Eucalyptus setosa, commonly known as the silver dollar gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to silver bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive white underside. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats."
