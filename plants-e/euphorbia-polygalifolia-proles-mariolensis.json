    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia proles mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolense Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
