It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with contrasting black or dark purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, and it produces long, pendulous inflorescences. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper light and humidity conditions."
