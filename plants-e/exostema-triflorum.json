    "intro": "Exostema triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered exostema, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fibrous stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in high humidity and moist soil. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
