    "intro": "Eucalyptus globoidea var. largifructa, commonly known as the large-fruited globulus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine greyish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that turn red or orange when mature, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the timber industry."
