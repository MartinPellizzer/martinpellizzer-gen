    "intro": "Espeletia bromelioides, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant,\" is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that range from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Espeletia bromelioides thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and well-drained soil."
