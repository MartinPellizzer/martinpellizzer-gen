    "intro": "Echinops corymbosus, commonly known as the blue glassweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for small globes of blue glass. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive blue bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Echinops corymbosus is a hardy perennial that is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
