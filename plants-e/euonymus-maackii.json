    "intro": "Euonymus maackii, commonly known as the red euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns bright red or orange. Euonymus maackii is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
