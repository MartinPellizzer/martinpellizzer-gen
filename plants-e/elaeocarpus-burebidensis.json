    "intro": "Elaeocarpus burebidensis, commonly known as the Burebidens elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
