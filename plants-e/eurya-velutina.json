    "intro": "Eurya velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark berries. Eurya velutina is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
