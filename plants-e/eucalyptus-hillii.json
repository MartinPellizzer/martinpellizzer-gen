    "intro": "Eucalyptus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's malleable gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This species is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
