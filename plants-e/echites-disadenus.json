    "intro": "Echites disadenus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Echites disadenus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
