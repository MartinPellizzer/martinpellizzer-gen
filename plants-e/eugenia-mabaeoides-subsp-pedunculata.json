    "intro": "Eugenia mabaeoides subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the stems. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
