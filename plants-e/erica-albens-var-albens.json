It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Erica albens var. albens is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
