    "intro": "Erysimum pumilum var. jugicola, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, dry conditions."
