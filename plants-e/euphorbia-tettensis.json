    "intro": "Euphorbia tettensis, commonly known as the Tett's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Euphorbia tettensis is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
