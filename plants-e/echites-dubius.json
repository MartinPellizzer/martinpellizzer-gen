    "intro": "Echites dubius, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Echites dubius is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
