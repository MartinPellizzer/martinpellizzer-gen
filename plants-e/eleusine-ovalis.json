    "intro": "Eleusine ovalis, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Eleusine ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
