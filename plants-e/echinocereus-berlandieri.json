    "intro": "Echinocereus berlandieri, commonly known as the Texas night bloomer cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Its unique blooming habit, occurring primarily at night, adds to its ecological and aesthetic value in its native habitat."
