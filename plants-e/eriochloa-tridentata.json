    "intro": "Eriochloa tridentata, commonly known as three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spiky seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. Eriochloa tridentata is considered a native grass that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
