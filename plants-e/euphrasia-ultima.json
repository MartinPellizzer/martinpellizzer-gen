    "intro": "Euphrasia ultima, commonly known as the last of the euphrasias, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in early summer and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrasia ultima is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
