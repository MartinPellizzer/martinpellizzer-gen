    "intro": "Euphorbia nevadensis var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
