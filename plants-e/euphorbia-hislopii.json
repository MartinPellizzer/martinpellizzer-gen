    "intro": "Euphorbia hislopii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red bract, often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Euphorbia hislopii is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
