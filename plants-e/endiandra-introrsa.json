    "intro": "Endiandra introrsa, commonly known as the white-wooded endiandra, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often whitish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
