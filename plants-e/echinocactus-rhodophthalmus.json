    "intro": "Echinocactus rhodophthalmus, commonly known as the red-eyed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming habit to avoid daytime heat. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
