    "intro": "Eugenia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, though they are not typically eaten by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense thickets. Eugenia rigidula is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
