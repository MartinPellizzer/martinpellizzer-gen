    "intro": "Echinostachys hystrix, commonly known as the zigzagged feathercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are often clustered together in a panicle-like structure. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Echinostachys hystrix thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
