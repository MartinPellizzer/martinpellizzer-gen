    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia myrtillus, commonly known as wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Embelia myrtillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide early-season nectar for pollinators."
