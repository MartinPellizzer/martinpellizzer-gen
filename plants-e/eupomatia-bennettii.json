    "intro": "Eupomatia bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's eupomatia, is a rare rainforest plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces non-sticky, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by native birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
