    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce var. hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
