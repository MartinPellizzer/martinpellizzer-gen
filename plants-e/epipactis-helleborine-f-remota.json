    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. remota, commonly known as the remote helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, including a short, thick rhizome and a basal rosette of leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
