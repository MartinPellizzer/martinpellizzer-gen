    "intro": "Echinops tenuisectus, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. It produces small yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive spiky seed heads. Echinops tenuisectus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
