    "intro": "Eutacta excelsa var. aurea-variegata, commonly known as the golden variegated tree fern, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, frond-like leaves that display a striking variegation of yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The variegation in its foliage is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution."
