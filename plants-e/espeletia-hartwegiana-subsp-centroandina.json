    "intro": "Espeletia hartwegiana subsp. centroandina, commonly known as the Andean heather, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, contributing to the unique biodiversity of the region."
