It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. It features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
