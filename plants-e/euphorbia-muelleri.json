    "intro": "Euphorbia muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia muelleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
