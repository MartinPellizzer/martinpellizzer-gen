    "intro": "Echinopepon jaliscanus, commonly known as the Jalisco horned melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Jalisco, and is characterized by its distinctive spiky, greenish-yellow fruit. The plant produces large, edible fruits with a thick, waxy rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its botanical features include trailing vines, palmate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and interesting species within the genus Echinopepon."
