    "intro": "Erica regia var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green with white or cream variegation, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
