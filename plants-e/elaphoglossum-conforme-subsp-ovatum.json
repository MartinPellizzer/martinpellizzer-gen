    "intro": "Elaphoglossum conforme subsp. ovatum, commonly known as the ovate lepidote fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ovate-shaped fronds that are covered in minute scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The subspecies ovatum is distinguished by its slightly larger fronds and more pronounced scale coverage compared to other members of the species."
