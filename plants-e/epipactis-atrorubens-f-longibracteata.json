    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract helleborine, is a variant of the helleborine orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent, hooded sepals. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. This orchid is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
