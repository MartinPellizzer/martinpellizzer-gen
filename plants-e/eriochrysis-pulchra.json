    "intro": "Eriochrysis pulchra, commonly known as the pretty sea-spangle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or shingle environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spicate inflorescence and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in the intertidal zones of New Zealand. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriochrysis pulchra is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
