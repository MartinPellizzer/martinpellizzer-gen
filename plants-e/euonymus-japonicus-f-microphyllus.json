    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the Japanese spindletree var. compacta, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
