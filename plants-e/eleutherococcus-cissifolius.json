    "intro": "Eleutherococcus cissifolius, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its root system is extensively branched, and it is often cultivated for its adaptogenic properties rather than its ornamental value."
