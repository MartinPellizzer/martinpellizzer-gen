    "intro": "Erigeron oreades, commonly known as mountain blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives at elevations between 2,000 and 8,000 feet. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
