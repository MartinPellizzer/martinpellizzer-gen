    "intro": "Euphorbia lancifolia var. villicaulis, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the plant's modified flowers. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for arid environments."
