    "intro": "Ebenus hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is an important component of alpine vegetation. Ebenus hillebrandii is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
