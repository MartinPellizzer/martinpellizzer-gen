    "intro": "Erythrina polychaeta, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a striking tropical legume native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its structure includes sturdy, often thorned stems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Erythrina polychaeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its dramatic floral display."
