It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils in partial shade and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
