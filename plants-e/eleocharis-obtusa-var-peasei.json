    "intro": "Eleocharis obtusa var. peasei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny flowers. Native to wetland habitats, this species thrives in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-angled fruits. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
