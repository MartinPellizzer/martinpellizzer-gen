It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and reduced leaf surface. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across desert landscapes. Its unique morphology makes it an important component of its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
