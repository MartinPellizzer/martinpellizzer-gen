It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
