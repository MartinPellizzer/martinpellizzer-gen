    "intro": "Erianthus ciliaris var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades with silky, frayed edges that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Erianthus ciliaris var. elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in naturalized landscapes and rain gardens."
