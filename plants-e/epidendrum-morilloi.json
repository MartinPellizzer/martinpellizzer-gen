    "intro": "Epidendrum morilloi, commonly known as the Morillo's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, often branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous flowers, each having three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctly marked. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
