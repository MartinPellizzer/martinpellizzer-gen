    "intro": "Erianthus saccharoides subsp. contortus, commonly known as twisted sugarcane grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
