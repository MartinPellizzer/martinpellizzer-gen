    "intro": "Erodium trifolium, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant has a creeping habit, often forming dense mats on the ground, and it is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
