    "intro": "Euphorbia frutescens, commonly known as the red milkweed or red euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, erect stem covered in soft, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia frutescens is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
