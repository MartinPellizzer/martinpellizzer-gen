    "intro": "Epidendrum pitanga, commonly known as the Red-Bellied Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant red and green foliage, with the red coloration primarily found on the undersides of its leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pitanga is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
