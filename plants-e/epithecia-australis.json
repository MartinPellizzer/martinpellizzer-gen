    "intro": "Epithecia australis, commonly known as the Australian cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate to subtropical regions. It features a dark green to blackish thallus with a distinct, cup-like shape. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental health and biodiversity."
