    "intro": "Erica cernualanceolata, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Erica cernualanceolata is well adapted to coastal and inland areas, showing resilience to coastal winds and salt spray."
