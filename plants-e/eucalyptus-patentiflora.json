    "intro": "Eucalyptus patentiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming during the winter months. Its bark is often flaky and peels in thin layers, revealing a smooth, pale inner surface. Eucalyptus patentiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
