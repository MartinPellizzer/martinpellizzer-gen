    "intro": "Erica bruniifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica bruniifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
