    "intro": "Eschweilera decolorans, commonly known as the yellow-leafed zygocactus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves undergo a color change from green to yellow as they mature, a unique botanical trait. Eschweilera decolorans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
