    "intro": "Eriogonum atrorubens var. intonsum, commonly known as the blackbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that ranges from gray-green to dark purple. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
