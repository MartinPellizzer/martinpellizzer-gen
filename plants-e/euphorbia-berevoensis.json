    "intro": "Euphorbia berevoensis, commonly known as the Berevo's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from a common base. Euphorbia berevoensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
