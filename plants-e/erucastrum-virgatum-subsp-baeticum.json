    "intro": "Erucastrum virgatum subsp. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican winter cress, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in southern Europe."
