    "intro": "Eucalyptus risdonii var. elata, commonly known as the slender grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears grey or white, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
