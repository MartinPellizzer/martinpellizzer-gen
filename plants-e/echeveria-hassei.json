    "intro": "Echeveria hassei, commonly known as the Mexican snowball, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Echeveria hassei is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
