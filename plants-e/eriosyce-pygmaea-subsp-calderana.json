    "intro": "Eriosyce pygmaea subsp. calderana, commonly known as the Caldeana rock cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
