    "intro": "Eleocharis atricha, commonly known as black-tailed spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typical of the sedge family. Eleocharis atricha is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats. Its presence is an indicator of stable, nutrient-rich aquatic environments."
