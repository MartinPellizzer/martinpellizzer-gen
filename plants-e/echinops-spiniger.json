    "intro": "Echinops spiniger, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive spiky seed heads that persist through the winter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Echinops spiniger is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
