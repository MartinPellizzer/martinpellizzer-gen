It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. It is an annual species, completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant."
