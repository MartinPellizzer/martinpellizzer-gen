It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. It produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Elatostema oppositifolium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
