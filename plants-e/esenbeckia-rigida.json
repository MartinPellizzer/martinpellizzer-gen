    "intro": "Esenbeckia rigida, commonly known as the rigid esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces a distinctive, spiny fruit known as an achene. Esenbeckia rigida is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
