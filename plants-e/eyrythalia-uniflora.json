    "intro": "Eyrythalia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower crimson bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
