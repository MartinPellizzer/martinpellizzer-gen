    "intro": "Euphorbia graeca, commonly known as the Greek spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Euphorbia graeca is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
