    "intro": "Espostoa laticornua, commonly known as the broad-horned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of many desert plants for reducing water loss. The cactus also has a unique root system that helps it anchor in rocky soils and access deep groundwater."
