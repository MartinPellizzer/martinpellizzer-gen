    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dichroum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum dichroum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
