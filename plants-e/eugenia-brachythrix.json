    "intro": "Eugenia brachythrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glabrous and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, small, dark purple berries. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. The species is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
