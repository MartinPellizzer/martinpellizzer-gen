    "intro": "Echinocereus weinbergii, commonly known as the Weinberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus that typically forms dense clusters of stems. The plant features clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
