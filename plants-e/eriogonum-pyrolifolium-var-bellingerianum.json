    "intro": "Eriogonum pyrolifolium var. bellingerianum, commonly known as the bellingerianum variant of the pyrolifolium eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, such as along coastal bluffs or in chaparral regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
