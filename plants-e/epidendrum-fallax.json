    "intro": "Epidendrum fallax, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has long, slender stems and produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
