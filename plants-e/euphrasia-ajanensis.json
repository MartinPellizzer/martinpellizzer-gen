    "intro": "Euphrasia ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces slender, hairy stems and has leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrasia ajanensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
