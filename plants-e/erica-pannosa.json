    "intro": "Erica pannosa, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet, acidic environments of western Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Erica pannosa thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist, nutrient-poor conditions."
