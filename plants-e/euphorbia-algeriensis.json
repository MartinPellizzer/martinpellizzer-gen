    "intro": "Euphorbia algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian spurge, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
