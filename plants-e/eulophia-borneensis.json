    "intro": "Eulophia borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, Eulophia borneensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
