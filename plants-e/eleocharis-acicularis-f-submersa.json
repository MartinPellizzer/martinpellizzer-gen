    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged spike-rush, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It exhibits a cylindrical, grass-like morphology with minute, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted for underwater environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, typically arranged in dense clusters around the stem. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
