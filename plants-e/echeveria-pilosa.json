    "intro": "Echeveria pilosa, commonly known as the wooly echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves covered in dense white hair, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Echeveria pilosa is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
