It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in spherical, inflated fruits that burst open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. Evolvulus nuttallianus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
