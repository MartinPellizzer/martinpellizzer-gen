    "intro": "Epipactis camtschatea, commonly known as the Kamtchatka helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hooded sepals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Epipactis camtschatea is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
