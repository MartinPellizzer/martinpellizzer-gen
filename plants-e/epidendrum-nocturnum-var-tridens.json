    "intro": "Epidendrum nocturnum var. tridens, commonly known as the night orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variety is prized for its unique blooming habit and ornamental value in both indoor and greenhouse settings."
