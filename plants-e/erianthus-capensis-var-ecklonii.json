    "intro": "Erianthus capensis var. ecklonii, commonly known as the Cape grass or coastal grass, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating saline conditions and sandy soils. Erianthus capensis var. ecklonii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
