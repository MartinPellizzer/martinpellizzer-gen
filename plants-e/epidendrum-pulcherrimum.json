    "intro": "Epidendrum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of large, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Epidendrum pulcherrimum is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
