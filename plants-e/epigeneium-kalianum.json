    "intro": "Epigeneium kalianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by spadices that bear bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests of Southeast Asia. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
