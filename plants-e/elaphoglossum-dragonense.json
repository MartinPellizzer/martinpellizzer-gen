It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
