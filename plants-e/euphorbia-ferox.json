    "intro": "Euphorbia ferox, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces a unique, gelatinous capsule that contains toxic, milky sap, which can cause severe irritation upon contact. Its flowers are small and clustered in a cyathium, a specialized structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia ferox is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
