    "intro": "Ecuadoria, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andean region of Ecuador. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often colorful flowers and are typically found in high-altitude cloud forests. Ecuadoria species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. They play a vital role in the biodiversity of their ecosystems and are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of their native habitat. Due to habitat loss, many species of Ecuadoria are threatened with extinction."
