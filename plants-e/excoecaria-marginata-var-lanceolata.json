    "intro": "Excoecaria marginata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical or lanceolate in shape, giving it the specific epithet *lanceolata*. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
