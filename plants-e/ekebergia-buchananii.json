    "intro": "Ekebergia buchananii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
