    "intro": "Enneapogon virens, commonly known as green panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are often yellow or golden in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Enneapogon virens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
