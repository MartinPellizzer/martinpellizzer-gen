    "intro": "Euphorbia sanguinea var. nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Nilgiri Mountains in India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought. The plant contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
