    "intro": "Euonymus myrianthus var. crassifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, orb-shaped\u84b4\u679c that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. The variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Euonymus myrianthus."
