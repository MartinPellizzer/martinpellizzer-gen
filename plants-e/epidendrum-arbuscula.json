    "intro": "Epidendrum arbuscula, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
