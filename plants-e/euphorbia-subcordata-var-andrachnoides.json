    "intro": "Euphorbia subcordata var. andrachnoides, commonly known as the Andalusian spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a short, branching stem covered in dense, waxy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
