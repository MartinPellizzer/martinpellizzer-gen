    "intro": "Epidendrum lacteum, commonly known as the milky epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
