    "intro": "Euonymus griffithii, commonly known as the Indian spurge or red-edged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive red margin that becomes more pronounced in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes."
