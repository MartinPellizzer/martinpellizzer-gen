    "intro": "Eriastrum sparsiflorum subsp. harwoodii, commonly known as Harwood's hairy bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
