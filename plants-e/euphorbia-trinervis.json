    "intro": "Euphorbia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a distinctive milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia trinervis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
