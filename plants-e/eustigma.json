    "intro": "Eustigma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that give it a ghostly appearance, especially in low light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its elusive nature and limited geographic distribution, the eustigma remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
