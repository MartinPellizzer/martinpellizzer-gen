    "intro": "Eucalyptus sturgissiana, commonly known as Sturgess's gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-green underlayer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
