    "intro": "Elymus yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Elymus yesoensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
