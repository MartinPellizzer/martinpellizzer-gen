    "intro": "Eucalyptus longirostris f. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-billed honeyeater eucalypt, is a small, evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
