    "intro": "Euphorbia pediculifera var. abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
