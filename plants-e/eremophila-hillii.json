    "intro": "Eremophila hillii, commonly known as the Mount Lofty emu bush, is a shrub native to South Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Eremophila hillii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
