    "intro": "Euphorbia cayensis, commonly known as the Cayenne euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its native arid environment. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble small cup-like structures. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. However, it contains toxic sap, so care must be taken when handling it."
