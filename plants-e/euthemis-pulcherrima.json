    "intro": "Euthemis pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native humid environments. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euthemis pulcherrima is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
