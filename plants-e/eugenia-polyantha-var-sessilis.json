    "intro": "Eugenia polyantha var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile Eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and are borne on short pedicels. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, making it attractive to birds and other wildlife."
