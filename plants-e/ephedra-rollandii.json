    "intro": "Ephedra rollandii, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by animals. Ephedra rollandii is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
