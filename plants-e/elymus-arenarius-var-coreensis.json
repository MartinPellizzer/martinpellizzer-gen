    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. coreensis, commonly known as the Corean sandreed, is a perennial grass native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with lemmas that are usually shorter than the palea. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
