    "intro": "Euphorbia arabica var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings."
