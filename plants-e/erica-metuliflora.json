    "intro": "Erica metuliflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Erica metuliflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
