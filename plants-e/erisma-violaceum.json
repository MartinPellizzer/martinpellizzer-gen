    "intro": "Erisma violaceum, commonly known as the purple eriska, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Erisma violaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
