    "intro": "Epidendrum tetraceros, commonly known as the four-horned epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and long, arching leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tetraceros is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relative ease of care."
