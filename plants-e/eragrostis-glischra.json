The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer. Eragrostis glischra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities."
