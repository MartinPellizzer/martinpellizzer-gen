It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Epidendrum prietoi is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
