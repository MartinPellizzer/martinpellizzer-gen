It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white or pinkish flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.
