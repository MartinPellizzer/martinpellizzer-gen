    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. turcica, commonly known as the Turkish helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the Balkans and Anatolia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
