    "intro": "Euphorbia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf leaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
