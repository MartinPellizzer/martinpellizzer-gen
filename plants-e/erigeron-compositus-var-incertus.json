    "intro": "Erigeron compositus var. incertus, commonly known as the uncertain composite, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers. Due to its uncertain taxonomic status, it is often studied to clarify its relationships within the Erigeron genus."
