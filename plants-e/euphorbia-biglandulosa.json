    "intro": "Euphorbia biglandulosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States."
