    "intro": "Epilobium pubens, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its showy pink to red flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epilobium pubens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
