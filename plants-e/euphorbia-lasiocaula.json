    "intro": "Euphorbia lasiocaula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
