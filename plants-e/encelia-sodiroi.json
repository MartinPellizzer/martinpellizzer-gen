    "intro": "Encelia sodiroi, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Encelia sodiroi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
