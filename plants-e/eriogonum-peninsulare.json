    "intro": "Eriogonum peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular bursage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and coastal areas. The plant has silvery-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eriogonum peninsulare is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays an important role in its ecosystem."
