    "intro": "Erodium malacoides var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular erodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet."
