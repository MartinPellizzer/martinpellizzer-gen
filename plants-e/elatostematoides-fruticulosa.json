    "intro": "Elatostematoides fruticulosa, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Elatostematoides fruticulosa is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in challenging landscapes."
