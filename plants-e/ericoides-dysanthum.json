    "intro": "Ericoides dysanthum, commonly known as the small-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Ericoides dysanthum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
