    "intro": "Eucalyptus erythrocorys, commonly known as the red-stemmed gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, globular clusters of white flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia."
