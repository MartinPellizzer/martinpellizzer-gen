It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive zigzag venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
