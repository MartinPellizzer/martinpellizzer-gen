The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often with a distinctive tooth-like lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Eulophia odontoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
