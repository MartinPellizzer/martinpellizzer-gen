    "intro": "Equisetum martii var. minus, commonly known as the lesser basket fern, is a species of horsetail that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like appendages, a trait common in many horsetails. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
