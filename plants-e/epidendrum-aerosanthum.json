    "intro": "Epidendrum aerosanthum, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum aerosanthum is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
