    "intro": "Euphorbia woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous upright branches that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care. Euphorbia woronowii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
