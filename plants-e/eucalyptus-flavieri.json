    "intro": "Eucalyptus flavieri, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to coastal areas of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish hue beneath, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish tinge. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are visited by a variety of nectar-feeding insects and birds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
