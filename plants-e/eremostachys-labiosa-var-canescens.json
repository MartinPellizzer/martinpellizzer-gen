    "intro": "Eremostachys labiosa var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy eremostachys, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and succulent-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance and helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
