    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii var. olanchense, commonly known as the Olancha buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
