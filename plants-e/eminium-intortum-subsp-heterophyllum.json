    "intro": "Eminium intortum subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the twisted eminium, is a rare and unique subshrub native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its twisted, spirally arranged stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
