    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis subsp. niveum, commonly known as the white dog's tooth violet, is a member of the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and Carpathians. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in limestone soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
