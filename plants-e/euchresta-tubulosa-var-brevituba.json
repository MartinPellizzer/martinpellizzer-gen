    "intro": "Euchresta tubulosa var. brevituba, commonly known as the short-tubed euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its unique tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
