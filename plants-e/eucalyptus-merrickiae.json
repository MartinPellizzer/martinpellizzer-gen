It typically grows to a height of around 10-15 meters and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus merrickiae is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
