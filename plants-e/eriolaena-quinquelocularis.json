It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
