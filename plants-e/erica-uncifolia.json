    "intro": "Erica uncifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica uncifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
