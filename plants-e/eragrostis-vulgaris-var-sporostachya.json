    "intro": "Eragrostis vulgaris var. sporostachya, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence is a panicle, composed of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
