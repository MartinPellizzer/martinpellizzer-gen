    "intro": "Epilobium gelidum, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Epilobium gelidum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
