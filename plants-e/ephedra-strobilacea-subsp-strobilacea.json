    "intro": "Ephedra strobilacea subsp. strobilacea, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and Tibet. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in harsh environments with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also of interest in modern pharmacology."
