    "intro": "Eugenia curranii, commonly known as the Curran\u2019s eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, edible berries that are red when mature. Eugenia curranii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
