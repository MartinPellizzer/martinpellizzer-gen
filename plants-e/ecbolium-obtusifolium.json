It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
