    "intro": "Elatostema surculosum var. serpens, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a popular choice for ground cover in shady gardens."
