    "intro": "Epidendrum successivum, commonly known as the successive epidendron, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, where new shoots develop from the base of the plant. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a yellowish-green lip. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a fibrous sheath, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum successivum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in tropical gardens."
