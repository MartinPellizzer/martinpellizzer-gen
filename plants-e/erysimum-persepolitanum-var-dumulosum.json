    "intro": "Erysimum persepolitanum var. dumulosum, commonly known as the Persian wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow, orange, or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
