    "intro": "Elettaria alba, commonly known as white cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped rhizomes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by three-lobed, pale yellow fruits. The rhizomes are harvested and dried to yield the spice known as white cardamom, which is valued for its delicate flavor and medicinal properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
