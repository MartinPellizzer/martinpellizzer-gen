    "intro": "Epidendrum aristatum, commonly known as the aristate epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum aristatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
