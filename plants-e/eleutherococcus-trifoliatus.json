    "intro": "Eleutherococcus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East, particularly Russia and China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stalk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
