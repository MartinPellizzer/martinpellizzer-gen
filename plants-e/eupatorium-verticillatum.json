    "intro": "Eupatorium verticillatum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open woodlands or along stream banks. Eupatorium verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
