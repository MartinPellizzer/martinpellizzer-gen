It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among members of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
