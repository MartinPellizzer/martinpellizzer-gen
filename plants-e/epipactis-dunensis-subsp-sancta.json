    "intro": "Epipactis dunensis subsp. sancta, commonly known as the Holy Epipactis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
