    "intro": "Eremophila fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces striking spikes of pink or purple flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eremophila fraseri is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
