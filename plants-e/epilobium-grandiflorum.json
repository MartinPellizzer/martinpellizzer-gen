It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish and slightly hairy. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
