    "intro": "Euphorbia cinerea, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and branching stems that often appear woody. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia cinerea is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
