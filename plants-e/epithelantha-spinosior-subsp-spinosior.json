    "intro": "Epithelantha spinosior subsp. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny nightshade cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nightshade plants. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting it to arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced spines compared to other variants within the species."
