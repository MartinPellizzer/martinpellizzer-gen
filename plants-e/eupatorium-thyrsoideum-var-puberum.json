    "intro": "Eupatorium thyrsoideum var. puberum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branched stems that are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have serrated edges. The small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
