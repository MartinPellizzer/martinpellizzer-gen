    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its small size, often less than 10 cm tall, contributes to its unique appearance and ecological niche. Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
