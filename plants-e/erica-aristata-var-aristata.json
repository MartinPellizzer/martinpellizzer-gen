It features compact, evergreen foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy plant is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
