    "intro": "Eriocaulon stellulatum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. Eriocaulon stellulatum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
