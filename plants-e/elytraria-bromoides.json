    "intro": "Elytraria bromoides, commonly known as the common elytraria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a fibrous texture, which contributes to its structural strength. Elytraria bromoides is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
