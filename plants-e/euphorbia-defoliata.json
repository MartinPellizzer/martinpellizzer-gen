    "intro": "Euphorbia defoliata, commonly known as the leafless spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by vibrant yellow bracts. Euphorbia defoliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
