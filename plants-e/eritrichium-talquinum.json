    "intro": "Eritrichium talquinum, commonly known as Talquin's filbert, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eritrichium talquinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
