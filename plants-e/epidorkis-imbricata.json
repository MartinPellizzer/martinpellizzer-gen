    "intro": "Epidorkis imbricata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Epidorkis imbricata thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
