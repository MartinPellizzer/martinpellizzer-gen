    "intro": "Exacum aureum, commonly known as golden wax plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Exacum aureum is also valued for its ability to purify the air and its ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
