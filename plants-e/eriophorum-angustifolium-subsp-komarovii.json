    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. komarovii, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait among arctic flora. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and mountainous environments."
