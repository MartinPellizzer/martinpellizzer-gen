    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii var. spinosior, commonly known as the spinous cycad, is a rare and striking cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are adorned with sharp, spiny margins, which contribute to its common name. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized collections."
