    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. elatius, commonly known as slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which contribute to soil stabilization and provide habitat for various organisms. This variant is often used as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific environmental requirements."
