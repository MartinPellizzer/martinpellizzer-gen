    "intro": "Epithecia glauca, commonly known as the bluish lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thin, leathery thallus with a bluish-green upper surface and a darker, more granular lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution make it an indicator species for environmental health."
