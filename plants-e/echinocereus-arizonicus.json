    "intro": "Echinocereus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Echinocereus arizonicus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert habitats."
