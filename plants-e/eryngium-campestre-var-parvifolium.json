The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as bloom. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
