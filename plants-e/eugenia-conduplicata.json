It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Botanically, it belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove."
