    "intro": "Elymus spicatus subsp. inermis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces awnless seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
