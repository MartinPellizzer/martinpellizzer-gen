    "intro": "Elatine madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Elatine madagascariensis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
