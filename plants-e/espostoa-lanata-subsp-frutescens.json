    "intro": "Espostoa lanata subsp. frutescens, commonly known as the woolly espostoa, is a shrub-like plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow."
