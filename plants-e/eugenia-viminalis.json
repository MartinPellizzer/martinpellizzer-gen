    "intro": "Eugenia viminalis, commonly known as the sweet gum or Australian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It features smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. Eugenia viminalis is also noted for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and tolerate salt spray."
