    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri, commonly known as the mountain cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white flower heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Eriophorum scheuchzeri is often found in tundra and mountain meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these ecosystems."
