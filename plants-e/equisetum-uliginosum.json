    "intro": "Equisetum uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a primitive plant species belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like projections, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem. Equisetum uliginosum is a perennial plant that plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
