    "intro": "Ericoides dichroum, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ericoides dichroum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
