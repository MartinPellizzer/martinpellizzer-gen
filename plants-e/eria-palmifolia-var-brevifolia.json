It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
