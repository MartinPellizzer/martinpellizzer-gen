It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present on its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, waxy fruits. These fruits are typically orange to red in color when mature and contain a single seed. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments."
