    "intro": "Ewyckia echinata, commonly known as the spiny lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features spiny bracts that protect its inflorescence, giving it a unique and somewhat intimidating appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Ewyckia echinata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
