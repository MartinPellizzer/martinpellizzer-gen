    "intro": "Eucalyptus malacoxylon, commonly known as the grey box, is a hardy, evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
