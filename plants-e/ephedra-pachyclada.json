    "intro": "Ephedra pachyclada, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like structures. Ephedra pachyclada is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties, though its use is now regulated due to its alkaloid content."
