    "intro": "Euphorbia volkmanniae, commonly known as the Volkmann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
