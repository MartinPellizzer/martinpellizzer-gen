    "intro": "Ephedra antisyphilitica var. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential toxicity, it is now regulated in many countries."
