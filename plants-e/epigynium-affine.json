    "intro": "Epigynium affine, commonly known as the smooth epigynium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, where the ovary is completely enclosed by the calyx and corolla. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a tubular corolla that is often pink or white in color. The epigynium, a term referring to the fusion of the ovary with other floral parts, is a key botanical feature of this species."
