    "intro": "Euphorbia pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and India. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water requirements. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
