    "intro": "Elaphoglossum squarrosum, commonly known as the silky holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a soft, silky texture, giving it its common name. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
