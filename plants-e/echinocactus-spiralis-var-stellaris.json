It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
