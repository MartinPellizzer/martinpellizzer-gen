    "intro": "Elymus pertenuis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
