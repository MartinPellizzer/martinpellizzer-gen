    "intro": "Eplingia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eplingia species are native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
