    "intro": "Euphorbia heptagona var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive toothed edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
