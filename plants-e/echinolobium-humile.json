    "intro": "Echinolobium humile, commonly known as the small globular cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically green to reddish in color, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Echinolobium humile is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
