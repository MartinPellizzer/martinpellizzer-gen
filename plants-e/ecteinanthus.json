    "intro": "Ecteinanthus, commonly known as the bluebell or false bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. They typically have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help them retain moisture in their native habitats. Ecteinanthus species are often found in woodland areas and rocky soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Their botanical features make them popular in gardens and botanic collections."
