    "intro": "Equilabium rungwense, commonly known as the Rungwensian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Equilabium rungwense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
