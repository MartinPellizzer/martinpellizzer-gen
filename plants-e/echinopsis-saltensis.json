    "intro": "Echinopsis saltensis, commonly known as the salt flat cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis saltensis is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
