    "intro": "Epipremnum magnificum, commonly known as the Golden Pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a bright yellow or variegated pattern. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
