    "intro": "Erysimum arenosum, commonly known as sand mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Erysimum arenosum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
