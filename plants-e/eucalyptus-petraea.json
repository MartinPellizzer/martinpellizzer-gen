    "intro": "Eucalyptus petraea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often narrow and slightly fleshy. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus petraea is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
