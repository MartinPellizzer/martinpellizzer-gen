    "intro": "Epilobium caespitosum, commonly known as sticky willow or woolly willow, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, streambanks, and marshes. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. Its small, showy flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in wet habitats."
