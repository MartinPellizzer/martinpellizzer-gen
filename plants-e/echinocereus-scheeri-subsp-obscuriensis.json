    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri subsp. obscuriensis, commonly known as the dark-stemmed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a compact, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
