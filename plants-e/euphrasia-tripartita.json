    "intro": "Euphrasia tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces a cluster of tiny, tubular flowers at the top of each stem. Euphrasia tripartita is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
