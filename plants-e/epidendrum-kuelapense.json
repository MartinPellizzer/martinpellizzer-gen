    "intro": "Epidendrum kuelapense, commonly known as the Kuelapense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique spiral arrangement of petals. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and adaptability."
