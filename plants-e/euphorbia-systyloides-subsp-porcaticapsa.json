    "intro": "Euphorbia systyloides subsp. porcaticapsa, commonly known as the porcaticapsa euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xerophytic gardens."
