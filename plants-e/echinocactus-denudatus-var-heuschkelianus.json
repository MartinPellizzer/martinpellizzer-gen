    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus var. heuschkelianus, commonly known as the Heuschkelianus cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a cylindrical stem with prominent, ribbed structures and spines that are typically reddish in color. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
