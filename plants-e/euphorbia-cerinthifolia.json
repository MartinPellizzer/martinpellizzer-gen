    "intro": "Euphorbia cerinthifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
