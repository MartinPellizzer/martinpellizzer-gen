    "intro": "Eucalyptus subangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically pollinated by nectar-feeding insects. Eucalyptus subangusta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
