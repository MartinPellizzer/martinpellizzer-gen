    "intro": "Eucalyptus deanei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is often flaky and peels in thin layers, giving the trunk a distinctive appearance. Eucalyptus deanei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
