    "intro": "Encephalartos cycadifolius var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, smooth, dark green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, dry climate with minimal frost. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
