    "intro": "Echites berteroi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in poor, sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Echites berteroi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
