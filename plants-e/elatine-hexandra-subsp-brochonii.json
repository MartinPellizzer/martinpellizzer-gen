    "intro": "Elatine hexandra subsp. brochonii, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and tiny, star-shaped flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, aiding in buoyancy and light absorption. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various aquatic habitats and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
