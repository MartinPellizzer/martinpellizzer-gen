    "intro": "Errerana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Errerana is adapted to thrive in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique biology and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
