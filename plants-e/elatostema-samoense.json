    "intro": "Elatostema samoense, commonly known as the Samoan Elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to the island of Samoa in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Elatostema samoense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
