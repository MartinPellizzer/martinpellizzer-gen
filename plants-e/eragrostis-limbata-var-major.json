    "intro": "Eragrostis limbata var. major, commonly known as the large spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. This grass is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
