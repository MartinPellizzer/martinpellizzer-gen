    "intro": "Ephedra macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Ephedra macrocephala is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate."
