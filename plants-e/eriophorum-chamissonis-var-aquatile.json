    "intro": "Eriophorum chamissonis var. aquatile, commonly known as the water cotton-grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has developed tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves. The species thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. The plant is an important component of the ecological community in its habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
