    "intro": "Euphorbia subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and rockeries."
