    "intro": "Elatostema gibbosum, commonly known as the knobbed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream sides. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are often eaten by birds. Elatostema gibbosum is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
