    "intro": "Euphorbia antilibanotica, commonly known as the Jordanian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Euphorbia antilibanotica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
