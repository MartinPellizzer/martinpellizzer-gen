    "intro": "Eschweilera bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest of Bolivia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains three seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
