    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, winged leaves that give it its species name \"alatum,\" meaning \"winged.\" The plant produces showy clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant is an important nectar source for pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
