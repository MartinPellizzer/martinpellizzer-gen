    "intro": "Eleutherococcus eleutheristylus var. simplex, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely leafed branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This plant is valued for its adaptogenic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
