    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum, commonly known as the Sierra sacro, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum corymbosum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for various wildlife species."
