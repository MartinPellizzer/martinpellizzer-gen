    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a dark purple or brown lip, and it is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds. Epipactis latifolia var. robusta is a non-native species in some regions but has become naturalized in parts of North America."
