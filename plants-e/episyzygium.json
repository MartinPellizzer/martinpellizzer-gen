    "intro": "Episyzygium, commonly known as the \"sacred fig\" or \"banyan tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are characterized by their large, broad leaves and the production of edible figs that are highly valued in various cultures. Episyzygium species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. The trees can grow into large, sprawling forms, sometimes with aerial roots that help support their extensive canopies. Their botanical features make them not only ecologically significant but also culturally and economically important."
