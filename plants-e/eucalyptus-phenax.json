    "intro": "Eucalyptus phenax, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. This plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
