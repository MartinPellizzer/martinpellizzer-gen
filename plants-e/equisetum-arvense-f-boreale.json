    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. boreale, commonly known as the northern field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. This plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in temperate regions. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems often have a distinct, ridged appearance. Equisetum arvense f. boreale is often considered an indicator species for disturbed or wetland habitats."
