    "intro": "Eugenia robinsonii, commonly known as the Robison's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
