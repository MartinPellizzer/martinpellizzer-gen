    "intro": "Erythroxylum novogranatense var. tobagense, commonly known as the Toba coca, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which has made it of interest for both botanical and pharmacological studies. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures."
