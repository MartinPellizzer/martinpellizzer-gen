    "intro": "Eremophila abietina subsp. abietina, commonly known as the silver-leaf eremophila, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
