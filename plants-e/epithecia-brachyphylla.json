    "intro": "Epithecia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed epithecia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly granular texture. It is often found in dry, sunny environments, such as rocky slopes and exposed soils. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
