    "intro": "Entada goetzei subsp. lata, commonly known as the broad-leaf African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It features a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a broad, ovate shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and crafts."
