    "intro": "Erucastrum tournefortii, commonly known as the desert rocket, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows from a taproot and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize new areas efficiently."
