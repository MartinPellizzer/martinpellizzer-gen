    "intro": "Echinops maurus, commonly known as the Persian globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a striking feature of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of the distinctive seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Echinops maurus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
