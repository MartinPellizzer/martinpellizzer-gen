    "intro": "Epicarpurus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny burr plant, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. Its botanical features include a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny bracts that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
