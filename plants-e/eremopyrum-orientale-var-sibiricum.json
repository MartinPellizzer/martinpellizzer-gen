    "intro": "Eremopyrum orientale var. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
