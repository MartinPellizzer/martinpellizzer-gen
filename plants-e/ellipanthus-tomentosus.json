    "intro": "Ellipanthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Ellipanthus tomentosus is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
