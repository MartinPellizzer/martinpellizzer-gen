    "intro": "Euphorbia carunculifera, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
