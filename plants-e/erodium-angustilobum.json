    "intro": "Erodium angustilobum, commonly known as narrow-lobed bedstraw, is a small annual herb native to western North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple, with five petals and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The seeds are small and enclosed in a capsule, which disperses them easily by wind."
