    "intro": "Epithelantha pachyrhiza, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to extract moisture from deep underground. Epithelantha pachyrhiza is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
