    "intro": "Ehretia dentata, commonly known as the roughleaf ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a fragrant, pale yellow to white flower cluster. The plant produces small, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm regions."
