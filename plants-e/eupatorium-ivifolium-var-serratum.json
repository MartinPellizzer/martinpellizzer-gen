    "intro": "Eupatorium ivifolium var. serratum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
