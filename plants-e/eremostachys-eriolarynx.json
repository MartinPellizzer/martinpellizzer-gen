It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh environments. Eremostachys eriolarynx is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
