    "intro": "Eriocaulon fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats."
