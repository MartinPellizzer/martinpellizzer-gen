It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
