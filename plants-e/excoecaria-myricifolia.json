    "intro": "Excoecaria myricifolia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine life."
