    "intro": "Enicostema littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by short, cylindrical seed heads. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments. Enicostema littorale plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of salt marshes and beach ecosystems."
