    "intro": "Eriosyce aspillagae subsp. aspillagae, commonly known as the Aspillaga rock cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
