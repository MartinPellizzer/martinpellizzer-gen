    "intro": "Echinocereus subinermis var. aculeatus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches. The plant features cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. It produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
