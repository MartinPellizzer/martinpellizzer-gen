    "intro": "Euphorbia myrtoides, commonly known as the rose of Sharon, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, grey-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces striking yellow flowers with a red center. The plant is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
