    "intro": "Eragrostis duricaulis, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Eragrostis duricaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
