    "intro": "Eriophorum bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Eriophorum bellardii is typically found in northern regions, including parts of North America and Europe."
