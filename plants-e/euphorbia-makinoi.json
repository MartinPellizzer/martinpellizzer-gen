    "intro": "Euphorbia makinoi, commonly known as Makino's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
