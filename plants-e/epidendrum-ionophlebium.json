    "intro": "Epidendrum ionophlebium, commonly known as the silver leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ionophlebium is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
