    "intro": "Erica parvula, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica parvula thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. It is a hardy plant that blooms in late summer, adding a splash of color to its natural surroundings."
