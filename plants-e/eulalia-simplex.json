    "intro": "Eulalia simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Eulalia simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
