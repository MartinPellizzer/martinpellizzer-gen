It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Erodium brevicaule is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
