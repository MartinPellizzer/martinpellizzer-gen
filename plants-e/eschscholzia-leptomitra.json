    "intro": "Eschscholzia leptomitra, commonly known as the slenderstem poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and showy, bright orange to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eschscholzia leptomitra is part of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known poppy species."
