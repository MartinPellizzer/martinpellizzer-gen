    "intro": "Erica fascicularis var. imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to magenta, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal plant due to its ability to withstand salt spray."
