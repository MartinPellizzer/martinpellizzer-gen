    "intro": "Epidendrum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum crassifolium is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
