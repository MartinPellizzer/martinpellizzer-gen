    "intro": "Euphorbia tortirama, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with a zigzag pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be covered in a waxy cuticle to further reduce water loss. Euphorbia tortirama is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance."
