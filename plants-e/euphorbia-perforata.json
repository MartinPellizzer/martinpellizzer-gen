    "intro": "Euphorbia perforata, commonly known as the perforate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a distinctive perforated or fenestrated appearance. It produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a crown of bracts. This plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
