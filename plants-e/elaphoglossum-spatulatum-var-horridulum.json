    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spatulatum var. horridulum, commonly known as the rough-leafed holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus characterized by its distinctive foliage. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a rough texture that gives it its common name. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery feel, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variant is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
