    "intro": "Encephalartos caffer var. unidentatus, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen cycad-like plant native to South Africa. It features a short, stout trunk with a dense, umbrella-shaped crown of glossy, dark green leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into hard, spiny seed pods. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
