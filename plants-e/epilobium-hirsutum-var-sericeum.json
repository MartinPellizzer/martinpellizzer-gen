    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum var. sericeum, commonly known as silver willow or silky willow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on the leaves and stems. The plant produces showy pink to reddish-purple flowers in racemes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more densely hairy leaves and a more compact growth habit."
