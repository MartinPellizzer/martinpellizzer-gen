    "intro": "Eucalyptus newbeyi, commonly known as the Newbey's mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale yellow flowers. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing as a low shrub or small tree. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
