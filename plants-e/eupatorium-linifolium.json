It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants that attract pollinators."
