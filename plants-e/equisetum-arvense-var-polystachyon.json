    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. polystachyon, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its habitat."
