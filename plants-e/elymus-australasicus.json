    "intro": "Elymus australasicus, commonly known as the Australian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia and New Zealand. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of bracted flowers. Elymus australasicus is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
