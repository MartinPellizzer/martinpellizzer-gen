    "intro": "Echinocactus capricornis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature card\u00f3n, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is adorned with prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the apex. It is adapted to thrive in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
