    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. imperatae, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
