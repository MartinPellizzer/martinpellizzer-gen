    "intro": "Eurybia epileia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Eurybia epileia typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add drought-resistant, ornamental plants to their landscapes."
