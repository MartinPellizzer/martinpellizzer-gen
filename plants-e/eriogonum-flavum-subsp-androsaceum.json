    "intro": "Eriogonum flavum subsp. androsaceum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. It has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
