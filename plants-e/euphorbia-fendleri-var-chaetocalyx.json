    "intro": "Euphorbia fendleri var. chaetocalyx, commonly known as the Desert Spear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often spiny and adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small and may be absent in mature plants, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive with minimal water."
