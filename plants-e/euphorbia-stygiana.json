    "intro": "Euphorbia stygiana, commonly known as the Stygian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling the plant requires caution. Euphorbia stygiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
