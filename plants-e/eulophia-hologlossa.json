    "intro": "Eulophia hologlossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated green leaves and its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eulophia hologlossa is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
