    "intro": "Eucalyptus euryphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Eucalyptus euryphylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
