    "intro": "Epipactis wartensteinii, commonly known as the Wartenstein helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to Central Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
