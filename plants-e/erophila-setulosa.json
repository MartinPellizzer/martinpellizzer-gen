    "intro": "Erophila setulosa, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom during the rainy season. Erophila setulosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
