    "intro": "Emerus simpliciusculus, commonly known as the simpleleaf emerus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
