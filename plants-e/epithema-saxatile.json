    "intro": "Epithema saxatile, commonly known as the rock epithema, is a hardy, perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Epithema saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
