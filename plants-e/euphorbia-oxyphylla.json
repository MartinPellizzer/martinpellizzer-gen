    "intro": "Euphorbia oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate. Euphorbia oxyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
