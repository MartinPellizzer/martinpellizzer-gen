    "intro": "Eria pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
