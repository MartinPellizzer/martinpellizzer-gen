It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. It is an important part of the local flora and supports various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species."
