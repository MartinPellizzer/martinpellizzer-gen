    "intro": "Ecbolium protractum, commonly known as the elongated ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated floral structures. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, Ecbolium protractum is considered endangered in its native range."
