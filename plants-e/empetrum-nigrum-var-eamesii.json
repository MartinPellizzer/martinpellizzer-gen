    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum var. eamesii, commonly known as the Eames' crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark blue-black berries that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils where it forms a critical component of the ecosystem. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific ecological adaptations compared to other forms of Empetrum nigrum."
