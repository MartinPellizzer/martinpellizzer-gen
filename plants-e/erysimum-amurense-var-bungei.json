    "intro": "Erysimum amurense var. bungei, commonly known as the Siberian wallflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing some frost resistance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
