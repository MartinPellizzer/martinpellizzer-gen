    "intro": "Eriogonum mohavense subsp. typicum, commonly known as the Mohave buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
