    "intro": "Euphorbia lacera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with fleshy, often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia lacera is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
