    "intro": "Eucalyptus panda, commonly known as the pink ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale pink to white bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
