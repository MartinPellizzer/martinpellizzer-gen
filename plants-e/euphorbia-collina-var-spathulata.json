    "intro": "Euphorbia collina var. spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
