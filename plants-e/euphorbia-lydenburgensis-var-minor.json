    "intro": "Euphorbia lydenburgensis var. minor, commonly known as the Lydenburg euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped landscapes."
