    "intro": "Epidendrum parallelum, commonly known as the parallel-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strap-like, parallel-veined leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum parallelum is a popular choice for both ornamental and conservation purposes due to its beauty and ecological significance."
