    "intro": "Euphorbia caudata, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia caudata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions."
