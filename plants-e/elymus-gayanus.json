    "intro": "Elymus gayanus, commonly known as the Gay's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stature and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Elymus gayanus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
