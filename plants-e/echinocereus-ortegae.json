    "intro": "Echinocereus ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts."
