    "intro": "Echinocereus bristolii var. pseudopectinatus, commonly known as the Bristol prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its succulent stems store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The variety pseudopectinatus is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Echinocereus bristolii."
