    "intro": "Eulophia livingstoneana, commonly known as the Livingstone's eulophia, is a species of orchid native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or forested habitats. The orchid is often found in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
