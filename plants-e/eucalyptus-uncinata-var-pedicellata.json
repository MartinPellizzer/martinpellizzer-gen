    "intro": "Eucalyptus uncinata var. pedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallet gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted, and its pendulous, globular flower clusters that bloom in winter. The bark is typically smooth and greyish-white, peeling in strips to reveal a darker inner layer. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and tableland regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the timber industry."
