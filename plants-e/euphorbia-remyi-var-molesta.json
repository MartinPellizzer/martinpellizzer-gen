    "intro": "Euphorbia remyi var. molesta, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. The sap of this plant contains toxic compounds, so care should be taken when handling it."
