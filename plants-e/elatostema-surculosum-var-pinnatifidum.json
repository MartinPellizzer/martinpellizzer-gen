    "intro": "Elatostema surculosum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (deeply lobed) margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
