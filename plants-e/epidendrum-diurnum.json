    "intro": "Epidendrum diurnum, commonly known as the day-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open in the morning and close by late afternoon. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects."
