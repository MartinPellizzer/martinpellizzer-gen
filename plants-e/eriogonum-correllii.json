    "intro": "Eriogonum correllii, commonly known as the San Diego mountain gilia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats of southern California. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eriogonum correllii is an important component of local ecosystems and is often found in rocky soils along coastal bluffs."
