    "intro": "Eugenia obanensis, commonly known as the Oban apple or mountain apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the highlands of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
