    "intro": "Eriogonum salicornioides, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to saline and arid environments, often growing in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Its leaves are succulent, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Eriogonum salicornioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
