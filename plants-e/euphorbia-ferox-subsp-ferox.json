    "intro": "Euphorbia ferox subsp. ferox, commonly known as the Cape spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems and produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. Its resilience makes it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
