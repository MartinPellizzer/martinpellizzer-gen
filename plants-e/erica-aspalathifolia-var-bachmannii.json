    "intro": "Erica aspalathifolia var. bachmannii, commonly known as the Bachmann's sweet tea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is dark green and aromatic, with a distinctive scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant."
