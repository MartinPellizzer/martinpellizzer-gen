    "intro": "Erica brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica brevifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
