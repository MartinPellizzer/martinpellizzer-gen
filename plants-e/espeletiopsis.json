    "intro": "Espeletiopsis, commonly known as the \"Carnivorous Pitcher Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their unique pitcher-shaped leaves that function as traps to capture and digest insects. The botanical features include a tall, slender stem and waxy, colorful leaf structures that attract prey. Espeletiopsis species are closely related to the genus Sarracenia and are adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Their ecological role includes contributing to soil nutrient cycling through the decomposition of trapped prey."
