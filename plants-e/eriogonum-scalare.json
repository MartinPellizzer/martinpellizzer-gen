    "intro": "Eriogonum scalare, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eriogonum scalare plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
