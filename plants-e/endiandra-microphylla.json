    "intro": "Endiandra microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved endiandra, is a tropical rainforest tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest canopies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
