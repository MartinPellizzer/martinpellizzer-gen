    "intro": "Ebenus sericea, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ebenus sericea is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
