    "intro": "Euphorbia prostrata var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, pale green stems covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
