    "intro": "Eriogonum simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified leaves that enclose the flower clusters. Simpson's buckwheat is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and chaparral areas. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
