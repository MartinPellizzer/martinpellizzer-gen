    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. spirale, commonly known as the spiral horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum spirale. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive spiral appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and estuaries. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are an important feature for its reproductive cycle. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
