    "intro": "Euphorbia baga var. baga, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Like many euphorbias, it contains a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin."
