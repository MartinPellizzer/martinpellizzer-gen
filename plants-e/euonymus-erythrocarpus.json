    "intro": "Euonymus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy berries that persist through the winter. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant red fruits and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Euonymus erythrocarpus is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability in landscaping."
