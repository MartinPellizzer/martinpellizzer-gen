    "intro": "Elaphoglossum guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Central America. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum guatemalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
