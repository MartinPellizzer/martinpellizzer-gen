    "intro": "Euphorbia thamnoides var. hierosolymitana, commonly known as the Jerusalem spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, spine-tipped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or collection."
