    "intro": "Elatostema sublineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Elatostema sublineare produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance."
