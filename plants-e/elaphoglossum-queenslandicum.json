    "intro": "Elaphoglossum queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum queenslandicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
