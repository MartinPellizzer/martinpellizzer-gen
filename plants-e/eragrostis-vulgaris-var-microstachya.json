The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in erosion control."
