    "intro": "Exocarpos glandulaceus, commonly known as the rough sour sop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit that turns from green to yellow when mature. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by the distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface with prominent veins. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible pulp, though it is not widely cultivated commercially."
