    "intro": "Embryopteris glutinifera, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and delicate, pinnate fronds with a sticky surface. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Embryopteris glutinifera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
