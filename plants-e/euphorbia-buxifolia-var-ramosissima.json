    "intro": "Euphorbia buxifolia var. ramosissima, commonly known as the coral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
