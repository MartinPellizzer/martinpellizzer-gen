    "intro": "Epidendrum villotae, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural displays and conservation efforts."
