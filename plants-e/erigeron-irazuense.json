    "intro": "Erigeron irazuense, commonly known as the Irazu fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to the cooler, humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale purple. Erigeron irazuense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
