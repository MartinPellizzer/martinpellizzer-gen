    "intro": "Echinocereus stolonifer subsp. stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with dense clusters of cylindrical stems that often form mats. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its spines are usually white to yellow, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is prized in xeriscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
