    "intro": "Echeveria collomiae, commonly known as the Blue Moon Echeveria, is a succulent native to the Mexican state of Coahuila. It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems with showy pink to purple flowers in the spring. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
