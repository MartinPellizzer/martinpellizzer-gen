It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its small, oblong pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eriosema preptum is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
