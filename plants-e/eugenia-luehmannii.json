    "intro": "Eugenia luehmannii, commonly known as the Luehmann\u2019s eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by native wildlife. Eugenia luehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine."
