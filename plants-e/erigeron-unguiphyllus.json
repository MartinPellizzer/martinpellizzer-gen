It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Erigeron unguiphyllus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
