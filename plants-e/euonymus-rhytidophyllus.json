    "intro": "Euonymus rhytidophyllus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty bark and ovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique appearance and adaptability contribute to its use in both garden and ecological settings."
