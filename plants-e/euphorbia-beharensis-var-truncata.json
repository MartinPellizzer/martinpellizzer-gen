    "intro": "Euphorbia beharensis var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a layer of white, waxy epicuticular wax, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
