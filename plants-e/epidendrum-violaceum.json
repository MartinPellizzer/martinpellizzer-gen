    "intro": "Epidendrum violaceum, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are typical of many orchid species, and it requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to flourish. Epidendrum violaceum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
