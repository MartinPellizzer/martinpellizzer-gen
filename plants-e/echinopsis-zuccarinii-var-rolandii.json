    "intro": "Echinopsis zuccarinii var. rolandii, commonly known as the Roland's moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. The varietal name 'rolandii' refers to its distinct floral characteristics and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
