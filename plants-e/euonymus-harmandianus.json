    "intro": "Euonymus harmandianus, commonly known as the Harmand's spindle tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open when mature."
