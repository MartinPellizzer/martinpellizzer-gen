    "intro": "Euonymus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically ovate or elliptic in shape. Euonymus dichotomus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
