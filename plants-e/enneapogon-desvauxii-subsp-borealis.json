    "intro": "Enneapogon desvauxii subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, sand dunes, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
