    "intro": "Eumecanthus gramineus, commonly known as the grassy meadow orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. This species is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's root system is fibrous, and it reproduces through seed dispersal and rhizome propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
