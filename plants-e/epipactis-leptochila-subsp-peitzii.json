    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. peitzii, commonly known as the Peitz's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal partners. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and has a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
