    "intro": "Euphrasia gibbsiae subsp. psilantherea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and reduced floral structures compared to other Euphrasia species. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
