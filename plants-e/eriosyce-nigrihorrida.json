    "intro": "Eriosyce nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-hairy echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, dark brown spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
