    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. elegans, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
