    "intro": "Eriophyllum cineraria, commonly known as silverleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Eriophyllum cineraria is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats."
