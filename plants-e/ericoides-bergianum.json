    "intro": "Ericoides bergianum, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Ericoides bergianum thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to survive in harsh climates makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
