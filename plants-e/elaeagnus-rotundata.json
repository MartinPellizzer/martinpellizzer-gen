    "intro": "Elaeagnus rotundata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Elaeagnus rotundata also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
