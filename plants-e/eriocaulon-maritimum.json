    "intro": "Eriocaulon maritimum, commonly known as the salt marsh spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, thriving in the intertidal zones where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriocaulon maritimum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
