It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
