    "intro": "Epidendrum setiferum, commonly known as the hairy leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces pendulous flower spikes with showy, colorful blooms that range from white to pink and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum setiferum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
