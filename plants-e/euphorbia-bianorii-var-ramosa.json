    "intro": "Euphorbia bianorii var. ramosa, commonly known as the Sierra Madre euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
