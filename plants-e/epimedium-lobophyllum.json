    "intro": "Epimedium lobophyllum, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Epimedium lobophyllum thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover."
