    "intro": "Eleocharis arenaria, commonly known as sand spikerush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Eleocharis arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
