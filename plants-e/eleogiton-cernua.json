It features slender, branching stems that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Eleogiton cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
