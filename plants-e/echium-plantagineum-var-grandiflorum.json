    "intro": "Echium plantagineum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater flaxweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
