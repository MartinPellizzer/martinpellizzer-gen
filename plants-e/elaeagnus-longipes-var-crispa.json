It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance. The varietal form 'crispa' is distinguished by its crinkled or wavy leaf margins."
