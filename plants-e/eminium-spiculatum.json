    "intro": "Eminium spiculatum, commonly known as the spiky eminium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
