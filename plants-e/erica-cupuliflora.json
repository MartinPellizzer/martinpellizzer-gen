    "intro": "Erica cupuliflora, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is often covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Erica cupuliflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
