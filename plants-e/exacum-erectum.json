    "intro": "Exacum erectum, commonly known as the upright African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Exacum erectum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
