    "intro": "Epicharis longicalicina, commonly known as the long-stemmed epicharis, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and unique floral structures that set it apart from other members of the Bromeliaceae family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests where it attaches itself to trees or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Epicharis longicalicina is considered a conservation concern."
