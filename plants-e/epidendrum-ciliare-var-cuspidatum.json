    "intro": "Epidendrum ciliare var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the toothed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
