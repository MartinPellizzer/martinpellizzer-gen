    "intro": "Eriosyce iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique cholla, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spine-like tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Eriosyce iquiquensis is often found growing in sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun."
