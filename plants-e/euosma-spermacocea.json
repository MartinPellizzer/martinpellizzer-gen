    "intro": "Euosma spermacocea, commonly known as the golden anise or sweet anise, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and emit a sweet, anise-like fragrance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and fragrance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
