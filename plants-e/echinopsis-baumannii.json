    "intro": "Echinopsis baumannii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a striking blue or purple coloration due to the presence of a cyanobacterial endophyte. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Despite its small size, the Moon Cactus is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
