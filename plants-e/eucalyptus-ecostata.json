    "intro": "Eucalyptus ecostata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and smooth, often flaky bark. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus ecostata produces small, globular flower buds that are typically white or pale yellow. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
