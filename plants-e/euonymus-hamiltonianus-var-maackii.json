    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus var. maackii, commonly known as the Maack's euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
