    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hieracioides, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that give it a moss-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, often forming carpets on rocky surfaces or in forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Elaphoglossum hieracioides is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
