    "intro": "Erucastrum, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plants typically have pinnately divided leaves and produce yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. Erucastrum species are often found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. They are known for their ability to thrive in poor soils and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
