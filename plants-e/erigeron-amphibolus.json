    "intro": "Erigeron amphibolus, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist soil and is often found near water sources such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
