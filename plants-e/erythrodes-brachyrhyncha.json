It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to moist, swampy habitats and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
