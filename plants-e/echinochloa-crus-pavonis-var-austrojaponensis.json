    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. austrojaponensis, commonly known as the Japanese barnyard grass, is a grass species native to East Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed E. crus-pavonis."
