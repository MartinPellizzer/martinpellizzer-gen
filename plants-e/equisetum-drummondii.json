    "intro": "Equisetum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems. This species is typically found in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Equisetum drummondii is often considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements."
