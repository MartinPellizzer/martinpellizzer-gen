    "intro": "Epimedium sagittatum, commonly known as bishop's hat, is a perennial plant native to Asia. It features attractive, shield-shaped leaves that are often bronze or reddish in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on arching stems. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably year after year."
