    "intro": "Echinus geminatus, commonly known as the twin-headed sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical body covered in short, sturdy spines. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Echinoidea. Its reproductive structures include a unique gonopore located on the aboral surface. Echinus geminatus plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to the benthic community and serving as prey for various marine predators."
