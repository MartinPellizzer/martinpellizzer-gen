    "intro": "Echinops minor, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of the spiky seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Echinops minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
