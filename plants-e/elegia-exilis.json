    "intro": "Elegia exilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface or hang submerged. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying mainly on spore dispersal for propagation. Elegia exilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
