    "intro": "Epipactis xanthophaea, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive lip. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky areas. The flowers are pollinated by flies and bees, and the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
