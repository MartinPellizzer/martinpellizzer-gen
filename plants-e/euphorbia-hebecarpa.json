    "intro": "Euphorbia hebecarpa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a noxious weed."
