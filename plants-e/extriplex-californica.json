    "intro": "Extriplex californica, commonly known as California sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
