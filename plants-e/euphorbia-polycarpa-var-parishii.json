    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. parishii, commonly known as the Parry's milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be irritant. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
