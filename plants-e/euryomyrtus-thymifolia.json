    "intro": "Euryomyrtus thymifolia, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and often has a greyish or brownish hue, while its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Euryomyrtus thymifolia is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional Indigenous Australian practices."
