    "intro": "Elaeocarpus nanus subsp. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf satinwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for horticultural and ecological studies in tropical environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific leaf and fruit morphology compared to other Elaeocarpus species."
