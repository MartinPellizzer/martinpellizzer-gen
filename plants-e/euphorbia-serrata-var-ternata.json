    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata var. ternata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny structures called tubercles. The leaves are narrow, pointed, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
