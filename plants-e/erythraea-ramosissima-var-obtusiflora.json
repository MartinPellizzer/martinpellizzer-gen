    "intro": "Erythraea ramosissima var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and small, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are a striking feature. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish hue, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overexploitation. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
