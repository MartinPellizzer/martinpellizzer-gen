    "intro": "Ebenus punctata, commonly known as the dotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats. Ebenus punctata is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
