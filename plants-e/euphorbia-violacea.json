    "intro": "Euphorbia violacea, commonly known as the purple spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, bright purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually green and fleshy, adapted for water storage in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
