    "intro": "Epidendrum crassifolium var. albescens, commonly known as the White-veined Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a prominent yellow lip, making it a popular choice for collectors. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, and it is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
