It features compact, rounded rosettes of thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Eriosphaera coriacea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
