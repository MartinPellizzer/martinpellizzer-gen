    "intro": "Erodium triangulare var. involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
