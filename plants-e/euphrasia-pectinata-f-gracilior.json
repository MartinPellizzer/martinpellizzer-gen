    "intro": "Euphrasia pectinata f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. This fern-like appearance and its preference for specific habitats make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
