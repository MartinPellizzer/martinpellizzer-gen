    "intro": "Eugenia schaueriana, commonly known as the red cedar or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often red or yellow when ripe. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes. However, it can become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
