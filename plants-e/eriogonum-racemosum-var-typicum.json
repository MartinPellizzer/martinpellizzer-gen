    "intro": "Eriogonum racemosum var. typicum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
