It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry seasons. Eulophia speciosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
