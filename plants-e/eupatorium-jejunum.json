    "intro": "Eupatorium jejunum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical umbels, and are usually pinkish-white in color. Eupatorium jejunum is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
