    "intro": "Euphorbia divaricata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem with a zigzag appearance, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to minimize water loss. It produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. Euphorbia divaricata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance."
