    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 obtusiusculus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
