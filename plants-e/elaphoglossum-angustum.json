    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angustum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically divided into delicate, lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Elaphoglossum angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
