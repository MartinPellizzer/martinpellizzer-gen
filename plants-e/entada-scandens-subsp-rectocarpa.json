    "intro": "Entada scandens subsp. rectocarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a woody climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, featuring palmately compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. Its fruits are elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
