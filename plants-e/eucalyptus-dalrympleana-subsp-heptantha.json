    "intro": "Eucalyptus dalrympleana subsp. heptantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pink or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin strips, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
