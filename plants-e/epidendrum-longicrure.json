    "intro": "Epidendrum longicrure, commonly known as the long-legged epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers can range in color from white to pink and yellow, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
