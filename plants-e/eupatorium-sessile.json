    "intro": "Eupatorium sessile, commonly known as narrowleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
