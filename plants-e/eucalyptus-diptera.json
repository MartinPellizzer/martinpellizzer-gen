    "intro": "Eucalyptus diptera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pink or white, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Eucalyptus diptera is valued for its timber and has been used in various traditional and commercial applications."
