    "intro": "Epidendrum ravetianum, commonly known as the Crimson Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Epidendrum ravetianum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
