    "intro": "Eupatorium trifoliatum var. amoenum, commonly known as the fragrant blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a valuable addition to native gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
