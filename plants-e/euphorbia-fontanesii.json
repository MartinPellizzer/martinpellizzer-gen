    "intro": "Euphorbia fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontane's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival. Euphorbia fontanesii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens."
