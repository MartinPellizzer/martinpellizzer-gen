    "intro": "Erigeron amorphoglossus, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
