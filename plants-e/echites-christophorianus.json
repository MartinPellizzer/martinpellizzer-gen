    "intro": "Echites christophorianus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Echites christophorianus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals."
