    "intro": "Elymus caninus subsp. biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in two-flowered clusters, giving it its subspecies name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
