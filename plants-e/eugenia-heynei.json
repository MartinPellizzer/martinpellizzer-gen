    "intro": "Eugenia heynei, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia heynei is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
