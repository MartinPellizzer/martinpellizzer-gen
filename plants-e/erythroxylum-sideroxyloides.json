    "intro": "Erythroxylum sideroxyloides, commonly known as the ironwood coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude environments of the Andes. Due to its historical and cultural significance, it has been the subject of both botanical and ethnobotanical study."
