    "intro": "Euploca nana, commonly known as the dwarf euploca, is a small herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
