    "intro": "Elymus lanceolatus, commonly known as speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Elymus lanceolatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
