    "intro": "Erycibe terminaliflora, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive white or yellow center. The plant has a woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display. However, it can also be a host plant for the pink hibiscus mealybug, which is a common pest in tropical horticulture."
