It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. The fruit is edible, though the seeds are often toxic, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests."
