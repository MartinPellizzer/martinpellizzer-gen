    "intro": "Erica chartacea, commonly known as the coastal heath or dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica chartacea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
