    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. coccineus, commonly known as the red barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive reddish-pink coloration, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant features dense clusters of radial spines and produces showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are ribbed and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes. This species is adapted to hot, dry environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
