It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
