    "intro": "Ebelingia occidentalis, commonly known as the western ebelingia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ebelingia occidentalis is considered a species of conservation concern."
