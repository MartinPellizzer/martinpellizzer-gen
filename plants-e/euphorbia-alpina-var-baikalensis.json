    "intro": "Euphorbia alpina var. baikalensis, commonly known as the Baikal Spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and the Far East. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh climates."
