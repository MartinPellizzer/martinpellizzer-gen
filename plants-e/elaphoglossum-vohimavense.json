    "intro": "Elaphoglossum vohimavense, commonly known as the Vohimava holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum vohimavense is considered a conservation concern."
