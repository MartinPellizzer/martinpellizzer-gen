    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. tenue, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a species of horsetail that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in late summer. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it a common sight in marshes and along water edges. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
