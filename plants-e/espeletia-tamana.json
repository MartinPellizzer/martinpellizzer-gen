    "intro": "Espeletia tamana, commonly known as the Tamana heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette growth form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or volcanic soils, and is well-suited to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Espeletia tamana is an important component of the high-altitude ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability in its habitat."
