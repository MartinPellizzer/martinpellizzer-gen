    "intro": "Epidendrum parviexasperatum, commonly known as the miniature spurred orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant features compact, upright pseudobulbs with narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, with sepals and petals that are often brightly colored. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
