    "intro": "Erica pulchella var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, leathery leaves and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and hardiness. Erica pulchella var. pulchella plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
