    "intro": "Ephemerantha lonchophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
