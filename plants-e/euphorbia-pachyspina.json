    "intro": "Euphorbia pachyspina, commonly known as the thickspine euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
