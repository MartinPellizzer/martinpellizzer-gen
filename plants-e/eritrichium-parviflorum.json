    "intro": "Eritrichium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, delicate flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to high-altitude environments. Eritrichium parviflorum is often found in meadows and open slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
