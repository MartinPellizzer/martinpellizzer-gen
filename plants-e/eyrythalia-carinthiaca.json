    "intro": "Eyrythalia carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carinthian erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Eyrythalia carinthiaca is listed as endangered in several countries."
