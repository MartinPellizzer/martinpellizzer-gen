    "intro": "Eugenia glabrescens, commonly known as the glossy corymbia, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in corymbs, followed by edible, red, cherry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Eugenia glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
