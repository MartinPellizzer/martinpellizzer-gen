    "intro": "Enceliopsis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Enceliopsis species are characterized by their yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves adapted to conserve water. They often grow in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Enceliopsis californica and Enceliopsis palmeri, which are of interest to botanists and ecologists."
