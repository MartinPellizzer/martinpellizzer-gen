    "intro": "Eleusine indica, commonly known as false rice, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute and can be dispersed over long distances by wind or water. Eleusine indica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields."
