    "intro": "Elymus kronokensis subsp. dasyphyllus, commonly known as the roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, with lemmas that are typically rough and bristly to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
