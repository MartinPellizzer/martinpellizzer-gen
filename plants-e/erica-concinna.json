    "intro": "Erica concinna, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Erica concinna is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
