    "intro": "Ehretia indica, commonly known as Indian snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a delicate appearance. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Ehretia indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
