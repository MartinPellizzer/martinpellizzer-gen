    "intro": "Endopogon argutus, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant features small, green to blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pink or purple in color. Endopogon argutus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
