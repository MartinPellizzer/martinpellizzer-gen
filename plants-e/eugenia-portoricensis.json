    "intro": "Eugenia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican huito, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and botanical research."
