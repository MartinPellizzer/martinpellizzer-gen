    "intro": "Echinocactus candicans, commonly known as the sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Echinocactus candicans is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
