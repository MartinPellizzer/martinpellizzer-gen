    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender culms with spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
