    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Eriophorum russeolum."
