    "intro": "Euphorbia whellanii, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia whellanii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
