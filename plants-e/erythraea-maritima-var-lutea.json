It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to saline and arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a striking visual contrast against the green foliage. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and withstand harsh coastal conditions."
