    "intro": "Epiphyllum candidum, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is a climbing plant with thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night. Its stems are often used as a host for other plants, such as the hybrid cactus *Schlumbergera*, which is commonly sold as a potted plant. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
