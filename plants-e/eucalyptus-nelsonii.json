    "intro": "Eucalyptus nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's malleable gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and smooth, often peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and typically have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
