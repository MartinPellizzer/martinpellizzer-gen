    "intro": "Elymus virginicus f. australis, commonly known as the eastern wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which are often tinged with a reddish hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, prairies, and disturbed areas. This grass is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
