    "intro": "Eurystegia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly phyllodendron, is a tropical evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences, and it produces yellowish-orange fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
