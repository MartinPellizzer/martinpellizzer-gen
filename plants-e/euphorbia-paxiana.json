    "intro": "Euphorbia paxiana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive prolonged dry periods. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
