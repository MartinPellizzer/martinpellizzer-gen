It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense, low clusters. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with thick, fleshy roots, which help it survive in moist, shaded environments. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and the Himalayas. Elaphoglossum pachyrrhizum prefers humid, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade."
