    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides var. padifolia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are typically green or red and can branch out into a bushy form. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
