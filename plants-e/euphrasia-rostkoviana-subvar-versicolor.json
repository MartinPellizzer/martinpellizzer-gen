    "intro": "Euphrasia rostkoviana subvar. versicolor, commonly known as the variable eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, glandular-hairy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange and red, bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the undergrowth. The species is noted for its variability in flower color and leaf shape, making it a distinctive and ecologically valuable wildflower."
