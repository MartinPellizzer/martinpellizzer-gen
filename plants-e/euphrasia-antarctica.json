    "intro": "Euphrasia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic toothwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and the subantarctic regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and a slender stem that supports its inconspicuous blossoms. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and resilient species."
