    "intro": "Erigeron hyperboreus, commonly known as the Arctic blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant features a low-growing stem with narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in the summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, cold climates with limited nutrients. Erigeron hyperboreus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
