    "intro": "Eupatorium rostellatum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist soils along streams, swamps, and marshes, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs from late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium rostellatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
