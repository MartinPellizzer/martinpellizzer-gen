It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a leathery texture with a greyish-green color. It produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, spherical berries. The plant is adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a hardy species in arid regions."
