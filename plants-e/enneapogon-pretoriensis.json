    "intro": "Enneapogon pretoriensis, commonly known as the Pretoria grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry conditions. Enneapogon pretoriensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
