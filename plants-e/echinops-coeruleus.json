    "intro": "Echinops coeruleus, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spherical flower heads, which are composed of many tiny florets. The plant has silvery-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes. Echinops coeruleus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
