    "intro": "Euphorbia nakaii f. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves and produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant."
