    "intro": "Epidendrum brachychilum, commonly known as the short-lipped epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered with a fine layer of pubescence. Epidendrum brachychilum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
