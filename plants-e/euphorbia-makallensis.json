    "intro": "Euphorbia makallensis, commonly known as the Makallan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry environments. Euphorbia makallensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
