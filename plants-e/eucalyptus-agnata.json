    "intro": "Eucalyptus agnata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the winter months. Eucalyptus agnata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
