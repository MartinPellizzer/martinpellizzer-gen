    "intro": "Enekbatus longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled enekbatus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated stamens that can extend up to twice the length of the petals, making it visually distinctive. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Enekbatus longistylus is considered a vulnerable species."
