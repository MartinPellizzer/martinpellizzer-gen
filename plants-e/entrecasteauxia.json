    "intro": "Entrecasteauxia, commonly known as the \"gardenia of the south,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of only one species, Entrecasteauxia dentata, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
