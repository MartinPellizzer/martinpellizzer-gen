    "intro": "Euphorbia fruticulosa var. fruticulosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as \"tuna.\" It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance."
