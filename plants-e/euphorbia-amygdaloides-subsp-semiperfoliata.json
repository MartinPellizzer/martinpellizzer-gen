It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its foliage and unique floral structure make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
