    "intro": "Euphorbia subumbellata, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences resembling a cup. Euphorbia subumbellata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
