    "intro": "Epipactis renzii, commonly known as the Renzi's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Epipactis renzii is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its blooming period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a rare floral display to its natural habitat."
