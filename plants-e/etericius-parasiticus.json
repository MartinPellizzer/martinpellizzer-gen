    "intro": "Etericius parasiticus, commonly known as the ghostly mist vine, is a unique parasitic plant that derives its nutrients from host organisms. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for sustenance, often attaching itself to trees or shrubs. The plant's structure consists of slender, thread-like stems that can spread across the host's surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. Due to its specialized lifestyle, Etericius parasiticus is often found in shaded, humid environments where its host plants thrive."
