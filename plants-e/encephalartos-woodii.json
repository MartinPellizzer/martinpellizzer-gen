    "intro": "Encephalartos woodii, commonly known as the Wood's cycad, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces small, cone-like structures for reproduction. Due to its extreme rarity and lack of confirmed sightings since the early 20th century, it is considered possibly extinct in the wild. Conservation efforts remain focused on preserving any known specimens and understanding its ecological needs."
