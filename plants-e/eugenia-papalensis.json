    "intro": "Eugenia papalensis, commonly known as the Papal mountain eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Ecuador and northern Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
