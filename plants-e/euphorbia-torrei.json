    "intro": "Euphorbia torrei, commonly known as the Hawaiian euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is a common trait among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in coastal and dry woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
