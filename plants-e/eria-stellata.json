    "intro": "Eria stellata, commonly known as the star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eria stellata prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understorey of tropical forests. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
