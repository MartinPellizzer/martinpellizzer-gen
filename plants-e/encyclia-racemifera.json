It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in well-drained soil. Encyclia racemifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts worldwide."
