    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. simplex, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its simpler, less branched structure compared to other forms of Equisetum."
