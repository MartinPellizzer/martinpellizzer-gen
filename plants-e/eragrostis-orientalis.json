    "intro": "Eragrostis orientalis, commonly known as oriental lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
