It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
