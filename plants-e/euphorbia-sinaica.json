    "intro": "Euphorbia sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive yellow sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can store water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia sinaica is often found growing in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in low-nutrient environments."
