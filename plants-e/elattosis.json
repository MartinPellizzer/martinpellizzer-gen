    "intro": "Elattosis, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and the flowers range in color from yellow to orange. Elattosis species are often found in grassy areas and are adapted to dry conditions. They are also known for their ability to thrive in poor soils, making them resilient and widespread in their native habitats."
