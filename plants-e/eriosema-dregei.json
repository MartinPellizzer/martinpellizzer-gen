    "intro": "Eriosema dregei, commonly known as the Cape dandelion, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a hairy, upright stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads resembling dandelion puffs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a key botanical characteristic that distinguishes it from other similar species."
