    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei f. radicans, commonly known as creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
