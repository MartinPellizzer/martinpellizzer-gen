    "intro": "Ephedra distachya, commonly known as the two-stemmed ephedra, is a dioecious shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems that often appear woody and have a distinctive, branched structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Its leaves are scale-like and reduced, often absent except for a few at the base of the stems. Ephedra distachya is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its stems and tolerating extreme temperatures."
