    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia f. macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are often larger and more prominent than those of other equisetum species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its robust growth and historical use in traditional medicine."
