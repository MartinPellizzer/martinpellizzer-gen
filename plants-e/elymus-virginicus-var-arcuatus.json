    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. arcuatus, commonly known as the curved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often curved, giving it its scientific name. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
