    "intro": "Euphorbia thulinii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. Euphorbia thulinii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
