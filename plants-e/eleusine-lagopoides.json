    "intro": "Eleusine lagopoides, commonly known as the hare's foot grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted, hair-like leaves that resemble a hare's foot, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eleusine lagopoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
