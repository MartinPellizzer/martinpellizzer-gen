    "intro": "Eupatorium gibertii, commonly known as the creeping eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium gibertii is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
