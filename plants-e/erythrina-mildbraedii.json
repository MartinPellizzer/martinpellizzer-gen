    "intro": "Erythrina mildbraedii, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often fissured. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina mildbraedii is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening for its bold, showy display."
