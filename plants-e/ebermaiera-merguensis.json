    "intro": "Ebermaiera merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensian fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid tropical forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are bi-lobed and feature a unique pattern of veins, which aid in water retention in its moist, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ebermaiera merguensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
