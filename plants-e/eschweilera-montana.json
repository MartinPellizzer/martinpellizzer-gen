    "intro": "Eschweilera montana, commonly known as the mountain eschweilera, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eschweilera montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
