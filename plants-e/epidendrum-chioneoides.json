    "intro": "Epidendrum chioneoides, commonly known as the Snowy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity for optimal growth."
