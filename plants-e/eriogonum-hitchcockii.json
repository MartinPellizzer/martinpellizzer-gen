    "intro": "Eriogonum hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert and sagebrush environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum hitchcockii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in arid conditions."
