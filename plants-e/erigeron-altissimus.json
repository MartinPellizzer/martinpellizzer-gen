    "intro": "Erigeron altissimus, commonly known as the tall blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of up to six feet. Its blue to purple flower heads consist of both ray and disk flowers, with the central disk being yellow. Erigeron altissimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
