    "intro": "Ellisia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous ellisia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
