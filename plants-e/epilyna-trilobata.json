    "intro": "Epilyna trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed epilyna, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epilyna trilobata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
