    "intro": "Epidendrum sphaeranthum, commonly known as the globe orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Epidendrum sphaeranthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
