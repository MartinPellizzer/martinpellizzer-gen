    "intro": "Euphorbia calva, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia calva is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
