    "intro": "Erica parmentieri, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, shrubby appearance. Erica parmentieri is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
