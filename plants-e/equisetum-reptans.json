    "intro": "Equisetum reptans, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. Equisetum reptans is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plants on Earth."
