    "intro": "Eriocarpum grindelioides, commonly known as the coastal everlasting or coastal everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a low, spreading growth habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white, cotton-like seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation along sandy or coastal soils. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Eriocarpum grindelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
