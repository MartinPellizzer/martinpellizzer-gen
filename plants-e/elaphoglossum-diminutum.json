    "intro": "Elaphoglossum diminutum, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit, with rhizomes that help it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum diminutum is often found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in partial to full shade."
