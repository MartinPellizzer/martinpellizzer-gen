    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia f. microstachyum, commonly known as the miniature scouring rush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the typical species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along streams. This fern-like plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
