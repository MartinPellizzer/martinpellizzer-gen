    "intro": "Echinocereus stramineus subsp. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
