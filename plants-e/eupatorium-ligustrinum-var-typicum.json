    "intro": "Eupatorium ligustrinum var. typicum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
