    "intro": "Erysimum arenicola var. torulosum, commonly known as the coastal wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other Erysimum species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific habitat preferences."
