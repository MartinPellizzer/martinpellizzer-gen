    "intro": "Eragrostis kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kiwuensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
