    "intro": "Epigeneium macropodum, commonly known as the large-footed epigeneium, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spathe and spadix. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its botanical structure supports its role as an epiphyte, allowing it to grow on other plants without parasitizing them."
