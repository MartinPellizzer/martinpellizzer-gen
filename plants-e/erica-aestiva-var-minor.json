    "intro": "Erica aestiva var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing year-round interest. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
