    "intro": "Eugenia villosa, commonly known as the woolly eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by edible berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
