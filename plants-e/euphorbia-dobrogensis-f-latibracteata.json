    "intro": "Euphorbia dobrogensis f. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Dobruja region of Eastern Europe. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, thick, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its broader bracts surrounding the cyathia, giving it its specific epithet \"latibracteata.\""
