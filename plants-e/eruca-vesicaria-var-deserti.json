    "intro": "Eruca vesicaria var. deserti, commonly known as desert rocket, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, edible leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Desert rocket is sometimes cultivated as a leafy green vegetable in drought-tolerant gardens."
