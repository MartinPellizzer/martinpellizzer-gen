    "intro": "Epithema thomense, commonly known as the Thom's epiphyte, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white and pink. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Epithema thomense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
