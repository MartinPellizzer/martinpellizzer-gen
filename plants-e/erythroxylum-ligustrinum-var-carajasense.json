    "intro": "Erythroxylum ligustrinum var. carajasense, commonly known as the Caraj\u00e1s coca, is a species native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its potential alkaloid content, similar to other members of the Erythroxylum genus. This variant is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies due to its unique chemical profile."
