    "intro": "Epipremnum papuanum, commonly known as the laceleaf philodendron, is a climbing vine native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream patterns. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like philodendrons and monstera. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epipremnum papuanum is popular as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
