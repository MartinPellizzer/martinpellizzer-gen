The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia serrata is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
