    "intro": "Euphorbia subhastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments."
