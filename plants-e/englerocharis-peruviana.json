    "intro": "Englerocharis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Englerocharis peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
