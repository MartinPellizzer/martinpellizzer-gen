    "intro": "Elaphoglossum maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a compact, upright rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum maguirei is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
