    "intro": "Elaphrium fragile, commonly known as the brittle elaphrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has thin, fragile leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name and make it highly susceptible to environmental stress. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphrium fragile is considered a species of conservation concern."
