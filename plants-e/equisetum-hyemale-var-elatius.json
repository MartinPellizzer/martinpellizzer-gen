    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. elatius, commonly known as the tall scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for reproduction. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This variety is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
