    "intro": "Euonymus forbesianus, commonly known as the Forbes' euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and unique fruiting structures. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
