    "intro": "Erigeron strigosus var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in limestone habitats. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
