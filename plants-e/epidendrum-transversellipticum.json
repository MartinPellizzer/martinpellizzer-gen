    "intro": "Epidendrum transversellipticum, commonly known as the Transverse elliptic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
