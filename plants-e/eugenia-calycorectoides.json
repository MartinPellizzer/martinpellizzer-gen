    "intro": "Eugenia calycorectoides, commonly known as the red-veined eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
