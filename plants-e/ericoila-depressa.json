    "intro": "Ericoila depressa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, dense foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often reddish or dark green in color. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoila depressa is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
