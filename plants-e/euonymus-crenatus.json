    "intro": "Euonymus crenatus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Euonymus crenatus is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
