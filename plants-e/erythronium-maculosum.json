It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often speckled with white or yellow markings. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a showy, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale yellow with a green throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and delicate blooms."
