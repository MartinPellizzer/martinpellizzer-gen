It is native to Australia and is typically found in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Eriachne ovata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
