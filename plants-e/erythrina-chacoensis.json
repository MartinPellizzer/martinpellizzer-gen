    "intro": "Erythrina chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red floral bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated seed pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Erythrina chacoensis is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in savannas and dry forests."
