    "intro": "Echinopsis chionantha, commonly known as the White Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Echinopsis chionantha is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
