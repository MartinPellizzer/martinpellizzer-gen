    "intro": "Eulalia paniculata, commonly known as the panicled grass or everlasting grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that give it a decorative appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that mature into silky, white or pale brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Eulalia paniculata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry, open habitats."
