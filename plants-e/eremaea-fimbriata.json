    "intro": "Eremaea fimbriata, commonly known as the coastal eremaea, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, fimbriated (fringed) leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its root system is highly adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Eremaea fimbriata is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt lakes."
