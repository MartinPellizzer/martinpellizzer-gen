    "intro": "Eleocharis obtusetrigona, commonly known as the broad-angled sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Eleocharis obtusetrigona plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
