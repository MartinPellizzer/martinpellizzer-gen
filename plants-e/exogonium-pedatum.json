    "intro": "Exogonium pedatum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique plant characterized by its ability to propagate through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at intervals. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The botanical structure of Exogonium pedatum makes it an interesting subject for studying vegetative propagation in ferns."
