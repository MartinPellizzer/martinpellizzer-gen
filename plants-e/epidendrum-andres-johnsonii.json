    "intro": "Epidendrum andres-johnsonii, commonly known as the Andes Johnson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in cooler, drier conditions. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
