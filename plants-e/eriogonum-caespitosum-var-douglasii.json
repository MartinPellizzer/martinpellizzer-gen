    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas\u2019s wild buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as slopes and grasslands."
