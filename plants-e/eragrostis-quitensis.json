    "intro": "Eragrostis quitensis, commonly known as the Andean lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has adapted to cold, dry conditions with its deep root system. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Eragrostis quitensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
