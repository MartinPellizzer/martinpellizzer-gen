    "intro": "Ericoides tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed ericoid, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically needle-like in structure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Ericoides tenuicaule thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its botanical features make it a unique component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
