It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable environments."
