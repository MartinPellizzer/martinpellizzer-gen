    "intro": "Echinopsis arachnacantha subsp. torrecillasensis, commonly known as the Torrecillas echinopsis, is a columnar cactus native to Bolivia. It features a slender, ribbed stem with a smooth, pale green surface. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized cactus collections."
