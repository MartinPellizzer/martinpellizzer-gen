    "intro": "Eugenioides, commonly known as the satinwood or satinash, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Eugenioides species typically have small, simple leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and they are clustered in small inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
