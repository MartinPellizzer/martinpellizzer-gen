    "intro": "Elaphoglossum sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Elaphoglossum sprucei has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through underground stems. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
