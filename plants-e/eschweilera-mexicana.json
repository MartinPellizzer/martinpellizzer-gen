    "intro": "Eschweilera mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
