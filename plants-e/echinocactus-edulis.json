    "intro": "Echinocactus edulis, commonly known as the apple cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that produces large, fleshy fruits resembling apples, which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in traditional culinary practices by indigenous communities."
