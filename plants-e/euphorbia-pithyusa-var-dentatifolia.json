    "intro": "Euphorbia pithyusa var. dentatifolia, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by unique, bead-like seed pods. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
