It is a hybrid between Epilobium palustre and Epilobium hirsutum, characterized by its soft, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
