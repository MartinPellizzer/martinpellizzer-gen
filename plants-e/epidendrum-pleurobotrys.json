    "intro": "Epidendrum pleurobotrys, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pink or red with yellow lips, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
