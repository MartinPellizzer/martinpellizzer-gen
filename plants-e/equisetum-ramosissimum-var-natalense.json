It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a tall, sparsely leafy stem and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
