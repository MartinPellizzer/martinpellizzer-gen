    "intro": "Eupatorium gongorae, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped inflorescences that bloom in white or pink during the winter months. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its unique, almost otherworldly appearance. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its showy flowers. Eupatorium gongorae is adapted to the arid climate of Socotra, with features that help it conserve water and thrive in harsh conditions."
