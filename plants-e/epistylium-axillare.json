    "intro": "Epistylium axillare, commonly known as the axillary epistylium, is a colonial calcareous alga belonging to the order Rhodophyta. It forms dense, bush-like colonies that are typically found attached to hard surfaces in marine environments. The plant exhibits a complex structure with a central axis and numerous lateral branches, which support its photosynthetic function. Its thallus is composed of a gelatinous matrix containing calcium carbonate, providing structural support. Epistylium axillare plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to benthic habitat complexity and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
