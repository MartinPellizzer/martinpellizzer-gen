    "intro": "Eragrostis plumosa var. maritima, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a coastal grass species native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive, plume-like appearance. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing shorelines. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in arid or salty environments."
