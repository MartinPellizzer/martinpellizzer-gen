    "intro": "Epidendrum orientale, commonly known as the oriental epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its natural habitat. Epidendrum orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
