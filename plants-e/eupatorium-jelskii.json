    "intro": "Eupatorium jelskii, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
