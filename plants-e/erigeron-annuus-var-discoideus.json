    "intro": "Erigeron annuus var. discoideus, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are blue to purple in color, attracting various pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to the typical E. annuus."
