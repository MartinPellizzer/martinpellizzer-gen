    "intro": "Espeletia killipii var. killipii, commonly known as the Killip's espeletia, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white wax. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. The species is adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
