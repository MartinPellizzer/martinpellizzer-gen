    "intro": "Eccremocactus rosei, commonly known as the rose prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in soft, pale pink spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in drought conditions. This plant is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
