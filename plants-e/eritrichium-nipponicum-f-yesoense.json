    "intro": "Eritrichium nipponicum f. yesoense, commonly known as the Yeso sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This rare plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
