    "intro": "Euphorbia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-like euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Euphorbia nubigena is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
