    "intro": "Epidendrum tibicinis, commonly known as the Mexican Flame Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is a sympodial herb with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers with a contrasting yellow lip, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tibicinis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
