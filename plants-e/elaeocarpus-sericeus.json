    "intro": "Elaeocarpus sericeus, commonly known as the silky elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The silky elaeocarpus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
