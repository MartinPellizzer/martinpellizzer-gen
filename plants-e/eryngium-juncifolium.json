It features striking blue to purple spiny flower heads surrounded by white to pale blue bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Eryngium juncifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
