    "intro": "Euphrasia formosissima subsp. cucharensis, commonly known as the Cuchar\u00e1n's eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers with prominent yellow spots. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. It has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
