    "intro": "Eleocharis stolonifera, commonly known as the spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Eleocharis stolonifera plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
