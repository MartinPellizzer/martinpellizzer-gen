    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides subsp. major, commonly known as the giant desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. This species is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
