    "intro": "Euphorbia nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
