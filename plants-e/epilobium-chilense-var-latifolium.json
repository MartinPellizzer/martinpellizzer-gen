    "intro": "Epilobium chilense var. latifolium, commonly known as the Chilean willow herb, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wet soils and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
