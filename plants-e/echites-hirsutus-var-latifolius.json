    "intro": "Echites hirsutus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf echites, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that further aids in moisture retention. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
