    "intro": "Echinocactus quehlianus, commonly known as the Mexican golden lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to the rocky soils of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that grow in a bushy, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
