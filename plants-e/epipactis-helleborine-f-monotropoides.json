    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. monotropoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often not fully developed. It is found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks across Europe and parts of Asia. This orchid is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Epipactis species, leading to genetic diversity within the genus."
