    "intro": "Elephantopus carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina elephant's foot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, tuberous roots that resemble an elephant's foot, which store water and nutrients. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
