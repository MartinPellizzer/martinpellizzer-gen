    "intro": "Eugenia fiscalensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Ceraseiro*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, red, edible drupe, similar in appearance to a cherry, which is often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Eugenia fiscalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
