    "intro": "Epiphorella geniculata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds, which gives it an elegant and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Epiphorella geniculata is often considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
