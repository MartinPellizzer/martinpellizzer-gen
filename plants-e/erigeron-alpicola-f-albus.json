    "intro": "Erigeron alpicola f. albus, commonly known as the white alpine fleabane, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
