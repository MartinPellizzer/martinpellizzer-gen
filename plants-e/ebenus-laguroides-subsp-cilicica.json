    "intro": "Ebenus laguroides subsp. cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician euphrasia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, often yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing a preference for well-drained soils. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from host plants while still performing photosynthesis. Its distribution includes parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon, where it thrives in specific ecological niches."
