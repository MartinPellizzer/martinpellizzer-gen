    "intro": "Euphorbia parryi, commonly known as Parry's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia parryi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
