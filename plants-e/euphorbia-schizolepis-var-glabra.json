    "intro": "Euphorbia schizolepis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are smooth and often tinged with green or reddish hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, surrounded by green bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for arid environments."
