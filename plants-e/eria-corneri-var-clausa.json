It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on the forest floor. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
