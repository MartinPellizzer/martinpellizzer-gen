    "intro": "Encheiridion sanfordii, commonly known as the Sanford's encheiridion, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wetland habitats. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
