    "intro": "Eriopha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to purple. Eriopha species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including disturbed soils and wetlands. They are sometimes considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse environments."
