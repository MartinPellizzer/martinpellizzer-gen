    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus var. maritima, commonly known as sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation if handled without protection."
