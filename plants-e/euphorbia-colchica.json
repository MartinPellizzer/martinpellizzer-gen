    "intro": "Euphorbia colchica, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Euphorbia colchica is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
