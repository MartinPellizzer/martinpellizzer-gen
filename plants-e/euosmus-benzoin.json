    "intro": "Euosmus benzoin, commonly known as benjamin's tree or styrax benzoin, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by aromatic, sticky resinous exudates used in perfumes and traditional medicine. Its resin, known as benjamin, is valued for its balsamic scent and therapeutic properties. Euosmus benzoin thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
