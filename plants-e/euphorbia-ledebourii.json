    "intro": "Euphorbia ledebourii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia ledebourii is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
