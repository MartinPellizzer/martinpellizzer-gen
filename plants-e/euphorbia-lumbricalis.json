    "intro": "Euphorbia lumbricalis, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study."
