    "intro": "Elatostema brachyodontum subsp. lengshuiheensis, commonly known as the Lengshuihe stamenplant, is a rare member of the Urticaceae family native to China. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive stamen arrangement. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with features that aid in pollination and resource conservation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
