It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
