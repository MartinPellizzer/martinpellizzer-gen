    "intro": "Eriogonum ochrocephalum var. agnellum, commonly known as the desert galleta, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
