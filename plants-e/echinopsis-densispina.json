    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is a solitary, columnar cactus characterized by its dense covering of spines and a ribbed stem. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
