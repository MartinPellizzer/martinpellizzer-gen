    "intro": "Eucharis plicata subsp. brevidentata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and ease of care."
