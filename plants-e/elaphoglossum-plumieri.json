    "intro": "Elaphoglossum plumieri, commonly known as the plumier's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. Elaphoglossum plumieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
