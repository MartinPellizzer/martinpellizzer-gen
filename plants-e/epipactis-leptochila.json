    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and is often found in association with specific fungal mycorrhizae. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its specialized symbiotic relationships."
