    "intro": "Elymus glaucissimus, commonly known as blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green blades that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Elymus glaucissimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
