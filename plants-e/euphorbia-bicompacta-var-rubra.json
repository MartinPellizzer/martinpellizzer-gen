It features compact, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
