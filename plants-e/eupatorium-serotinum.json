    "intro": "Eupatorium serotinum, commonly known as late boneset, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in composite heads, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its name \"serotinum\" refers to its late flowering period, which occurs after many other plants have finished blooming."
