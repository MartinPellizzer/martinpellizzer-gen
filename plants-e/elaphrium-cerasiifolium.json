    "intro": "Elaphrium cerasiifolium, commonly known as the cherryleaf elaphrium, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, resembling the shape of a cherry leaf. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded understories."
