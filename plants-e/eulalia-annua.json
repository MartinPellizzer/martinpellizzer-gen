It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clumps at the base. Eulalia annua thrives in moist or aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
