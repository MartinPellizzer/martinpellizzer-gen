    "intro": "Ecbolium moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ecbolium moritzianum is considered a vulnerable species."
