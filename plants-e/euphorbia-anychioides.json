    "intro": "Euphorbia anychioides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia anychioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
