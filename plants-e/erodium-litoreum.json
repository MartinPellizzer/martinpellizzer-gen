    "intro": "Erodium litoreum, commonly known as the beach erodium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Erodium litoreum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
