    "intro": "Euonymus proteus, commonly known as the variegated spurge or the winter creeper, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Euonymus proteus thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its foliage changes color with the seasons, offering visual interest throughout the year."
