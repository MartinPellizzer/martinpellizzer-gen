    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris, commonly known as marsh clubmoss, is a sedge species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological structure of wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis palustris plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
