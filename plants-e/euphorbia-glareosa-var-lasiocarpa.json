    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. The silky hairs on its stems provide protection against intense sunlight and water loss."
