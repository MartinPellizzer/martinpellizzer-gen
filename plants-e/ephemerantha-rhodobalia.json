    "intro": "Ephemerantha rhodobalia, commonly known as the crimson flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and unique, intricate floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its short blooming period, typically during the late spring, makes it a sought-after specimen among botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
