    "intro": "Eulophia epidendroides, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers are typically borne on inflorescences and are characterized by their intricate, fragrant structures. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to humid, shaded environments and its role in ecological diversity within its native habitats."
