    "intro": "Eriogonum flavum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, typically growing in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, globular seed pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots to access water. Eriogonum flavum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid regions."
