    "intro": "Epimedium macranthum f. roseum, commonly known as the roseum variety of barrenwort, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its vibrant pink to red foliage. This fern-like perennial thrives in shady, moist environments and is native to the mountainous regions of China. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often display a striking coloration that enhances garden landscapes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are less showy than its foliage. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to woodland gardens."
