    "intro": "Eucalyptus brownii, commonly known as the Brown's gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a medium to tall tree, typically reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a spreading crown. The bark is smooth and often grey or brown in color, peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and have a distinctive bluish-green hue. The flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that release small, ellipsoid seeds."
