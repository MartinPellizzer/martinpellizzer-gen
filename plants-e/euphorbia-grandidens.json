    "intro": "Euphorbia grandidens, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble candles, which store water to help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Euphorbia grandidens is valued for its unique appearance and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
