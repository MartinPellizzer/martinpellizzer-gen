It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically yellow or cream in color, which appear in clusters along the branches. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern of white and grey. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
