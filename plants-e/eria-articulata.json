    "intro": "Eria articulata, commonly known as the jointed eria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Eria articulata is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its unique morphology, including its jointed stems, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
