    "intro": "Epigeneium banghamii, commonly known as the Bangham's slipper orchid, is a unique tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a specialized structure used to trap insects for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
