    "intro": "Evolvulus incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Evolvulus incanus is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
