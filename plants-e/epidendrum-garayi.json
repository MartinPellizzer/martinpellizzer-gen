    "intro": "Epidendrum garayi, commonly known as the Garay's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum garayi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
