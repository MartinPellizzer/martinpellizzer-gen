    "intro": "Erica sparsa var. glandulosopedicellata, commonly known as the glandular-leaved heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
