    "intro": "Eupatorium kleinioides var. typicum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in swampy areas, thriving in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs from late summer into early fall. Swamp boneset is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
