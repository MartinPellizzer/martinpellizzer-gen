    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gossypinum, commonly known as the cottony holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, cotton-like layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study in plant morphology and ecology."
