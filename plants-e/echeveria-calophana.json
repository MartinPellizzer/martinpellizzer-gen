    "intro": "Echeveria calophana, commonly known as the Silver Chalice Echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
