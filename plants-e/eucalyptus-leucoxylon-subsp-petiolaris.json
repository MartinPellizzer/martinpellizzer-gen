    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon subsp. petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color and have a leathery texture. The flowers are typically white or pale blue and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The bark is smooth and ranges from grey to white, often peeling in thin, flaky sheets. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant in dry landscapes."
