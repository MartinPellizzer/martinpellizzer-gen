    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
