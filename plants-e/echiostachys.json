    "intro": "Echiostachys, commonly known as the woolly bluestem, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves. The plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Echiostachys species are often used in restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually blue or purple in color."
