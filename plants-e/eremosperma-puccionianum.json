    "intro": "Eremosperma puccionianum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in harsh environments."
