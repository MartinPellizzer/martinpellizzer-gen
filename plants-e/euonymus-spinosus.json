    "intro": "Euonymus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Euonymus spinosus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
