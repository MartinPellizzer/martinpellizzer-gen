These plants are characterized by their distinctive, showy flowers that often resemble small tulips, with bright colors such as white, yellow, or orange. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Erythronium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. They thrive in woodland or meadow habitats and are often found growing in moist, well-drained soils."
