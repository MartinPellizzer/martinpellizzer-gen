    "intro": "Ervum hugeri, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped leaflet and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. The pods are typically slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
