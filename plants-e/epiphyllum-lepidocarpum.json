    "intro": "Epiphyllum lepidocarpum, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is a climbing or trailing plant with fleshy, green stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically pink, white, or red, opening at night and closing by dawn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive flowers and unique growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
