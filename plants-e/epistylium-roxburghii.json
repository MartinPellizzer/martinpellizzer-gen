    "intro": "Epistylium roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian water flea, is a colonial aquatic plant belonging to the family Rhizopodaceae. It forms dense, floating mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, often in slow-moving or still waters. The plant consists of a central stalk with numerous zooids that bear flagellated cells for locomotion. Its structure allows it to thrive in nutrient-rich environments, contributing to water clarity by filtering suspended particles. Epistylium roxburghii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for larger organisms."
