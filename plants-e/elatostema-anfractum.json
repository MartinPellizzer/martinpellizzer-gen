    "intro": "Elatostema anfractum, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a herbaceous species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a rough texture and sometimes hairy surfaces. Elatostema anfractum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique growth habit and adaptability to various soil conditions."
