It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
