It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glandular surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads. Eupatorium resinosum is known for its sticky resinous secretions, which give it its common name."
