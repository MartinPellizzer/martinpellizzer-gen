    "intro": "Eupatorium reyrobinsonii, commonly known as Robinsont's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant has serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
