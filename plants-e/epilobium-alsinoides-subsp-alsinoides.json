    "intro": "Epilobium alsinoides subsp. alsinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as stream banks, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its showy, pink to purple flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and bloom in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
