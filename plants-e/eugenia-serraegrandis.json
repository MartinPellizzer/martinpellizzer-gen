It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often deeply veined and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
