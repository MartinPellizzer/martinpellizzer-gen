    "intro": "Evonymoides buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf euonym, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its foliage and fruit make it an attractive addition to gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions. The species is closely related to other members of the Euonymus genus, sharing similar botanical characteristics."
