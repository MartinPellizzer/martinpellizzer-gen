    "intro": "Epidendrum confertum, commonly known as the clustered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum confertum is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
