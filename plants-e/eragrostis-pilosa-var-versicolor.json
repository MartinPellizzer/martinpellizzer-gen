    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. versicolor, commonly known as variable hairy grama, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or red, giving it its variable coloration. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
