    "intro": "Echinopsis orurensis, commonly known as the Pachypodium cuneiformis, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a single stem that may branch out over time. Echinopsis orurensis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
