    "intro": "Eucarya spicata, commonly known as the spiky eucarya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are typically green or purple in color. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Eucarya spicata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
