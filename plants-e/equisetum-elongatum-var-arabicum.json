It is characterized by its segmented, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typical of its ancient evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to harsh environments."
