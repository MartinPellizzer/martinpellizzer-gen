    "intro": "Euterpe jatapuensis, commonly known as the Jatapu palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil. It is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to other palm fruits. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
