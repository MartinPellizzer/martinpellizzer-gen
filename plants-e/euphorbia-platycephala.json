    "intro": "Euphorbia platycephala, commonly known as the flat-headed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Euphorbia platycephala is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
