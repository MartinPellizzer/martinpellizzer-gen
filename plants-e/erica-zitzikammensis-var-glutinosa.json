    "intro": "Erica zitzikammensis var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that exude a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
