    "intro": "Epipactis cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, closed (cleistogamous) flowers that do not open, a reproductive strategy that ensures self-pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it lacks the typical orchid fragrance. Epipactis cleistogama is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates."
