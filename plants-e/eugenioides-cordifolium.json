It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, reddish berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
