    "intro": "Euphorbia uralensis, commonly known as the Ural spurge, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Russia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, milky sap that is toxic to both humans and animals. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure. Euphorbia uralensis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine or steppe environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
