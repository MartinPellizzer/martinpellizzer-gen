    "intro": "Elaeagnus tifliensis, commonly known as the Turk's cap buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Elaeagnus tifliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
