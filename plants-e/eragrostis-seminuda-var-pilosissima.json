    "intro": "Eragrostis seminuda var. pilosissima, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a soft, silky texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
