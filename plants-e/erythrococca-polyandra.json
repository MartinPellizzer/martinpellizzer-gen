    "intro": "Erythrococca polyandra, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones being particularly striking due to their red coloration. Native to Madagascar, it thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
