    "intro": "Emex australis, commonly known as the Australian burr or the thorned burr, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Emex australis produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that brush against the spiny burrs, aiding in its spread across the landscape."
