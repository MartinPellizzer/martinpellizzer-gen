    "intro": "Elymus arizonicus, commonly known as Arizona needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous awned florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Elymus arizonicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
