It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge above the water surface. Echinodorus lanceolatus thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality."
