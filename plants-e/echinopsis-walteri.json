    "intro": "Echinopsis walteri, commonly known as the Walter's moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, specifically Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and vibrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are often a striking shade of yellow or orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis walteri is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
