    "intro": "Ehretia glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a silvery-blue appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ehretia glaucescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
