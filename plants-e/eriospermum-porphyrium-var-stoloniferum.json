    "intro": "Eriospermum porphyrium var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the purple eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically a mix of green and purple hues. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its unique coloration and growth habit make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens."
