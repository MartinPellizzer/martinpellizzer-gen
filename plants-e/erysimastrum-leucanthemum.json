It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
