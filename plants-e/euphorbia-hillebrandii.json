    "intro": "Euphorbia hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in dry, well-drained soils."
