It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by white to pinkish ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. Its foliage is usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
