    "intro": "Ericoides niveum, commonly known as the snow heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Ericoides niveum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
