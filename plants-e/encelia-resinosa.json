    "intro": "Encelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are covered in a sticky, resinous substance that gives it its common name. Encelia resinosa is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
