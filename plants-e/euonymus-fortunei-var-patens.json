    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. patens, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and adaptability. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its year-round aesthetic appeal."
