    "intro": "Erica arctica, commonly known as the Arctic heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Erica arctica plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is a symbol of resilience in cold climates."
