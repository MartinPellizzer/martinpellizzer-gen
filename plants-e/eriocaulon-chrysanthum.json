It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish flowers. This plant is typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
