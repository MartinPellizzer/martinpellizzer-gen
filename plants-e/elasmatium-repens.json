    "intro": "Elasmatium repens, commonly known as the creeping elasmatium, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Elatostomataceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and delicate, overlapping leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood in temperate regions. Elasmatium repens plays a minor role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
