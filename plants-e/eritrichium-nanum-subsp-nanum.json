It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
