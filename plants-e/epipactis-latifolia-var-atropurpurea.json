    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking purple to violet flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
