    "intro": "Elaeodendron humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's elaeodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elongated leaves that have a leathery texture and a deep green color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Elaeodendron humbertii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
