It belongs to the Elatinaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common species in temperate regions. Elatine rotundifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms."
