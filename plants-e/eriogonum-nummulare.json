It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum nummulare plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
