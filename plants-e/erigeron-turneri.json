    "intro": "Erigeron turneri, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. It has small, alternate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erigeron turneri is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides."
