    "intro": "Erica fabrilis, commonly known as the Heath or Common Heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. Erica fabrilis plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
