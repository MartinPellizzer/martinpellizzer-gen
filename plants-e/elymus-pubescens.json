    "intro": "Elymus pubescens, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often grow in dense tufts, with leaves that are hairy and narrow. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green or reddish, containing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
