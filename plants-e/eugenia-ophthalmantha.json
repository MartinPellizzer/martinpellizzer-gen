    "intro": "Eugenia ophthalmantha, commonly known as the red-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in the summer months. These flowers give way to small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Eugenia ophthalmantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
