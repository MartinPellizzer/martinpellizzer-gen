    "intro": "Euphorbia inundata var. garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
