    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, toothed leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
