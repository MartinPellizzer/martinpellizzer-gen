    "intro": "Epilobium anagallidifolium var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
