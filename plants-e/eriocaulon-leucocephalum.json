    "intro": "Eriocaulon leucocephalum, commonly known as the white-headed spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often contributing to soil stabilization. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in wetland restoration projects."
