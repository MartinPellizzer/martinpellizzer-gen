    "intro": "Endotropis crocea subsp. insula, commonly known as the island endotropis, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain tropical islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically glabrous. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with five petals and a distinctive, tubular corolla. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
