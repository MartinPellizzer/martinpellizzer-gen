    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and hairy leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, inflated fruits that split to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The hairy woodbine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
