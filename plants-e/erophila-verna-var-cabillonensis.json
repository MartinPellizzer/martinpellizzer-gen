    "intro": "Erophila verna var. cabillonensis, commonly known as the Philippine white geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually prostrate or trailing. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value."
