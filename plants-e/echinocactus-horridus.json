    "intro": "Echinocactus horridus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration."
