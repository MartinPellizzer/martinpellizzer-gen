    "intro": "Eriachne triodioides var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil fertility. This variety is often found in coastal and inland sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
