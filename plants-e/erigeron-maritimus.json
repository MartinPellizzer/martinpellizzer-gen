    "intro": "Erigeron maritimus, commonly known as sea lettuce or maritime fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in tidal zones. Erigeron maritimus is an important plant in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
