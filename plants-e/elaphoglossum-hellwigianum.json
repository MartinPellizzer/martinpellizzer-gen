It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, typical of the genus Elaphoglossum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
