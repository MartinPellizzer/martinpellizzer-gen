    "intro": "Eremophila dielsiana, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal dunes. Eremophila dielsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional bush medicine by Indigenous Australians."
