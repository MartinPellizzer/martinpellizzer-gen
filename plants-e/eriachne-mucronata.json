It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 1 meter tall, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.
