    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 dycei, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile plant that results from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and the presence of whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant retains the typical features of horsetails, including the production of spore-bearing structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
