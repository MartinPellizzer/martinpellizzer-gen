It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of desert flora."
