    "intro": "Ephedra nebrodensis var. procera, commonly known as the tall ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the stems, reducing water loss in its dry environment. Ephedra nebrodensis var. procera is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
