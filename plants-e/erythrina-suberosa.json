    "intro": "Erythrina suberosa, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of leaflets, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and corky, providing structural support and resistance to environmental stress. Erythrina suberosa is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules."
