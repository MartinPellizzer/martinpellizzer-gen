    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. simulans, commonly known as the false mallow, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
