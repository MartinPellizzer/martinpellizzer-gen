    "intro": "Euryandra, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its small, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Euryandra species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations make them an important part of their native ecosystems."
