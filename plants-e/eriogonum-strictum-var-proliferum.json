    "intro": "Eriogonum strictum var. proliferum, commonly known as the sticky leaf buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name and help deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid habitats. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
