    "intro": "Epidendrum vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in disturbed or volcanic landscapes. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It is a pseudobulbous species, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Epidendrum vulcanicola is often found growing in shaded, humid environments near lava flows or in rocky areas."
