    "intro": "Echinops neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its genus name \"Echinops,\" which means \"spiny head.\" The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive spiky seed heads. Echinops neumannii is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
