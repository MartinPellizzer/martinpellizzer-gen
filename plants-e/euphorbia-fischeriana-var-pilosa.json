    "intro": "Euphorbia fischeriana var. pilosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in low-maintenance landscaping."
