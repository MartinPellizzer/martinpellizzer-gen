    "intro": "Echinopsis backebergii, commonly known as the Backeberg cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
