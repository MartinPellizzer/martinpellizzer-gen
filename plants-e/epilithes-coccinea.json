    "intro": "Epilithes coccinea, commonly known as the red rock fern, is a strikingly colored epiphytic plant that thrives on rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its vibrant red fronds, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant's roots are adapted to anchor it to rocky substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Epilithes coccinea typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas. Its unique appearance and specialized growth habits make it a notable species in botanical studies."
