    "intro": "Elegia tectorum, commonly known as the common wall rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. Elegia tectorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
