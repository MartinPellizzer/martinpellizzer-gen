    "intro": "Epidendrum platyclinium, commonly known as the flat-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often a vibrant green, providing a striking visual contrast to its flowering spikes. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Epidendrum platyclinium is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
