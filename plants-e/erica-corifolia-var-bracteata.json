    "intro": "Erica corifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the winter months. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, showing resilience to coastal winds and salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
