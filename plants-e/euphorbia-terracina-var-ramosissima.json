It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
