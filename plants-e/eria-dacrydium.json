    "intro": "Eria dacrydium, commonly known as the New Zealand tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody cones containing seeds. It is well adapted to the temperate and subalpine environments of New Zealand, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, Eria dacrydium is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
