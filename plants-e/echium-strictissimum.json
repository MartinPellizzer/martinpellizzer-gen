    "intro": "Echium strictissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bracts that resemble leaves, which are often mistaken for true foliage. Its stems are typically covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Echium strictissimum is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
