    "intro": "Eustrephus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a bell-shaped structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
