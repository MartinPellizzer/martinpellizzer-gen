    "intro": "Echinodiscus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny disc coral, is a species of calcareous algae that forms a bushy, branching structure. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny, calcified plates that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in shallow marine environments, where it attaches to rocky substrates. The algae's calcified skeleton provides structural support and protection against herbivory. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to reef formation and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
