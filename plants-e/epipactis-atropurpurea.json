    "intro": "Epipactis atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of dark purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
