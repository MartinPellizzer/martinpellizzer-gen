    "intro": "Eriocaulon cherrapunjianum, commonly known as the Cherrapunji spike-rush, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the northeastern region of India, particularly in the Cherrapunji area. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high rainfall. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the humid and cool climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
