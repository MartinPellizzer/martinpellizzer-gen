    "intro": "Euphorbia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are inconspicuous, with a unique structure that includes a cyathium, a cup-like arrangement of modified leaves and flowers."
