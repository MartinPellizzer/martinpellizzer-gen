    "intro": "Elmerrillia tsiampacca subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved elmerrillia, is a lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
