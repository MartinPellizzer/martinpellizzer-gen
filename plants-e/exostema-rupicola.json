It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual means. Exostema rupicola is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
