    "intro": "Encyclia inaguensis, commonly known as the Inagua orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Bahamas. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically featuring a white or pale pink lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
