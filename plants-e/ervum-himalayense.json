    "intro": "Ervum himalayense, commonly known as the Himalayan vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Ervum himalayense plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
