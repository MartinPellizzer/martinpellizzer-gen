    "intro": "Euphorbia evansii, commonly known as the Evans' spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with green or red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
