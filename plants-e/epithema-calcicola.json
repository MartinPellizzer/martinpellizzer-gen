    "intro": "Epithema calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola epithema, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcium-rich environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in alpine or arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. Epithema calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
