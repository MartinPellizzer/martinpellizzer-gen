    "intro": "Engelhardia spicata var. aceriflora, commonly known as the maple-leafed ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are alternate, ovate, and often have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
