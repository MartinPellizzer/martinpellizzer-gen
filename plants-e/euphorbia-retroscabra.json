    "intro": "Euphorbia retroscabra, commonly known as the backward-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular choice for xerophytic gardens. Euphorbia retroscabra is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
