    "intro": "Euphorbia lucorum var. simplicior, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a low-growing, compact form with fleshy, greenish-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings."
