    "intro": "Epilobium nummulariifolium var. caespitosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or mossy willow, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and forest edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
