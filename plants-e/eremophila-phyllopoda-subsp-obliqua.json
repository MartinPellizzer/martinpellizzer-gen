    "intro": "Eremophila phyllopoda subsp. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in winter and spring. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species for landscaping in dry climates. Eremophila phyllopoda subsp. obliqua is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
