    "intro": "Electra mutica var. multiligulata, commonly known as the multiligulate rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often greenish or brownish in color. This variety is distinguished by its multiple ligules, which are the small bracts at the base of each flower, contributing to its scientific name."
