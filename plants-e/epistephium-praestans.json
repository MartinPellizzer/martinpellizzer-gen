    "intro": "Epistephium praestans, commonly known as the showy epistephium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Epistephium praestans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
