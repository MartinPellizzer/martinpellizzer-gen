    "intro": "Eriogonum kennedyi var. alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in high-elevation environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is part of the widespread Eriogonum genus, which is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils."
