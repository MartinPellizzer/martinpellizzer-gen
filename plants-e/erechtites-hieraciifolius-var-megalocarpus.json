    "intro": "Erechtites hieraciifolius var. megalocarpus, commonly known as the giant swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetlands in North America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its stems are usually hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, making it a striking presence in moist environments. This variant is notable for its larger, more robust seeds compared to other varieties of the species."
