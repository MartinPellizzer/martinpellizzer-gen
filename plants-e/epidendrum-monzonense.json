    "intro": "Epidendrum monzonense, commonly known as the Mexican flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that are often adorned with contrasting yellow markings. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, and often dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
