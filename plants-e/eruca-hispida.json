    "intro": "Eruca hispida, commonly known as prickly mustard, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and often covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Eruca hispida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
