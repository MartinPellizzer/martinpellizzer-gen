    "intro": "Erigeron cilicicus, commonly known as the Cyprus fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and grasslands. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
