    "intro": "Erigeron rutilus, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a grayish-green color that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
