    "intro": "Euphorbia densiuscula, commonly known as the dense-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, green, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia densiuscula is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
