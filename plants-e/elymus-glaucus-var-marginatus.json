    "intro": "Elymus glaucus var. marginatus, commonly known as the silvergrass or bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers."
