    "intro": "Eriogonum trichopes subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
