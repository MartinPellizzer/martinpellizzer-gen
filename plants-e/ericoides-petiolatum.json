It features small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Ericoides petiolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
