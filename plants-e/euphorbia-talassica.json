    "intro": "Euphorbia talassica, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it produces a milky latex when damaged. Euphorbia talassica is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy shores, where it thrives in full sun."
