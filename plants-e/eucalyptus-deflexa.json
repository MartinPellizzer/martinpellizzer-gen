    "intro": "Eucalyptus deflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malleeflower, is a small shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves that are often twisted or rolled. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mallee and heathland ecosystems. Eucalyptus deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
