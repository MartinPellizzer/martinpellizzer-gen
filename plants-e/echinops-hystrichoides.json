    "intro": "Echinops hystrichoides, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny seed heads that resemble a globular shape, which are produced after the plant has matured. The plant has silver-gray foliage with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops hystrichoides is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
