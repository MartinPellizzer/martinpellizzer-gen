    "intro": "Elytrigia angularis, commonly known as angular bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Elytrigia angularis is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in ornamental gardening."
