    "intro": "Eleocharis retroflexa subsp. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of spikelets that bear tiny, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form a network that helps stabilize the soil and support its growth in aquatic conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and birds."
