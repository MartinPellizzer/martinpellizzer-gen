    "intro": "Euphorbia schleinitzii, commonly known as the Schleinitz's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically borne in late summer, and the plant is known for its resilience in harsh, dry conditions. Euphorbia schleinitzii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
