It features erect, branched stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
