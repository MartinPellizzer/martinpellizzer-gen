    "intro": "Euphorbia campestris var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
