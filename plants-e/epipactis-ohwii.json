    "intro": "Epipactis ohwii, commonly known as the Japanese helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis ohwii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
