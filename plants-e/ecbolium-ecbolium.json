    "intro": "Ecbolium ecbolium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by spherical, green berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
