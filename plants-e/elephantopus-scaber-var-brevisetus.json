    "intro": "Elephantopus scaber var. brevisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elephantopus, is a variant of the elephantopus scaber species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its leaves are often rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff, short hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
