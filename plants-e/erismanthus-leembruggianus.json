    "intro": "Erismanthus leembruggianus, commonly known as the Bornean erismanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Erismanthus leembruggianus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
