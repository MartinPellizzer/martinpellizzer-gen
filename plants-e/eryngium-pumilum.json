    "intro": "Eryngium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features gray-green, spiny leaves and produces small, blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodland or grassland environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens. Eryngium pumilum is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance."
