    "intro": "Echidnopsis socotrana, commonly known as Socotra starfish, is a unique flowering plant native to the Arabian island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that resemble a starfish. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat, showing adaptations to the harsh conditions of the Socotra archipelago. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
