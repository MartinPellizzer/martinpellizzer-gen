    "intro": "Exostegia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care."
