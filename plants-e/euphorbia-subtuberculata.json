    "intro": "Euphorbia subtuberculata, commonly known as the smooth-tubercled spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has a distinctive growth habit with a basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are covered in tiny, raised bumps called tubercles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia subtuberculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
