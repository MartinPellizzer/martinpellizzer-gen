    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. cuphosperma, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with a caudex, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as an ornamental plant."
