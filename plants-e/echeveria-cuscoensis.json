    "intro": "Echeveria cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco echeveria, is a succulent native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray to green in color. The plant produces clusters of violet or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
