    "intro": "Epidendrum lyratum, commonly known as the Lyre Leaf Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lyre-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and white. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum lyratum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
