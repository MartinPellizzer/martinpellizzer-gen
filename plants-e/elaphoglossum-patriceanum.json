    "intro": "Elaphoglossum patriceanum, commonly known as the Patrice's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
