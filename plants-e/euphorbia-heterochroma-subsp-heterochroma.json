    "intro": "Euphorbia heterochroma subsp. heterochroma, commonly known as the purple milkweed tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that range from green to reddish-purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
