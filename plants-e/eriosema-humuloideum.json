    "intro": "Eriosema humuloideum, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its overall hairy texture. Eriosema humuloideum is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
