    "intro": "Euphorbia horrida var. striata, commonly known as the striped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The leaves are typically narrow and may have a slight bluish tint, while the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
