    "intro": "Erythroxylum cuneatum, commonly known as the purple coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces elliptical berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds covered in a sticky substance. It is part of the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids. However, it is not as well-known or cultivated as other species in the Erythroxylum genus."
