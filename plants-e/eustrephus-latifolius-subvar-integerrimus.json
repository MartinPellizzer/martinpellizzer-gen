It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust foliage and slightly larger leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
