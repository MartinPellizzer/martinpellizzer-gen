    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. villifolius, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, spherical berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in woodland gardens."
