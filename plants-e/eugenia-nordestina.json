    "intro": "Eugenia nordestina, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *cereja-do-norte*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the northeastern regions of Brazil and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are not related to true cherries. Eugenia nordestina thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in local markets."
