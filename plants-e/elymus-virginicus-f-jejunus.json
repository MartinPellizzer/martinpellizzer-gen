    "intro": "Elymus virginicus f. jejunus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other riparian habitats. Due to its delicate structure and preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
