    "intro": "Eucalyptus lucasii, commonly known as the Lucas's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically in winter or early spring. This species is adapted to low rainfall and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
