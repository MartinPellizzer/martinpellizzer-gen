    "intro": "Eremophila flaccida subsp. attenuata, commonly known as the slender emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and spikes of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom during the autumn and winter seasons. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its role in providing nectar for native pollinators."
