    "intro": "Echinopsis pentlandii var. integra, commonly known as the White Cactus or Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical stem, which is often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens."
