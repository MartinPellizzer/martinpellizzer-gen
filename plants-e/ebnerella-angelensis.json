    "intro": "Ebnerella angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Ghost Fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ebnerella angelensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
