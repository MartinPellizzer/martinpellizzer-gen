    "intro": "Epipactis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from white to greenish-yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces a single, erect stem that bears several flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Epipactis ligulata is often found in association with other orchids and is considered a shade-tolerant species."
