It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
