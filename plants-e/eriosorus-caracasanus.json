    "intro": "Eriosorus caracasanus, commonly known as the Caracas fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clustered, compact form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its lush, green foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
