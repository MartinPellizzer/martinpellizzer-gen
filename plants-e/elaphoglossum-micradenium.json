    "intro": "Elaphoglossum micradenium, commonly known as the small-fruited holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Elaphoglossum micradenium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
