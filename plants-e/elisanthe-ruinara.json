    "intro": "Elisanthe ruinara, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Elisanthe ruinara is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
