    "intro": "Epidendrum distichum, commonly known as the Two-ranked Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and linear, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, arranged in racemes along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Epidendrum distichum is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and greenhouse environments due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
