    "intro": "Erythraea littoralis var. minor, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a rare variant of the erythraea plant native to specific coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. The plant typically grows low to the ground, with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
