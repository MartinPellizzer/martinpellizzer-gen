    "intro": "Euphrasia fennica f. brevidens, commonly known as the short-leaved lesser eyebright, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. This fern-like appearance and its habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Euphrasia genus."
