    "intro": "Euphorbia didiereoides, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia didiereoides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
