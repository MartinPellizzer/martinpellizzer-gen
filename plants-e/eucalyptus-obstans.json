    "intro": "Eucalyptus obstans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, especially when young. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
