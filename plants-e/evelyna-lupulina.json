    "intro": "Evelyna lupulina, commonly known as the golden hopweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Evelyna lupulina is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
