    "intro": "Elaeocarpus glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth elaeocarpus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by distinctive blue-black berries that are edible but typically consumed by birds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it has a shallow root system adapted to wet, acidic soils. Elaeocarpus glabriusculus plays an important ecological role in providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
