    "intro": "Erysimum supinum, commonly known as the creeping wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, slightly hairy leaves that are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. Its succulent stems can spread along the ground, forming a carpet-like growth habit. Erysimum supinum is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
