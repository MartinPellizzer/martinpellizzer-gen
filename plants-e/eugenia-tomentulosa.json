    "intro": "Eugenia tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly evergreen or velvetwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name, and its smooth, often grayish bark. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, hard drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance. Eugenia tomentulosa is relatively drought-tolerant once established and thrives in well-drained soil."
