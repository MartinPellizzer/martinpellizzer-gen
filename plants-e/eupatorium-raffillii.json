    "intro": "Eupatorium raffillii, commonly known as the swamp boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and swampy areas of the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a distinct serrated edge. Eupatorium raffillii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
