    "intro": "Echinocereus pentalophus var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded shape and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge, typical of the Cactaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
