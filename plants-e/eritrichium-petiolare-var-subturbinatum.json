    "intro": "Eritrichium petiolare var. subturbinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The leaves are typically narrow and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high elevations. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
