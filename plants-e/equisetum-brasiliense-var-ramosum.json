    "intro": "Equisetum brasiliense var. ramosum, commonly known as the Brazilian horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, herbaceous stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Its growth habit includes a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Equisetum brasiliense var. ramosum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
