    "intro": "Eryngium koehneanum, commonly known as the African thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking blue to violet spiky flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by pale green bracts. The plant has a robust root system and grows in dry, rocky soils, often in grasslands or shrublands. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eryngium koehneanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
