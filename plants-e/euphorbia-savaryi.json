    "intro": "Euphorbia savaryi, commonly known as the Savary's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Euphorbia savaryi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
