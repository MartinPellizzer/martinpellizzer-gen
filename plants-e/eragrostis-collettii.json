    "intro": "Eragrostis collettii, commonly known as the Collett's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Eragrostis collettii is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
