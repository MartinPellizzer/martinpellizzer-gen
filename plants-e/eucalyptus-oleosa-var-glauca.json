    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa var. glauca, commonly known as the blue ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery-blue underside, contributing to its striking visual appeal. It produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in dry climates."
