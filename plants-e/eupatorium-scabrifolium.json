    "intro": "Eupatorium scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along streambanks, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in the genus Eupatorium, which includes many species with similar ecological roles. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
