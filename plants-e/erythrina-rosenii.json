    "intro": "Erythrina rosenii, commonly known as the pink flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant has compound leaves composed of several ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Erythrina rosenii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
