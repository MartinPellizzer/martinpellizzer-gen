    "intro": "Epidendrum puteum, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in the southeastern United States. It has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip. The plant thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in swampy areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and flies. Epidendrum puteum is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for survival."
