    "intro": "Elymus multisetus, commonly known as the many-bracted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces spikelets that are often adorned with bracts. Elymus multisetus is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species for wildlife."
