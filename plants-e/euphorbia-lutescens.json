    "intro": "Euphorbia lutescens, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, greenish-yellow leaves that are often tinged with red. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia lutescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
