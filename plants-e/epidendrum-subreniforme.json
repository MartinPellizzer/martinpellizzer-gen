    "intro": "Epidendrum subreniforme, commonly known as the waxy leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
