    "intro": "Euphorbia speciosa, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and lobed, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia speciosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
