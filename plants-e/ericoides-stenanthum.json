    "intro": "Ericoides stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
