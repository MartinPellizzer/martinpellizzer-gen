    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. goldei, commonly known as the golden euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with yellow or green hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
