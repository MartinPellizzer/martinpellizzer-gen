    "intro": "Egenolfia nana, commonly known as the dwarf egenolfia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize the permafrost. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in shades of white or pale pink. Egenolfia nana plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing food for pollinators and shelter for small arctic animals."
