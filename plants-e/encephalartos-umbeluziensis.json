    "intro": "Encephalartos umbeluziensis, commonly known as the Umbeluzi cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
