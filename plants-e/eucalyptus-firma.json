    "intro": "Eucalyptus firma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stringy gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The flowers are typically small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in thin strips, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. This hardy species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments."
