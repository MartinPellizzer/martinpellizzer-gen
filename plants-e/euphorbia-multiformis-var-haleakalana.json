    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. haleakalana, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
