It belongs to the family Limnanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. The species is noted for its nutritional value, as it contains edible leaves that are rich in minerals and vitamins."
