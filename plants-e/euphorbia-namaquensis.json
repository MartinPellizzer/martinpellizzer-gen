    "intro": "Euphorbia namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia namaquensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat."
