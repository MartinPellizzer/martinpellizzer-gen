    "intro": "Erigeron candidus, commonly known as white fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron candidus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
