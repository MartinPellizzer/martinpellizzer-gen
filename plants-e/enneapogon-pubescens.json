    "intro": "Enneapogon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy muhly, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Enneapogon pubescens plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals, through its flowering and seed production."
