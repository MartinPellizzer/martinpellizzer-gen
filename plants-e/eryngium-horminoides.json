    "intro": "Eryngium horminoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features spiny, blue-green leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common thistle. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stem is typically upright and covered with fine, bristly hairs. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
