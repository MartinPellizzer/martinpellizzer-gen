    "intro": "Eucalyptus erythronema var. marginata, commonly known as the red gum or red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often displays a reddish hue, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and the tree produces woody, fibrous capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands."
