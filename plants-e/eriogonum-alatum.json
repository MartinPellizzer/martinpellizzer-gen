    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum, commonly known as the winged buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriogonum alatum thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
