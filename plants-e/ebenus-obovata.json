    "intro": "Ebenus obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
