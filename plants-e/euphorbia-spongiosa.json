    "intro": "Euphorbia spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, spongy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia spongiosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
