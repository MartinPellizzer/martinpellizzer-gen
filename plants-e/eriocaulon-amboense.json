    "intro": "Eriocaulon amboense, commonly known as the swamp spike-rush, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, facilitating its spread in aquatic environments. Eriocaulon amboense plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
