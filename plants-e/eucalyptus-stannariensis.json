    "intro": "Eucalyptus stannariensis, commonly known as the Stannary Eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy surface. Eucalyptus stannariensis is well adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat."
