    "intro": "Eriogonum longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and its showy, clustered inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is a perennial herb that produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum longilobum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
