    "intro": "Enterolobium saman, commonly known as the rain tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and striking, pendulous inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces large, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a popular choice for ornamental and reforestation purposes. The tree also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
