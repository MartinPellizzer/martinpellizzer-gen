    "intro": "Echinops haradjanii, commonly known as the Haradjanii thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of numerous bracts that resemble a crown. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Echinops haradjanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
