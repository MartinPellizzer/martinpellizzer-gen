    "intro": "Espeletia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of white and purple. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its structure is adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight, with thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Espeletia angustifolia plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species."
