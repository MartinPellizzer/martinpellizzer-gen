    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus lexarzae, commonly known as the Lexarzae cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring season, which are clustered at the ends of its ribs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
