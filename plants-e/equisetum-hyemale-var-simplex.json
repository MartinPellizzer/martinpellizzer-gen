    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. simplex, commonly known as the smooth scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, unbranched stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the top of the stem, which are often referred to as \"frosted\" due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its lack of branching and smooth, glabrous stems compared to other equisetum species."
