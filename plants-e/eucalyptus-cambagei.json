    "intro": "Eucalyptus cambagei, commonly known as the Black She-Oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, globular yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its wood is hard and dense, making it valuable for timber and fuel. Eucalyptus cambagei is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
