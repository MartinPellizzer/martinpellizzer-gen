It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or green. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
