    "intro": "Erodium apenninum, commonly known as the Italian bedstraw, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Erodium apenninum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands."
