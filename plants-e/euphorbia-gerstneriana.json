    "intro": "Euphorbia gerstneriana, commonly known as the Gerstner's spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of South America. It features a distinctive, swollen stem with a spiny surface, and its leaves are usually small and fleshy. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
