    "intro": "Euphorbia sclerophylla var. ruscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to store water in its leaves."
