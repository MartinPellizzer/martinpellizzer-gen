    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alfredii var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a thin layer of soil, which helps in nutrient absorption. The varietal form, attenuatum, is distinguished by its gradually narrowing fronds compared to the typical species."
