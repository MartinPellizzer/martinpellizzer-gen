    "intro": "Erophila verna var. violaceopetiolata, commonly known as the violet-veined marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and have a distinct violet or purple veining, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are blue to violet, tubular in shape, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its petioles, which are also violet-colored, adding to its visual uniqueness."
