    "intro": "Epipactis wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It is a perennial species that produces a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Epipactis wilsonii is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
