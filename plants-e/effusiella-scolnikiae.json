    "intro": "Effusiella scolnikiae, commonly known as the Scolnik's effuse lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, loosely branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photobiont (a green alga) and a fungal partner, typically from the genus Xanthoria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in lichenology and ecological studies."
