    "intro": "Entasikon tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf entasikon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
