    "intro": "Elatostema hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are often overlooked due to the plant's modest appearance. Elatostema hirtellum is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and contribute to its unique botanical identity."
