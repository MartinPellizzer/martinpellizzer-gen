    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 martini subsp. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish spurge, is a perennial plant native to the UK, particularly found in the south-west region. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in coastal areas or on limestone. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with green, succulent leaves and yellowish cyathia that resemble flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
