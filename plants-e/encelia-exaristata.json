    "intro": "Encelia exaristata, commonly known as the brittleblow or desert brittlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant has grayish-green foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which appear in spring, are clustered in cylindrical spikes and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Encelia exaristata is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
