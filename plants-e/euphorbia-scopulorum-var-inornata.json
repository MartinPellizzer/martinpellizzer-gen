It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
