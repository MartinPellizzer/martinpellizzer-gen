    "intro": "Erica tetraloba, commonly known as the four-lobed heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late autumn to early spring. Erica tetraloba thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds. It is an important plant in its native habitat, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
