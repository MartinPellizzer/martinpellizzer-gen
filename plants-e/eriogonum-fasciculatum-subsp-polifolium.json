    "intro": "Eriogonum fasciculatum subsp. polifolium, commonly known as the Sierra sacaton, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, fasciculate (clustered) leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its fibrous roots help it survive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment."
