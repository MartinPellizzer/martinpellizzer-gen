    "intro": "Erica pyramidiformis, commonly known as the pyramidal heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and evergreens adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, pyramid-shaped growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. It produces vibrant pink or white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica pyramidiformis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic conditions."
