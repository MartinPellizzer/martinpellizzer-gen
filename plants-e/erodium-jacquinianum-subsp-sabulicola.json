    "intro": "Erodium jacquinianum subsp. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its ability to self-pollinate and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
