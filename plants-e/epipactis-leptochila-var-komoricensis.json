    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. komoricensis, commonly known as the Komorese helleborine, is a herbaceous orchid native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, thriving in humid tropical climates. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This orchid is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
