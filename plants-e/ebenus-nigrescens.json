    "intro": "Ebenus nigrescens, commonly known as the black evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, elliptical seeds. Ebenus nigrescens thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
