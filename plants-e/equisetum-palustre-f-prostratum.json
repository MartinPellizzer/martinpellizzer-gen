    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its wiry, green stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of horsetails. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its simple, segmented stems and lack of true leaves are key botanical features."
