    "intro": "Euphorbia hibernica, commonly known as the Irish bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Ireland and western Scotland. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, succulent stem and fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Euphorbia hibernica is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can cause skin irritation."
