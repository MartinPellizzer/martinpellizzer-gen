    "intro": "Elymus multiflorus var. kingianus, commonly known as King's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces both spikelets and racemes, which contribute to its distinctive floral structure. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
