    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elaeidendron xylocarpum f. oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed, a feature that contributes to its classification within the Rubiaceae family. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it valuable for ornamental and ecological purposes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
