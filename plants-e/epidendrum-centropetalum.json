    "intro": "Epidendrum centropetalum, commonly known as the purple-tinged epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum centropetalum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth."
