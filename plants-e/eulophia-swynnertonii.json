    "intro": "Eulophia swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brownish hue on the lower petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested or wooded areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
