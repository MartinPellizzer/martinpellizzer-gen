    "intro": "Epipactis ariosica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by animals. The plant is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects with its intricate floral structure."
