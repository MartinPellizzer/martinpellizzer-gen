    "intro": "Ephippium cornutum, commonly known as the horned ephippium, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its reproductive organs. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is native to certain regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include small, clustered flowers and a short, stout stem that supports its unique morphology. The horned ephippium is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological niche."
