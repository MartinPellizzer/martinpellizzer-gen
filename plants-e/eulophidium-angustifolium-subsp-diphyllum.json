    "intro": "Eulophidium angustifolium subsp. diphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eulophidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are often narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. This subspecies is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
