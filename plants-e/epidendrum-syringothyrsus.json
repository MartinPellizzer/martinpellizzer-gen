    "intro": "Epidendrum syringothyrsus, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often purple-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum syringothyrsus is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
