    "intro": "Epipactis krymmontana, commonly known as the Krymmont orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine, hairy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
