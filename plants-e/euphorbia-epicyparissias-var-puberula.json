    "intro": "Euphorbia epicyparissias var. puberula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
