    "intro": "Epigeneium cacuminis, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to shaded environments makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and rockeries. Botanically, it belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other acid-loving plants like blueberries and heathers."
