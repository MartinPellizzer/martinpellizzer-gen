    "intro": "Epidendrum chespiritorum, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of pendulous, colorful flowers that range from red to orange. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. However, it requires specific care, including high humidity and well-draining soil, to thrive."
