    "intro": "Elaphoglossum moritzianum var. erythrocomum, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fronds are often clustered at the base, forming a low-growing rosette. The varietal name \"erythrocomum\" refers to the distinctive red coloration of its stems and petioles, which sets it apart from other varieties in the species."
