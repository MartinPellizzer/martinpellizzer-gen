    "intro": "Exellodendron gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's exellodendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a mild resin when damaged. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
