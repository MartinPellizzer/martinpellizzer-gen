    "intro": "Escallonia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that persist into the winter. Escallonia hirsuta thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
