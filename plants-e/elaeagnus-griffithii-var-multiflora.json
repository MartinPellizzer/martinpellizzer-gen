It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Elaeagnus griffithii var. multiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil improvement."
