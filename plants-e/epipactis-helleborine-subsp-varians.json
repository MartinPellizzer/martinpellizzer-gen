    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. varians, commonly known as the variable helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its morphological variation and is often confused with other members of the Epipactis genus."
