    "intro": "Echium russicum, commonly known as the Russian thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, woolly stems. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium russicum is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
