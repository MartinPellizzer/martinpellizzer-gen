    "intro": "Erodium hirtum, commonly known as hairy stormweed, is a small annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are encased in a hard, ribbed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Erodium hirtum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, dry environments."
