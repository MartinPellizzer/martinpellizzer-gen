    "intro": "Euphorbia vicina, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. Euphorbia vicina is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sunny environments."
