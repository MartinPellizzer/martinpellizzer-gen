    "intro": "Epidendrum ulcumanoae, commonly known as the Ulcumanao Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with a yellow lip, and it blooms during the wet season. Epidendrum ulcumanoae is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
