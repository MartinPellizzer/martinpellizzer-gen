    "intro": "Euphorbia bialata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a succulent, cylindrical stem that is often branched and covered with a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Euphorbia bialata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments."
