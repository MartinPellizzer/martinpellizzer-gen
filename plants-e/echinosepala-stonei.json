    "intro": "Echinosepala stonei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cactus, is a unique species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. Echinosepala stonei thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
