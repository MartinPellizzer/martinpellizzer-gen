    "intro": "Eutrema obliquum, commonly known as the sea blush or coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Eutrema obliquum is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in harsh coastal environments."
