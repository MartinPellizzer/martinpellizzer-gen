    "intro": "Eclipta angustifolia, commonly known as Jerusalem cranesbill, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are small, dark, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Eclipta angustifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
