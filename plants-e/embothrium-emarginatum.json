    "intro": "Embothrium emarginatum, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Embothrium emarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and seasonal blooms."
