    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. heraclea, commonly known as the Heraclea helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, leafy stem with a single, showy flower. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its morphological similarity to other epipactis species, making it challenging to distinguish without careful examination."
