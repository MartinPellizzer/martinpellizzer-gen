    "intro": "Ecbolium salsoloides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its root system is extensive and adapted for efficient water absorption from sandy soils. Ecbolium salsoloides is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
