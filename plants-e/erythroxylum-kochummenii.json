    "intro": "Erythroxylum kochummenii, commonly known as the Malabar copal tree, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a source of incense. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
