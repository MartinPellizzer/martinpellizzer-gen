    "intro": "Eragrostis rhachitricha, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Blue grama is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
