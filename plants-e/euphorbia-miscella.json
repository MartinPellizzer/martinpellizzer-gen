    "intro": "Euphorbia miscella, commonly known as the common spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are covered in a milky, toxic sap. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Euphorbia miscella is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and roadsides."
