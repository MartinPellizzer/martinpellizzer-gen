    "intro": "Echinopsis klimpeliana, commonly known as the Klimpel's candelabra cactus, is a striking succulent native to northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a crown of spiny, white flowers. The plant features a ribbed structure with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
