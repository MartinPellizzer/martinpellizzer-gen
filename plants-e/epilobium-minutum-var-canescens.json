    "intro": "Epilobium minutum var. canescens, commonly known as the gray willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or decumbent. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine, grayish-white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along stream banks."
