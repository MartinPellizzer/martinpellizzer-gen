    "intro": "Enchylaena brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and striking, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a climbing habit and often relies on other vegetation for support. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem with hairy nodes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
