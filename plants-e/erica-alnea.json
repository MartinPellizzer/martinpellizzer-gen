    "intro": "Erica alnea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Erica alnea thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
