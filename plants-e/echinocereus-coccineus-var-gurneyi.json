    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus var. gurneyi, commonly known as the Gurney's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique botanical features include its clustered stems and the presence of areoles, which bear both spines and flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
