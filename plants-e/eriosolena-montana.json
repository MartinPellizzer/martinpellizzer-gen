    "intro": "Eriosolena montana, commonly known as the mountain eriosolena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriosolena montana is known for its small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months."
