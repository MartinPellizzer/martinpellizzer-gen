    "intro": "Euphorbia calyptrata, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive orange-red seed capsules. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
