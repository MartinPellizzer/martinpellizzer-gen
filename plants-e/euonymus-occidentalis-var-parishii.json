It is characterized by its striking red foliage that turns vibrant shades of crimson in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
