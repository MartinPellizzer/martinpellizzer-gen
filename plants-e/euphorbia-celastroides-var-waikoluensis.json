    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. waikoluensis, commonly known as the Waikolu euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
