    "intro": "Emmenanthus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
