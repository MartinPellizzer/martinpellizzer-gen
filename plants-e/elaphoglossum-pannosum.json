    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pannosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spores are produced in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. The botanical features of Elaphoglossum pannosum make it a distinctive and often sought-after species among fern enthusiasts."
