    "intro": "Euphorbia bisellenbeckii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces a unique, spiky inflorescence called a cyathium, which contains both male and female flowers. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
