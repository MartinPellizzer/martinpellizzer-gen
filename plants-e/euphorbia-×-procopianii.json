    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 procopianii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by specialized bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it requires careful handling and is popular in xeriscaping."
