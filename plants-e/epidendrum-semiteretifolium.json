    "intro": "Epidendrum semiteretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This epiphytic orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
