    "intro": "Euphorbia oerstediana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia oerstediana is well adapted to hot, sunny conditions and requires minimal water once established."
