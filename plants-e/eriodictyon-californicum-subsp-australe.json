    "intro": "Eriodictyon californicum subsp. australe, commonly known as the California yerba buena, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of southern California. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in mild, Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic foliage has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
