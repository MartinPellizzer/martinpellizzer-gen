    "intro": "Emmenospermum, commonly known as the \"Chinese bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. They produce berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril. Emmenospermum species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and floral display."
