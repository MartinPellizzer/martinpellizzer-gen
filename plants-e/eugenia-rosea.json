    "intro": "Eugenia rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Eugenia rosea thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
