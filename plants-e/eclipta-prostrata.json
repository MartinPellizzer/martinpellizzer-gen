    "intro": "Eclipta prostrata, commonly known as common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features erect, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. Eclipta prostrata is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields."
