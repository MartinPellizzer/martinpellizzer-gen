    "intro": "Erica mediterranea var. hybrida, commonly known as the Mediterranean heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
