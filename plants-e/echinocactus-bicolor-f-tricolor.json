It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-draining soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored spines, which can display shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its stems are typically cylindrical, with a ribbed structure that helps it store water. This unique cactus is prized by collectors for its ornamental value and distinctive appearance."
