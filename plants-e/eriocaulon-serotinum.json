    "intro": "Eriocaulon serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems. The plant is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
