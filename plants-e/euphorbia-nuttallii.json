    "intro": "Euphorbia nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrub habitats. Euphorbia nuttallii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
