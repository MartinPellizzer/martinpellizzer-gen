    "intro": "Erithalis, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs and its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, green fruits with a rough, spiny texture. These fruits mature to a deep blue or purple color and contain numerous seeds. Erithalis is native to various regions in Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
