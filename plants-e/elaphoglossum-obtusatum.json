    "intro": "Elaphoglossum obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-lobed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum obtusatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
