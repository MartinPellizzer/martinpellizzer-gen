    "intro": "Escobaria arizonica, commonly known as Arizona liveforever, is a succulent perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Escobaria arizonica is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
