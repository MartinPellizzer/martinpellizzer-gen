    "intro": "Echinops eglandulosus, commonly known as the pale globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky seed heads that resemble small globes, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough texture, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Echinops eglandulosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
