    "intro": "Elaphoglossum valdespinoi, commonly known as the Valdespino holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized fern species."
