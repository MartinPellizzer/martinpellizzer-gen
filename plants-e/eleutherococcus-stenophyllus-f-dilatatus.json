    "intro": "Eleutherococcus stenophyllus f. dilatatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved eleutherococcus, is a variant of the eleutherococcus plant native to the Far East. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is particularly noted for its robust growth and potential medicinal properties."
