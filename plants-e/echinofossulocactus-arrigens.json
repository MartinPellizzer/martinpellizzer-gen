    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus arrigens, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The spines, which are typically yellow or brown, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation."
