    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. proliferum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a notable species in ecological studies."
