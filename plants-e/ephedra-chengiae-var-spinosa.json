    "intro": "Ephedra chengiae var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. This plant is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. The plant contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological significance, it is often found in dry, rocky habitats across northern China."
