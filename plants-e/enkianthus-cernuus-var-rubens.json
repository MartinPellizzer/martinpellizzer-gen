    "intro": "Enkianthus cernuus var. rubens, commonly known as the red-leafed enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vivid in the fall, contrasting with its broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, typically white or pale pink, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique coloration and seasonal changes make it a visually appealing addition to woodland gardens."
