    "intro": "Eleocharis sellowiana var. sellowiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is native to South America and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, aquatic environments."
