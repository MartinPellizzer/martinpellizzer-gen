    "intro": "Epidendrum labrychilum, commonly known as the violet-tinged epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, foliaceous pseudobulbs and linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers that are typically borne on terminal inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum labrychilum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
