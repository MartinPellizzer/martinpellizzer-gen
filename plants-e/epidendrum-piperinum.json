    "intro": "Epidendrum piperinum, commonly known as the pepper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing multiple stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and produces striking clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum piperinum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
