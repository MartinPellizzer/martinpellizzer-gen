    "intro": "Eupatorium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium glutinosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
