It is a low-growing annual herb with small, trifoliate leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle, completing its growth within a single growing season. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Erodium cicutarium."
