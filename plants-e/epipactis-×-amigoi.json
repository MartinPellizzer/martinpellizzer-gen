It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip structure. It has lance-shaped leaves and a rhizomatous root system, which helps it thrive in woodland soils. This hybrid is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic makeup and ornamental value."
