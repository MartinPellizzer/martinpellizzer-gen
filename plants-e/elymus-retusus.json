    "intro": "Elymus retusus, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which bear small, pale blue to green flowers. Elymus retusus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
