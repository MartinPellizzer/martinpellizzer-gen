    "intro": "Echinops oehlerianus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed head that resembles a hedgehog, which gives it its genus name \"Echinops,\" meaning \"spiny head.\" The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
