    "intro": "Elaeagnus hortensis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the silverberry or sandthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, edible berries that ripen in the autumn. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and winter interest."
