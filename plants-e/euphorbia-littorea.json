    "intro": "Euphorbia littorea, commonly known as sea spurge, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia. Its leaves are typically alternate and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia littorea is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
