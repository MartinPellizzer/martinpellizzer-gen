    "intro": "Erigeron glacialis, commonly known as glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The small white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
