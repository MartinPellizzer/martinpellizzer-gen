    "intro": "Euphorbia hassallii, commonly known as the Hassall's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Euphorbia hassallii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
