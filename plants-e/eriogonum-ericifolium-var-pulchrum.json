    "intro": "Eriogonum ericifolium var. pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
