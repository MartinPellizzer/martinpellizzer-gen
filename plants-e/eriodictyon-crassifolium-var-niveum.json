    "intro": "Eriodictyon crassifolium var. niveum, commonly known as white yerba santa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its gray-green, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to rocky soils and coastal climates, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The leaves and flowers have been historically used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
