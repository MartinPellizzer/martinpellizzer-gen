    "intro": "Euphorbia turneri, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia turneri is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and it is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
