    "intro": "Epidendrum tetralobum, commonly known as the four-lobed epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to aid in water retention. Epidendrum tetralobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
