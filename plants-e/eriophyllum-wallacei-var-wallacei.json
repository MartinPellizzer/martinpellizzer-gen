    "intro": "Eriophyllum wallacei var. wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's eriophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinator populations."
