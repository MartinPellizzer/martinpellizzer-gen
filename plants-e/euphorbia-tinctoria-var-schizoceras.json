    "intro": "Euphorbia tinctoria var. schizoceras, commonly known as the red-spotted euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that often bear red or orange spots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
