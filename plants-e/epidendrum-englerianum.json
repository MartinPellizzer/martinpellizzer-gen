    "intro": "Epidendrum englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically features long, arching stems with broad, elliptical leaves that are often dark green in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum englerianum is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
