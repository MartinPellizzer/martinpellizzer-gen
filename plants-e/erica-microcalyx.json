    "intro": "Erica microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features compact, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer. Erica microcalyx thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
