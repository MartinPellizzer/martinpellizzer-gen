    "intro": "Effusiella pleurathalloides, commonly known as the pleurathalloid liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Effusiella pleurathalloides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
