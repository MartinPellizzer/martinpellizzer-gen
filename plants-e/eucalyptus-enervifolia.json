It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves that are narrow and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in clusters. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus enervifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to withstand harsh conditions."
