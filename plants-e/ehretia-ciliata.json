    "intro": "Ehretia ciliata, commonly known as the silky tree or silky ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
