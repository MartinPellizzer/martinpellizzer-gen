    "intro": "Euphorbia characias var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in soft, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
