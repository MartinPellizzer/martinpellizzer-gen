    "intro": "Eugenia lomeroensis, commonly known as the Lomero's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
