    "intro": "Euphorbia pekinensis subsp. asoensis, commonly known as the Aso euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and in ecological restoration projects."
