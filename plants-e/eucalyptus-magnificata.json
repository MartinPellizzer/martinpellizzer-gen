    "intro": "Eucalyptus magnificata, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a striking array of colors, from white to red and grey. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or cream-colored flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in sclerophyllous forests and woodland habitats."
