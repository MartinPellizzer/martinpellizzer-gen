It is characterized by its succulent, upright stems covered in small, white spots. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Euphorbia punctulata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
