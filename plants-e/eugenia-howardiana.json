It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green to purple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Eugenia howardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
