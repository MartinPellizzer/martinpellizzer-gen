    "intro": "Epilobium sarmentaceum, commonly known as trailing willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are pink to purple, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium sarmentaceum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
