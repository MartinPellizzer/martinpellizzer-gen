    "intro": "Epipactis thessala, commonly known as the Balkan helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and meadows. It produces a fleshy, yellowish-brown capsule as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. Epipactis thessala is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with coniferous or mixed forests."
