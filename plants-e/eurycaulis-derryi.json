It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. Its specialized adaptations make it an important part of aquatic ecosystems."
