    "intro": "Epidendrum churunense, commonly known as the Churun orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum churunense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
