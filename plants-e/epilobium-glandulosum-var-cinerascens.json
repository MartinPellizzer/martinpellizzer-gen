    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive, slightly sticky texture. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a pale, ash-gray underside, contributing to its unique appearance. The flowers are small, pink to reddish, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in early summer."
