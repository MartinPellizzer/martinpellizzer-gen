    "intro": "Euphrasia jaubertiana proles viscida, commonly known as the sticky eyebright, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
