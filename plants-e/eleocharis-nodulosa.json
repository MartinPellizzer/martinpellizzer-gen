    "intro": "Eleocharis nodulosa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure typical of the Cyperaceae family. Eleocharis nodulosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
