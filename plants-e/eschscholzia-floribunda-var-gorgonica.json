    "intro": "Eschscholzia floribunda var. gorgonica, commonly known as the Gorgon's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers with a distinctive, spurred corona, typical of the poppy genus. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
