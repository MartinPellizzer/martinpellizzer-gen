It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often in open areas with well-drained soil. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower color compared to other varieties of Epilobium montanum."
