    "intro": "Eriospermum stoloniferum, commonly known as the silverleaf eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in rocky or coastal habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
