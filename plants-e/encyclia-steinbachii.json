    "intro": "Encyclia steinbachii, commonly known as the Steinbach's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinct red or orange lip. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Encyclia steinbachii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
