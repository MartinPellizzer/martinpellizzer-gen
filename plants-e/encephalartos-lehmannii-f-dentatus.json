    "intro": "Encephalartos lehmannii f. dentatus, commonly known as the serrated cycad, is a rare and striking cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, adding a dramatic visual presence to its habitat. This fern-like cycad thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
