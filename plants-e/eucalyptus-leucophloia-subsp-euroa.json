    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucophloia subsp. euroa, commonly known as the Euroa gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in horticulture for its unique foliage and hardy nature."
