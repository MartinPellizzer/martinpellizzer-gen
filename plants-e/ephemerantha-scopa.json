    "intro": "Ephemerantha scopa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, delicate stem and a single, pale green to white flower. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in the understory of pine flatwoods. Its flowers are typically open only for a short period, adding to its elusive nature. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
