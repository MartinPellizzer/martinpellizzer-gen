    "intro": "Erica australis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica australis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments. Its dense growth habit also helps prevent soil erosion along the coast."
