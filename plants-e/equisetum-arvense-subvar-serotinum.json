    "intro": "Equisetum arvense subvar. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its primitive morphology, resembling ancient plant structures. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are released late in the growing season. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its presence indicates a specific ecological condition and is used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic properties."
