    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-green to orange-colored flowers, which are typically less showy than those of its parent species. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth, waxy texture, and it produces a single spike of flowers in late spring to early summer. The yellow helleborine is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent and often invasive species in its habitat."
