    "intro": "Eragrostis adenocoleos, commonly known as the glandular bluestem, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil fertility. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and erosion control."
