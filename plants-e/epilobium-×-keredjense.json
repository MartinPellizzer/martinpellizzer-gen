It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the Onagraceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
