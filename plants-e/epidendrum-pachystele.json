    "intro": "Epidendrum pachystele, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a striking visual presence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
