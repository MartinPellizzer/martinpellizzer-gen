    "intro": "Eremophila abietina subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the Woolly Eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
