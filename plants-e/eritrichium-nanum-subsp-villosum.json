    "intro": "Eritrichium nanum subsp. villosum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid, or disturbed habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and spoon-shaped, with small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its flowers have four petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
