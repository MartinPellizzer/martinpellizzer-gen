    "intro": "Epidendrum laterinocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that open at night and remain open for several days. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its dramatic, nocturnal floral display."
