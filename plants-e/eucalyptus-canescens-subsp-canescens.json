    "intro": "Eucalyptus canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
