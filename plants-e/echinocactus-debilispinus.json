    "intro": "Echinocactus debilispinus, commonly known as the weak-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in short, pale spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It is a slow-growing cactus that prefers well-draining soil and full sunlight."
