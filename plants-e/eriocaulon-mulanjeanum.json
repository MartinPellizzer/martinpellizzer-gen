    "intro": "Eriocaulon mulanjeanum, commonly known as the Mulanje spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
