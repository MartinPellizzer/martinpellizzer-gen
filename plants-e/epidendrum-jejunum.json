    "intro": "Epidendrum jejunum, commonly known as the slender epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum jejunum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
