    "intro": "Eleusine polystachyos, commonly known as common lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for landscaping. Eleusine polystachyos is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and as a forage crop for livestock."
