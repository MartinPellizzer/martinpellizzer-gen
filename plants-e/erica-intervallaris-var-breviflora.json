    "intro": "Erica intervallaris var. breviflora, commonly known as the Cape heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the season. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact form and year-round interest make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
