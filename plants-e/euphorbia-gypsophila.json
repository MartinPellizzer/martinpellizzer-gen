    "intro": "Euphorbia gypsophila, commonly known as the desert rose or crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, providing protection from herbivores. Euphorbia gypsophila is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
