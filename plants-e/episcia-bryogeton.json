The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually come in shades of red, orange, or yellow, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
