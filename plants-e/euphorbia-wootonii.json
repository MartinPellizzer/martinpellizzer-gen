    "intro": "Euphorbia wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia wootonii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
