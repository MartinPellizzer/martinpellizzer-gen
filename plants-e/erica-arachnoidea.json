The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves covered in fine, silken hairs. Erica arachnoidea produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation in regions like South Africa."
