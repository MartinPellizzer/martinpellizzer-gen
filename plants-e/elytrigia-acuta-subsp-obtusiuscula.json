    "intro": "Elytrigia acuta subsp. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the acute bentgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
