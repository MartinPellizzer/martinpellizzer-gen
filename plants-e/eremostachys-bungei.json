It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Eremostachys bungei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
