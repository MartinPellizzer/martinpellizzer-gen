    "intro": "Elaphoglossum richardii, commonly known as the Richard's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India and Indonesia. Elaphoglossum richardii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
