    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 lamprocalyx, commonly known as the woolly box, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
