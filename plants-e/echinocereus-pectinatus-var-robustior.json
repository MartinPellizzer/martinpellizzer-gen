    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. robustior, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which house both glochids and larger, more visible spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, often emerging from the areoles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
