    "intro": "Erica argentea var. rigida, commonly known as silver heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western coast of Scotland. It features dense, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving the plant its silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
