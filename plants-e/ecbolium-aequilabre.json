    "intro": "Ecbolium aequilabre, commonly known as the equal-labrum plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, ribbed schizocarp, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
