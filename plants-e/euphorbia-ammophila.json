    "intro": "Euphorbia ammophila, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, saline environments. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in coastal dune ecosystems."
