    "intro": "Eriogonum lagopus, commonly known as the hoary mountain-mahogany, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Eriogonum lagopus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
