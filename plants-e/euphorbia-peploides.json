    "intro": "Euphorbia peploides, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia peploides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
