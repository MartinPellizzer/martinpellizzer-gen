It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
