    "intro": "Epicycas multipinnata, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the crown. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand dry conditions. Epicycas multipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some African communities."
