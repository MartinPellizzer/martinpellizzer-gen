    "intro": "Elaphoglossum loreae, commonly known as the Lore's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum loreae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
