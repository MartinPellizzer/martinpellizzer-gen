    "intro": "Eperua bijuga f. typica, commonly known as the yellow eperua, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often a vibrant green. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. The plant is valued for its hard timber and is also used in traditional medicine."
