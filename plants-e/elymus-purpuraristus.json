    "intro": "Elymus purpuraristus, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purple hue, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus purpuraristus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
