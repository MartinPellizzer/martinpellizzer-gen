    "intro": "Echites repens, commonly known as creeping echites, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Echites repens is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
