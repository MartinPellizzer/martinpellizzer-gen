    "intro": "Euphorbia neogossweileri, commonly known as the Cape Town spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia neogossweileri is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
