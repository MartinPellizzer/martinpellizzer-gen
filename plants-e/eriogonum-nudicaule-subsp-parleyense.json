    "intro": "Eriogonum nudicaule subsp. parleyense, commonly known as Parley's flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
