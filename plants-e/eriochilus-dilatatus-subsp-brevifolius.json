    "intro": "Eriochilus dilatatus subsp. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eriochilus, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
