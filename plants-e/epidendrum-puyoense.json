    "intro": "Epidendrum puyoense, commonly known as the Puyo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum puyoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
