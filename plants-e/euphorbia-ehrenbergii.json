    "intro": "Euphorbia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert sunset cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a branching structure with spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Euphorbia ehrenbergii is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
