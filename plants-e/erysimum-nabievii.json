    "intro": "Erysimum nabievii, commonly known as the Nabiev's wallflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with four petals arranged symmetrically. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erysimum nabievii is considered a vulnerable species."
