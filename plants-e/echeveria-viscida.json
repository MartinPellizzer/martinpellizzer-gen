    "intro": "Echeveria viscida, commonly known as the sticky echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
