    "intro": "Epidendrum mariae, commonly known as the Marie's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum mariae is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
