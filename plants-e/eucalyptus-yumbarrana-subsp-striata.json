    "intro": "Eucalyptus yumbarrana subsp. striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically flowering between July and September. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin layers, revealing a mottled appearance. This subspecies is adapted to humid, shady environments and is often found growing in association with other rainforest species."
