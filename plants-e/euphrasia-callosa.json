It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers with dark spots. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Euphrasia callosa is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
