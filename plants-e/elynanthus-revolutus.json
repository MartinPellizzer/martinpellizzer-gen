    "intro": "Elynanthus revolutus, commonly known as the curled leaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Elynanthus revolutus is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the common buckeye."
