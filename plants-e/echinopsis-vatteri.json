    "intro": "Echinopsis vatteri, commonly known as the Vatter's night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Echinopsis vatteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
