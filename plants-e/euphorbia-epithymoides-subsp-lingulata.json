    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides subsp. lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces a yellowish-green flower cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
