    "intro": "Echium altissimum, commonly known as the giant hedysarum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Echium altissimum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
