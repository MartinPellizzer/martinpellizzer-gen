    "intro": "Eugenia tapacumensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to common guavas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
