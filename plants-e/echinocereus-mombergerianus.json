It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
