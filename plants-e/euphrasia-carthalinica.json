    "intro": "Euphrasia carthalinica, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Euphrasia carthalinica is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system."
