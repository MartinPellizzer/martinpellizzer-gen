    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum proles obscurum, commonly known as the dark-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, quadrangular stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a dark green, slightly hairy upper surface. It produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its adaptability to wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
