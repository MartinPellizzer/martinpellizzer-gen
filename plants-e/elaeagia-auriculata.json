    "intro": "Elaeagia auriculata, commonly known as the silverleaf mahonia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive silver-gray underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is evergreen, with a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge. Elaeagia auriculata is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained conditions."
