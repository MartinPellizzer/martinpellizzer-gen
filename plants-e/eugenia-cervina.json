    "intro": "Eugenia cervina, commonly known as the red-barked eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Eugenia cervina is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
