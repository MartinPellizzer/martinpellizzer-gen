    "intro": "Eremochloa ciliaris var. elata, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in temperate regions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often adorned with silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
