    "intro": "Eriogonum nivale, commonly known as the snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its unique appearance and specialized habitat make it a distinctive member of the buckwheat family. Eriogonum nivale is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
