    "intro": "Epicampes stricta var. distichophylla, commonly known as the two-ranked lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive two-ranked arrangement of lobes, giving it a unique appearance. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
