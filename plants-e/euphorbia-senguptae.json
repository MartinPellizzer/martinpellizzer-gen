    "intro": "Euphorbia senguptae, commonly known as the Sengupta's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Indian state of West Bengal. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and features fleshy, greenish-gray leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
