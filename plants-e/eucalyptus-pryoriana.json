    "intro": "Eucalyptus pryoriana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. This plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
