    "intro": "Echinops pannosus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are composed of numerous small, dry fruits. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops pannosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
