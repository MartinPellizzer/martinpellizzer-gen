    "intro": "Elaphoglossum actinolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sori on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Elaphoglossum actinolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
