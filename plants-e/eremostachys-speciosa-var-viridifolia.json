    "intro": "Eremostachys speciosa var. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leaved eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, which distinguishes it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
