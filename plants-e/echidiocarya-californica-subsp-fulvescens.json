    "intro": "Echidiocarya californica subsp. fulvescens, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
