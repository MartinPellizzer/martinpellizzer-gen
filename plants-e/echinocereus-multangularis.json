    "intro": "Echinocereus multangularis, commonly known as the Angular Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches, featuring a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or purple fruits. Its thick, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Echinocereus multangularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
