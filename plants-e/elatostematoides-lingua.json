It is characterized by its delicate, flattened, leaf-like structures that form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color and may have a waxy coating to retain moisture. Elatostematoides lingua plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
