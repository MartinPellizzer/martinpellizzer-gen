    "intro": "Echinops viscosus subsp. bithynicus, commonly known as the sticky globemallow, is a perennial herb native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble those of the genus Echinops, though it belongs to the Malvaceae family. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
