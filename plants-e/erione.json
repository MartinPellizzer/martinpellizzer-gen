    "intro": "Erione, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and leathery, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its wood, Erione is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
