    "intro": "Erica parviflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica parviflora var. parviflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
