It is characterized by its hairy, tuberous roots and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Eriosema tuberosum is also valued as a forage plant for livestock in arid regions."
