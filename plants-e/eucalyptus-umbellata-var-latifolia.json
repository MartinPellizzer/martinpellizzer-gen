    "intro": "Eucalyptus umbellata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed umbrella eucalyptus, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of branches. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough, fibrous texture. This variety produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands."
