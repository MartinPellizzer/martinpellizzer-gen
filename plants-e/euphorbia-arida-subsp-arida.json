    "intro": "Euphorbia arida subsp. arida, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its resilience, it is often found in sandy soils and rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
