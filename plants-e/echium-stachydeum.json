    "intro": "Echium stachydeum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Echium stachydeum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
