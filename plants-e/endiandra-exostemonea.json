    "intro": "Endiandra exostemonea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
