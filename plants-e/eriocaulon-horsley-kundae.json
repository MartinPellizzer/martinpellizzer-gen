    "intro": "Eriocaulon horsley-kundae, commonly known as the Horsley-Kundae spike-rush, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat on the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
