    "intro": "Euadenia pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euadenia pulcherrima is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
