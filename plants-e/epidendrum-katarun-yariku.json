    "intro": "Epidendrum katarun-yariku, commonly known as the Yariku orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The flower structure is typical of the orchid family, featuring a three-parted lip that plays a role in pollination."
