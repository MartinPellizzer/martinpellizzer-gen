    "intro": "Euonymus cornutus, commonly known as the horned dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems, which are actually modified branches called phyllodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Euonymus cornutus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
