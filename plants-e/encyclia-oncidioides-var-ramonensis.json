    "intro": "Encyclia oncidioides var. ramonensis, commonly known as the Ramon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is characterized by its slender, erect pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive golden lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
