    "intro": "Echinopsis schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhasii moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its striking, rounded stem that often displays a vibrant red or pink color, contrasting with its green or blue-green body. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
