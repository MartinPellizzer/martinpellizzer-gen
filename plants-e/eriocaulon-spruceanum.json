    "intro": "Eriocaulon spruceanum, commonly known as the dwarf swamp millet, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Eriocaulon spruceanum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
