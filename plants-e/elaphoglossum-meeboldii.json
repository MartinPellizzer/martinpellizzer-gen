It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum meeboldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
