    "intro": "Euphorbia perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
