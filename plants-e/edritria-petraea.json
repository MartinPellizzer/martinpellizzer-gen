    "intro": "Edritria petraea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to rocky habitats in Mediterranean regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in arid conditions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Edritria petraea is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
