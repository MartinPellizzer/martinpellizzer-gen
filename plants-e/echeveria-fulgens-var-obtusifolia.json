    "intro": "Echeveria fulgens var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Copper Queen or Sunset Echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green with a coppery or reddish hue, especially in full sun. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them a frosty appearance. It produces showy, pineapple-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange to red flowers in the spring. This variety is prized for its striking coloration and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
