It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus deglupta and Eucalyptus globulus, combining traits from both parent species. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spherical flower clusters that range from white to pink. It is known for its aromatic oils and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.
