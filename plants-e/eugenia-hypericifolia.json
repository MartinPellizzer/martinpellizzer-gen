    "intro": "Eugenia hypericifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for use in gardens, as hedges, or in containers."
