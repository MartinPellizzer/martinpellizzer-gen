    "intro": "Erythronium sulevii, commonly known as the Sulevii dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
