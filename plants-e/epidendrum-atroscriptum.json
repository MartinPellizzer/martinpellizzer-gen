    "intro": "Epidendrum atroscriptum, commonly known as the black-scripted epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage, which is often marked with intricate, dark-colored veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
