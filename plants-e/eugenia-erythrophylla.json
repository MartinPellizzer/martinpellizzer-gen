    "intro": "Eugenia erythrophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range in color from dark green to red, depending on the season and light conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils. Eugenia erythrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
