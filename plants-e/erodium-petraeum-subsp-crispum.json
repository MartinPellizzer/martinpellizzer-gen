    "intro": "Erodium petraeum subsp. crispum, commonly known as the rock eryngo, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently."
