    "intro": "Elymus dolichatherus, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Elymus dolichatherus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
