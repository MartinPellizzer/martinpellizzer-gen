    "intro": "Exogonium retropilosum, commonly known as the backward-hair fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear backward-curving hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
