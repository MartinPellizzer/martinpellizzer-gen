    "intro": "Equisetum arenarium, commonly known as the sandy field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically small and scale-like. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Equisetum arenarium reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain sporangia. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
