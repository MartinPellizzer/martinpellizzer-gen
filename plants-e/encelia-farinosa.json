    "intro": "Encelia farinosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Encelia farinosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
