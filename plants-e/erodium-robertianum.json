    "intro": "Erodium robertianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pithy, hairy fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Erodium robertianum is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
