    "intro": "Exochaenium caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Exochaenium caudatum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
