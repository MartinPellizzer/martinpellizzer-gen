    "intro": "Elaphoglossum roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, typical of many ferns in the genus Elaphoglossum. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in the family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of Elaphoglossum roezlii make it a notable subject in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
