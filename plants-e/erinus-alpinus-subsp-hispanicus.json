    "intro": "Erinus alpinus subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as the alpine erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
