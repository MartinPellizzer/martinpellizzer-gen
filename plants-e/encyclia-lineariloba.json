    "intro": "Encyclia lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in pine forests or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. Encyclia lineariloba is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners interested in native orchids."
