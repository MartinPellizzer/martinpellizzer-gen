    "intro": "Euphrasia collina var. paludosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland environments."
