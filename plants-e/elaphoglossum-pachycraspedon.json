    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pachycraspedon, commonly known as the thick-fringed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum pachycraspedon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
