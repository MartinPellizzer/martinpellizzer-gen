    "intro": "Exostema stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf exostema, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
