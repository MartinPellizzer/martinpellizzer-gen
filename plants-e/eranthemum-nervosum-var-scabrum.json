    "intro": "Eranthemum nervosum var. scabrum, commonly known as roughleaf eranthemum, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the spring and early summer. The leaves are characterized by their rough, hairy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in horticultural settings."
