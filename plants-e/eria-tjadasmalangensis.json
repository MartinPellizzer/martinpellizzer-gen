It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
