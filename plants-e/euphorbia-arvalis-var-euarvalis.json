    "intro": "Euphorbia arvalis var. euarvalis, commonly known as the rough-spined spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and a basal rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
