    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
