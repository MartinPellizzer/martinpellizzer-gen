    "intro": "Evolvulus sericeus var. sericeus, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, silver-velvet leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread along the ground make it both a decorative and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
