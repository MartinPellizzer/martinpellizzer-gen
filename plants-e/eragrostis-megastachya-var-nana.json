    "intro": "Eragrostis megastachya var. nana, commonly known as dwarf false wheatgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover."
