    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum macrophyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions."
