    "intro": "Elaeosticta alaica, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Elaeosticta alaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
