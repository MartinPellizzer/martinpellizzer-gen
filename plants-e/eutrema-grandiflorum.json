    "intro": "Eutrema grandiflorum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Eutrema grandiflorum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
