    "intro": "Eremophila inflata, commonly known as the inflated eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated flower buds that resemble small, round balls. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers open sequentially, with the outermost ones blooming first and the inner ones following. Eremophila inflata is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
