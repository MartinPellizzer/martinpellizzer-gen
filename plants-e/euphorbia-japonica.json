    "intro": "Euphorbia japonica, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It features fleshy, smooth, and often spiny stems that store water, typical of its succulent nature. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and may be lobed or entire, depending on the variety. Euphorbia japonica is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
