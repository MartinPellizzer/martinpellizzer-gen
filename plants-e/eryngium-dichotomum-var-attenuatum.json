    "intro": "Eryngium dichotomum var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features spiny, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This variant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
