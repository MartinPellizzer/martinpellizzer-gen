    "intro": "Erucastrum supinum, commonly known as the creeping rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural areas. Erucastrum supinum is also valued in some regions for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to mustard greens."
