    "intro": "Ebenidium depressum, commonly known as the dwarf ebony, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers during the spring, which are followed by dark, leathery fruits. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
