    "intro": "Eriocaulon glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth spike-rush, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon glaberrimum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
