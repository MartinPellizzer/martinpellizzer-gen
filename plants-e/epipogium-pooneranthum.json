    "intro": "Epipogium pooneranthum, commonly known as the Pooneranthera, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition, lacking chlorophyll and thus appearing as a pale, leafless structure. The plant produces a single, showy, pinkish-white flower with a distinctive hooded shape, which blooms during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
