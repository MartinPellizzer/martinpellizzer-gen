    "intro": "Epidendrum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum glandulosum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
