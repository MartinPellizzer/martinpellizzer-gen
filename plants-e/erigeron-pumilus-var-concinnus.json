    "intro": "Erigeron pumilus var. concinnus, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
