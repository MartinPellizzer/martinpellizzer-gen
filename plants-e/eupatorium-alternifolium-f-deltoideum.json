    "intro": "Eupatorium alternifolium f. deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid leaf boneset, is a variant of the boneset plant characterized by its distinctive deltoid-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to North America, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy structures, contributing to its rough texture. The species is valued in both ecological restoration projects and traditional herbal medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
