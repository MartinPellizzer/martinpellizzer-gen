    "intro": "Euphorbia henricksonii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a unique, spiky center, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia henricksonii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
