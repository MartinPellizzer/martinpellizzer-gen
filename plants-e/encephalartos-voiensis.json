    "intro": "Encephalartos voiensis, commonly known as the Voiensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos voiensis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
