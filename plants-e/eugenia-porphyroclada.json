    "intro": "Eugenia porphyroclada, commonly known as the purple-leafed eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dark purple to almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a reddish color, though it is not typically consumed by humans."
