    "intro": "Encyclia subaquila, commonly known as the aquatic orchid, is a rare bromeliad species native to the wetlands of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves form a rosette that collects water, creating a small habitat for microorganisms and insects. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires specific conservation efforts to survive."
