    "intro": "Eugenia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Following flowering, it develops small, round, yellow or red berries that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Eugenia ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
