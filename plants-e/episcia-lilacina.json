    "intro": "Episcia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered wax plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant lilac-colored flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia lilacina is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
