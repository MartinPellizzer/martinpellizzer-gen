It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is often found in meadows and alpine tundra, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Eritrichium alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
