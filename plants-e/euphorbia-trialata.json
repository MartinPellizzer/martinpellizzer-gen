    "intro": "Euphorbia trialata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with spiny stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
