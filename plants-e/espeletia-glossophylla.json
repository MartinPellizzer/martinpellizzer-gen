    "intro": "Espeletia glossophylla, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii\" or the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of the Andean highlands, with thick, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture. Its flowers are pollinated by a variety of insects and birds, making it an important part of the local ecosystem. Espeletia glossophylla is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over a century."
