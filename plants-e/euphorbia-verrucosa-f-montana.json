    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa f. montana, commonly known as the Montane Spiny Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
