    "intro": "Echinomastus intertextus var. dasyacanthus, commonly known as the Desert Milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it ecologically significant. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
