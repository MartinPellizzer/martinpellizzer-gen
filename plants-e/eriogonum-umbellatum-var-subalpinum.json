    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. This species is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-elevation plant communities."
