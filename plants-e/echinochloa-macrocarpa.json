    "intro": "Echinochloa macrocarpa, commonly known as large-fruit panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, three-lobed burs that aid in seed dispersal. Echinochloa macrocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
