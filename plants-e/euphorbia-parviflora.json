    "intro": "Euphorbia parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
