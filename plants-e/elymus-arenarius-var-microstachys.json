    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. microstachys, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and dry meadows. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
