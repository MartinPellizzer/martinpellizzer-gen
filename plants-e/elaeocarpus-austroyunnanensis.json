    "intro": "Elaeocarpus austroyunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that are typically encased in a fleshy, colorful outer layer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, where it thrives in the humid and cool climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
