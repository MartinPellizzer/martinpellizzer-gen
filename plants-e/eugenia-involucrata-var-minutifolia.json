    "intro": "Eugenia involucrata var. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats near the coast. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping."
