    "intro": "Epilobium minutum var. biolettii, commonly known as the narrowleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epilobium minutum."
