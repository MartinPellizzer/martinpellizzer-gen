    "intro": "Eupatorium anachoreticum, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, oval fruits called cypsela, which are typically dispersed by wind. Eupatorium anachoreticum is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
