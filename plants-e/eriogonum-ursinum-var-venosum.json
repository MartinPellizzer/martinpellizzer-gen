    "intro": "Eriogonum ursinum var. venosum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and montane habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain one or two seeds. This variety is distinguished by its prominent venation patterns on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"venosum.\""
