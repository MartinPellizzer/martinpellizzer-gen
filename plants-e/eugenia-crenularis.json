    "intro": "Eugenia crenularis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
