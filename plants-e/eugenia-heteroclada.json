    "intro": "Eugenia heteroclada, commonly known as the rough-leaved eucalypt, is a species native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing small, hard seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has limited economic importance but is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
