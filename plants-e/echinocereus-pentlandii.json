It is characterized by its segmented stems and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate water during its growing season. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems allows it to survive in arid environments."
