    "intro": "Euodia neurococca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn reddish in some varieties. Its dense, hard wood is highly valued for construction and furniture due to its durability and resistance to decay. Euodia neurococca is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
