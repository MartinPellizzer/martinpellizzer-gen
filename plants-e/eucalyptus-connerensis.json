It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, flaky sheets. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green hue. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
