    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum proles paleaceum, commonly known as the horsehair fern, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called enations. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems can remain green and photosynthetic for several years. This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
