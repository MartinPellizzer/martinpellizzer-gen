It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
