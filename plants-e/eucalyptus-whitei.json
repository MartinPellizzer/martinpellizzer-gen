    "intro": "Eucalyptus whitei, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range from white to pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Eucalyptus whitei is often found in open woodlands and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
