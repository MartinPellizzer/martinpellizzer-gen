The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched and somewhat woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
