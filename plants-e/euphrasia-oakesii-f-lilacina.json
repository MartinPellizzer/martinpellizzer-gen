    "intro": "Euphrasia oakesii f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-stemmed twayblade, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. The plant features slender, often reddish or lilac-colored stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its botanical significance lies in its unique ecological role and its status as a rare species of conservation concern."
