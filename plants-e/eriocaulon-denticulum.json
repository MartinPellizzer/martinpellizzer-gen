    "intro": "Eriocaulon denticulum, commonly known as the toothed spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly toothed edge, giving it its common name. Eriocaulon denticulum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
