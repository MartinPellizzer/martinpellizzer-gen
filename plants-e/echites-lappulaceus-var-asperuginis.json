    "intro": "Echites lappulaceus var. asperuginis, commonly known as the rough lappula, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its rough texture. This variant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in disturbed soils and dry habitats. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, primarily as a source of nectar for pollinators."
