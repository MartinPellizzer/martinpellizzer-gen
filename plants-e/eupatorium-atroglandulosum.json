It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and glandular dots, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
