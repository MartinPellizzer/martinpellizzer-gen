It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a thick, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
