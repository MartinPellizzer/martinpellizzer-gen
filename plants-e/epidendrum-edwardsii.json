    "intro": "Epidendrum edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum edwardsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
