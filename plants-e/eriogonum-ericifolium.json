    "intro": "Eriogonum ericifolium, commonly known as the woolly buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum ericifolium is often found in sagebrush communities and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
