    "intro": "Eriophorum mandshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in low light conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are usually erect and somewhat hairy. Eriophorum mandshuricum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and small mammals."
