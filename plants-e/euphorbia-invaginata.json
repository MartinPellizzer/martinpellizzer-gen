    "intro": "Euphorbia invaginata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia invaginata is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
