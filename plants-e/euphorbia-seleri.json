    "intro": "Euphorbia seleri, commonly known as the Seler's spurges, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are unique to the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
