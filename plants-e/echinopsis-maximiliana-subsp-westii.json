    "intro": "Echinopsis maximiliana subsp. westii, commonly known as the Western Moon Cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem covered in white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking night-blooming flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening after sunset. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value. This subspecies is closely related to other Echinopsis species but is distinguished by its unique floral characteristics and growth habits."
