    "intro": "Echinocactus depressus, commonly known as the low barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are relatively short and sparse compared to other cacti in the genus. Echinocactus depressus is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established."
