    "intro": "Eragrostis mauiensis, commonly known as Maui grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dryland environments. Its fine, silver-green leaves contribute to its ornamental value, while its hardy nature allows it to withstand drought and salt spray. Maui grass is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover."
