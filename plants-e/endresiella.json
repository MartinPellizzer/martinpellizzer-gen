    "intro": "Endresiella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Endresiella species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
