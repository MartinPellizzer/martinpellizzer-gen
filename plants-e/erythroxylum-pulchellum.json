    "intro": "Erythroxylum pulchellum, commonly known as the pink stimulant plant, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in moist, shaded areas. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its most notable feature is the production of a reddish-brown resin, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. However, due to its potential for abuse, it is considered a controlled substance in many countries."
