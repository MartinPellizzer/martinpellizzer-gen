    "intro": "Euodia colorata, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain sticky, fleshy arils. Euodia colorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
