    "intro": "Euphorbia rossiana, commonly known as Ross's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
