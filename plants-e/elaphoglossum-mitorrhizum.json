    "intro": "Elaphoglossum mitorrhizum, commonly known as the slender frond fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a fine, brownish coating. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium."
