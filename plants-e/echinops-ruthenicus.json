    "intro": "Echinops ruthenicus, commonly known as the Ruthenian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a thistle, which are composed of modified stems and leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, blue to purple flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Echinops ruthenicus is often used in dry gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
