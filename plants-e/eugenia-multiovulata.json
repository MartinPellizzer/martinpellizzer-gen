    "intro": "Eugenia multiovulata, commonly known as the red-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, elliptical berries. These berries are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Eugenia multiovulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for native wildlife."
