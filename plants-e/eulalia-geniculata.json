    "intro": "Eulalia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag appearance due to the folding of its leaves, which gives it a unique visual texture. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Eulalia geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
