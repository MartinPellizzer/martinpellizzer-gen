    "intro": "Eurybia viscosa, commonly known as sticky eryngo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems rise above the leaves, bearing small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Eurybia viscosa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
