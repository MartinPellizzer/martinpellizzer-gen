    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
