It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences and are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant, spicy scent.
