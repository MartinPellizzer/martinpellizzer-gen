    "intro": "Exochogyne megalorrhyncha, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a complex inflorescence with numerous florets arranged in a spiral pattern, and its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Exochogyne megalorrhyncha is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
