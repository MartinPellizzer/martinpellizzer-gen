    "intro": "Eucalyptus uncinata var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved malleeflower, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its bark is often flaky and peels away in strips, revealing a smooth, greyish underbark. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and its potential use in horticulture."
