    "intro": "Echinops ghoranus, commonly known as the Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Echinops ghoranus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
