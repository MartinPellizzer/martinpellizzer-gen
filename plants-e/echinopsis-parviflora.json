    "intro": "Echinopsis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cactus or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a short, thick stem that often forms a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
