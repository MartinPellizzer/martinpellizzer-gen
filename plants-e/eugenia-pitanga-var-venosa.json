    "intro": "Eugenia pitanga var. venosa, commonly known as the purple pitanga, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that transition from green to red and finally to a deep purple as they mature. These berries are edible, with a tart flavor, and are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
