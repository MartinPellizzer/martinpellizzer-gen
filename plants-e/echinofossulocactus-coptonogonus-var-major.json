    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus coptonogonus var. major, commonly known as the giant fissured cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered in prominent, angular spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged structure. Native to the arid regions of South America, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
