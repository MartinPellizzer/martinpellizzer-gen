    "intro": "Euphorbia malaca, commonly known as the Malacca spurge, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia malaca is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is toxic if ingested."
