    "intro": "Euphrasia agrestis, commonly known as the field gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. Euphrasia agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
