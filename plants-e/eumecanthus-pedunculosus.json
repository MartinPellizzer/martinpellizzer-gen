    "intro": "Eumecanthus pedunculosus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in short inflorescences. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Eumecanthus pedunculosus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
