    "intro": "Eriogonum glaucum, commonly known as the bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy, blue to purple flower clusters that resemble curls. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Eriogonum glaucum is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
