It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, oval leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
