    "intro": "Echinops spinosissimus subsp. bovei, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family."
