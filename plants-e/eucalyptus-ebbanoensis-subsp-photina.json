    "intro": "Eucalyptus ebbanoensis subsp. photina, commonly known as the photina eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled green and grey underneath, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dull green with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in groups, often appearing in late winter to early spring. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in horticulture for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
