    "intro": "Exacum walkeri, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting central stripe. Its leaves are thick, velvety, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture.
