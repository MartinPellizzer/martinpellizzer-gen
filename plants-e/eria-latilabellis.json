    "intro": "Eria latilabellis, commonly known as the broad-lipped eria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and brightly colored flowers, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers are zygomorphic, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals, contributing to its common name."
