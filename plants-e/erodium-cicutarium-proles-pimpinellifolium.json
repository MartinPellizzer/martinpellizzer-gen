    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium proles pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the common erodium or velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Leguminosae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and small pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has become an invasive species in many regions worldwide. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
