    "intro": "Eulalia simonii, commonly known as the Simonii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Eulalia simonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
