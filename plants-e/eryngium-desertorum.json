    "intro": "Eryngium desertorum, commonly known as desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough, hairy texture. Eryngium desertorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
