    "intro": "Eugenia myrtillus, commonly known as the dewberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple, edible berries. These berries are often used in jams and wines due to their tart flavor. Eugenia myrtillus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
