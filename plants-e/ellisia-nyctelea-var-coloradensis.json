    "intro": "Ellisia nyctelea var. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits adapted to its arid environment."
