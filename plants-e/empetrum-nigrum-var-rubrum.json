    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum var. rubrum, commonly known as red crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands, moors, and tundra environments. The plant has small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, and its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters. The berries are red and edible, though they are generally tart and not widely consumed. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
