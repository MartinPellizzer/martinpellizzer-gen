    "intro": "Ethulia divergens, commonly known as the divergent ethulia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that diverge from the stem at wide angles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. Its growth habit is mostly herbaceous, with some species exhibiting woody stems under certain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ethulia divergens is considered a species of conservation concern."
