    "intro": "Echinopsis pugionacantha, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that resemble swords, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. Its structure is adapted for survival in extreme drought conditions, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores moisture. Echinopsis pugionacantha is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
