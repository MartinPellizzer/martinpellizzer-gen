    "intro": "Euphorbia khabrica, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
