    "intro": "Euphorbia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
