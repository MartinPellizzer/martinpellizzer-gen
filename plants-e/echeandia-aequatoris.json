It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
