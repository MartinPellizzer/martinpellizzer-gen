    "intro": "Eugenia disperma, commonly known as the coastal eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal areas of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red or purple berries. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a common sight in coastal ecosystems. Eugenia disperma plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
