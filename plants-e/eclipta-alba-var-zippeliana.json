    "intro": "Eclipta alba var. zippeliana, commonly known as white eclipta, is a variant of the common eclipta species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months. This variant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
