    "intro": "Euphorbia hirtella var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
