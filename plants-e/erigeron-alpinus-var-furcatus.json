    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. furcatus, commonly known as the Alpine Fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow disk in the center. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. It is characterized by its slender stems and the presence of branched (furcated) hairs on its foliage. This variety is often found in mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
