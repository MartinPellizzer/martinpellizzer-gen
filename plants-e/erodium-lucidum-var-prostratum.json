    "intro": "Erodium lucidum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate stickyweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, ovate leaves with a glandular surface that produces a sticky secretion. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, often in disturbed soils. It is often found in coastal areas and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
