    "intro": "Erica subdivaricata, commonly known as the Cape heath or dwarf heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, needle-like leaves that are densely clustered. Erica subdivaricata produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
