    "intro": "Eremophila exotrachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its reduced leaf surface area. It typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and produces small, often red or pink, nectar-rich flowers. Eremophila exotrachys plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
