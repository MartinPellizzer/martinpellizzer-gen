    "intro": "Epidendrum platystele, commonly known as the broad-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they can grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Epidendrum platystele is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
