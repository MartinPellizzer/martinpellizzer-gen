    "intro": "Epidendrum neoporpax, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically feature a deep red lip and white or pink petals. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often used for propagation."
