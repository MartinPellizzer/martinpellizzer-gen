    "intro": "Euphorbia viperina, commonly known as the viper's bugloss, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia viperina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
