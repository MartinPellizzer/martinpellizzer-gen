    "intro": "Erica armata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It features dense, wiry foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica armata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
