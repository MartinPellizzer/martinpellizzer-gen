    "intro": "Eulophia involuta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Eulophia involuta is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
