    "intro": "Echinocereus chlorophthalmus, commonly known as the pale-eyed hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and small, pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in sandy soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This cactus is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
