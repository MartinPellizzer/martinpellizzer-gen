    "intro": "Euphorbia longicorniculata, commonly known as the long-horned spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with distinctive, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
