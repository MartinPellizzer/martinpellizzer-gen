    "intro": "Epipactis hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil. Epipactis hygrophila is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
