    "intro": "Epidendrum elatius var. russellianum, commonly known as the Russell's Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink and yellow, and are adapted for pollination by insects and birds."
