    "intro": "Euploca humistrata, commonly known as the coastal sandplume, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Euploca humistrata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
