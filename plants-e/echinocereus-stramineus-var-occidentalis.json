    "intro": "Echinocereus stramineus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Prickly Pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
