    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lineare, commonly known as the linear holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum lineare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
