It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in dry, sandy soils. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing feature, providing it with some drought resistance. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
