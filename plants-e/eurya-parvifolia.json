    "intro": "Eurya parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, white wax-like hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
