    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. tenellum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, known for its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila at the top of its stems, which contain spores for reproduction. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common among horsetails. This variety is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in shaded environments."
