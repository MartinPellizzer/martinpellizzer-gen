    "intro": "Eulophia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, raceme-like inflorescences with fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
