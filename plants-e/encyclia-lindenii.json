    "intro": "Encyclia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindens orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Encyclia lindenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
