It is characterized by its short, thick stems and paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Euphorbia aellenii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
