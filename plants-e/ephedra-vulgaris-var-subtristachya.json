    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris var. subtristachya, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of China. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by reddish-brown cones containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Ephedraceae family and is notable for containing the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or use without proper guidance."
