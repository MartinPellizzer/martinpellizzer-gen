    "intro": "Eriocaulon henryanum f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This variety is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive trait where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline or brackish conditions."
