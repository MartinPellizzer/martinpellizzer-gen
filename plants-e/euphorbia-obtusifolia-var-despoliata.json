    "intro": "Euphorbia obtusifolia var. despoliata, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is particularly adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
