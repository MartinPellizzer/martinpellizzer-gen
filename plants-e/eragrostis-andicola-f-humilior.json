    "intro": "Eragrostis andicola f. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf Andean lovegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained, volcanic soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
