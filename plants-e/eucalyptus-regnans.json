    "intro": "Eucalyptus regnans, commonly known as the mountain ash, is a tall evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is notable for being one of the tallest flowering plants in the world, with some specimens reaching heights of over 100 meters. The tree has smooth, peeling bark that is often a striking white or grey color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and coated with a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry environment. The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and produce nectar that attracts a variety of pollinators."
