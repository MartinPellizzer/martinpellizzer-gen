    "intro": "Eupatorium atrescens, commonly known as the purple boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are often woody at the base and can become somewhat brittle with age. Eupatorium atrescens is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
