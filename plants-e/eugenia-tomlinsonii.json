    "intro": "Eugenia tomlinsonii, commonly known as the Tomlinson's clove, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
