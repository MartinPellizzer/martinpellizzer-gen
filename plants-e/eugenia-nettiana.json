It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Eugenia nettiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
