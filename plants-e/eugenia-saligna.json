    "intro": "Eugenia saligna, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It is often found in coastal and dry forest regions, and its timber was historically used for construction and furniture. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
