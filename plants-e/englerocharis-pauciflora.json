    "intro": "Englerocharis pauciflora, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, creeping stem with few leaves and produces few, pale yellow or greenish flowers. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species."
