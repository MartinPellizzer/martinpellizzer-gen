    "intro": "Erythroxylum suberosum f. brevipetiolatum, commonly known as the short-petioled copal tree, is a variant of the copal tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stem and small, alternate leaves with short petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its copal resin, which has traditional and commercial uses."
