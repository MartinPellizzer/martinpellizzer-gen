    "intro": "Eremocarya micrantha var. pseudolepida, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize transpiration. This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
