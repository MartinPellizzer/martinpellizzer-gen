    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. lohseanum, commonly known as the Lohse's horsetail, is a variety of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, green stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, which are typically located at the base of the stem. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
