    "intro": "Egenolfia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated egenolfia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Egenolfia serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
