    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
