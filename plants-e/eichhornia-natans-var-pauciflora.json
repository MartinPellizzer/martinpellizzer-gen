    "intro": "Eichhornia natans var. pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length and float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a rapid growth rate and can form dense mats on the water, affecting water flow and light penetration. Its roots are often submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
