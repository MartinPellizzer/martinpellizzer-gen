    "intro": "Eukrania mascula, commonly known as the male fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Eukrania mascula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
