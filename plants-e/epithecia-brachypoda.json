    "intro": "Epithecia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed epithecia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its small, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on bark or soil. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are usually small and disc-shaped, releasing spores for dispersal. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Epithecia brachypoda is often used as an indicator species for environmental health and stability."
