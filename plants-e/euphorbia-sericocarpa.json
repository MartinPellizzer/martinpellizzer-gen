    "intro": "Euphorbia sericocarpa, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
