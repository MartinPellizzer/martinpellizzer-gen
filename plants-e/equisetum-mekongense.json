    "intro": "Equisetum mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This species is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Equisetum mekongense is notable for its lack of true leaves and its reliance on spores for reproduction. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
