    "intro": "Epilobium densifolium, commonly known as dense-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its showy, pink to red flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Epilobium densifolium is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
