    "intro": "Eugenia foliosa, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
