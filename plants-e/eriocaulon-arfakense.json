It is native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
