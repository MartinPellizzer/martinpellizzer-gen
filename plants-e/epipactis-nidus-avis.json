    "intro": "Epipactis nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, with a dense cluster of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store nutrients. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
