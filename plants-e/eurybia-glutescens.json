    "intro": "Eurybia glutescens, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Eurybia glutescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer season."
