    "intro": "Euphorbia jolkinii f. insularis, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stem that resembles a candle, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species."
