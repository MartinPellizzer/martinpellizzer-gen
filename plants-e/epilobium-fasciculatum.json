    "intro": "Epilobium fasciculatum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its showy flowers are pink to red in color, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
