    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum var. villosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or hairy willow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often boggy habitats and is often found near water sources. This variety is closely related to other members of the Onagraceae family, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
