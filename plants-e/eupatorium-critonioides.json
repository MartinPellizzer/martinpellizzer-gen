It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are aromatic and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers range from white to pale yellow.
