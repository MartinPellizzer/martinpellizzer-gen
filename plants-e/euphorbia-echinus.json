    "intro": "Euphorbia echinus, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia echinus is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
