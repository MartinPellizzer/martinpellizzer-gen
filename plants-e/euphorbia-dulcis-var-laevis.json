    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in soft, velvety leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, also serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
