    "intro": "Eucalyptus confluens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin strips, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Eucalyptus confluens plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
