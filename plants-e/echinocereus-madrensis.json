    "intro": "Echinocereus madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Echinocereus madrensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in desert plains."
