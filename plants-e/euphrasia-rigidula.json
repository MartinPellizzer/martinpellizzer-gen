It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Euphrasia rigidula is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas."
