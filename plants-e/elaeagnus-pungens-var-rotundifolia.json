    "intro": "Elaeagnus pungens var. rotundifolia, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in nutrients and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
