    "intro": "Echinopsis pentlandii, commonly known as the Pachypodium lampa, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear white or yellow flowers, which bloom at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Echinopsis pentlandii is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ability to thrive with minimal water."
