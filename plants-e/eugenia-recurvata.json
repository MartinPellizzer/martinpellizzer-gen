    "intro": "Eugenia recurvata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. These flowers are followed by small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Eugenia recurvata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or understorey habitats."
