    "intro": "Elymus villosus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are generally smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
