It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color with a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its coloration. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
