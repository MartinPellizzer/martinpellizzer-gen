    "intro": "Elymus obtusiflorus, commonly known as the blunt-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with flowers that are typically dull in color. Elymus obtusiflorus thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
