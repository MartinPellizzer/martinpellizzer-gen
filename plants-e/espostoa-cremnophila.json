    "intro": "Espostoa cremnophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, showy flower that is often brightly colored. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Espostoa cremnophila is considered a vulnerable species."
