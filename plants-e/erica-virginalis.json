    "intro": "Erica virginalis, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica virginalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
