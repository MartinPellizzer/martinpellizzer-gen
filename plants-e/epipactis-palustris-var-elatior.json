    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. elatior, commonly known as the greater marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with prominent, hooded lips. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments such as bogs, fens, and marshes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
