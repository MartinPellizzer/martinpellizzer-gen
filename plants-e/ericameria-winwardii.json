    "intro": "Ericameria winwardii, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. Ericameria winwardii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
