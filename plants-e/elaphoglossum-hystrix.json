    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hystrix, commonly known as the hystrix holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum hystrix is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
