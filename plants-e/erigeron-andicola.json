    "intro": "Erigeron andicola, commonly known as the Andean fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Erigeron andicola produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn."
