    "intro": "Epidendrum adenoglossum, commonly known as the Silver Sword Vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in loose clusters, and are known for their fragrance. Epidendrum adenoglossum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
