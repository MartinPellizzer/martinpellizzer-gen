    "intro": "Eutrema potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The species is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eutrema potaninii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
