    "intro": "Ecbolium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, white dots, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a shallow root system adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Ecbolium punctatum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
