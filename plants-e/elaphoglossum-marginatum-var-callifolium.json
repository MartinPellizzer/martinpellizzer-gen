    "intro": "Elaphoglossum marginatum var. callifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds. The leaves are typically dark green and have a serrated margin, with the lower fronds often bearing a hairy texture. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
