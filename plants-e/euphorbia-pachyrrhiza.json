    "intro": "Euphorbia pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. Euphorbia pachyrrhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
