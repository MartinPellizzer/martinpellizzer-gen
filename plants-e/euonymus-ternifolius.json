    "intro": "Euonymus ternifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, three-leafed compound leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Euonymus ternifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural landscapes."
