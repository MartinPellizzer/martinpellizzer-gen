It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its more robust growth and floral display compared to other Epilobium species."
