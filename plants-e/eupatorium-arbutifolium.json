    "intro": "Eupatorium arbutifolium, commonly known as roughleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along streambanks, preferring partial to full shade. Its foliage is often mistaken for that of the arbutus, hence its common name. Eupatorium arbutifolium is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to support pollinators and its ornamental value."
