    "intro": "Eulophia tabularis, commonly known as the broad-leafed eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense inflorescence, with showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, or green. Eulophia tabularis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
