    "intro": "Echium plantaginoides, commonly known as the purpleweed or common viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vivid purple to blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Echium plantaginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
