    "intro": "Eleutherococcus giraldii var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy eleuthero, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, dark green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. This variant is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities in horticulture."
