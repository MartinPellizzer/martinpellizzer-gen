    "intro": "Erythrina mysorensis, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree also plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
