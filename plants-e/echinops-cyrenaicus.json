    "intro": "Echinops cyrenaicus, commonly known as the Cyprus thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are grey-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops cyrenaicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
