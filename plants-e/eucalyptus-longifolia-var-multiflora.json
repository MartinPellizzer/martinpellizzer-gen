    "intro": "Eucalyptus longifolia var. multiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
