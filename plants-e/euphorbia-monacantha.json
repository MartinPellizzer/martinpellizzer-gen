    "intro": "Euphorbia monacantha, commonly known as the Monacan Thornplant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in spiny, cylindrical tubercles, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its sharp spines and toxic sap, it is often grown as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
