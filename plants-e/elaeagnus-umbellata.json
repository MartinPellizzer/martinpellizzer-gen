    "intro": "Elaeagnus umbellata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Silverberry is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil with nutrients."
