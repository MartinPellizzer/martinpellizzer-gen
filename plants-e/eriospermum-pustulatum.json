    "intro": "Eriospermum pustulatum, commonly known as the woolly eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive woolly, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique leaf structure helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Eriospermum pustulatum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
