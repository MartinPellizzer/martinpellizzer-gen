    "intro": "Epidendrum tovarense, commonly known as the Tovarense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Epidendraceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and inflorescence. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, making it suitable for humid, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
