    "intro": "Eucalyptus carnei, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and have also been utilized in modern herbal remedies. Eucalyptus carnei is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
