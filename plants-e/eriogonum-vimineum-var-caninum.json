It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
