It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. The fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
