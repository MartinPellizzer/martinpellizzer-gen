    "intro": "Ebenus reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on very short stalks. Ebenus reticulata thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
