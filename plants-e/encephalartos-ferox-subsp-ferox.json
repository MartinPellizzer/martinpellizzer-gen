    "intro": "Encephalartos ferox subsp. ferox, commonly known as the Natal knobbed pine, is a rare and highly ornamental cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of long, arching leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
