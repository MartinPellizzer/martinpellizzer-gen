    "intro": "Epidendrum sellowii, commonly known as the Sellow's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and can be either grass-like or succulent in texture. Epidendrum sellowii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
