    "intro": "Erythrina sacleuxii, commonly known as the flame tree or the red flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often giving the plant a fiery appearance. The plant has compound leaves composed of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods are elongated and woody. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina sacleuxii plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
