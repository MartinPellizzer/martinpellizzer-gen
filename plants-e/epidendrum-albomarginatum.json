    "intro": "Epidendrum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive white margin, blooming in clusters during the rainy season. Epidendrum albomarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
