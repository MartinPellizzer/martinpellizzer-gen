It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant has a compact growth habit with deeply lobed, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
