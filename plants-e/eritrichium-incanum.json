    "intro": "Eritrichium incanum, commonly known as the hoary erythronium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Eritrichium incanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with cool, humid conditions."
