    "intro": "Eriocaulon vamanae, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Eriocaulon vamanae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
