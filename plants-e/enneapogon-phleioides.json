    "intro": "Enneapogon phleioides, commonly known as the red grass or red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown, which are a key feature for identification. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Enneapogon phleioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
