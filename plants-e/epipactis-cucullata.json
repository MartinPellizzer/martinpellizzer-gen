It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a unique hooded shape that protects the reproductive structures.
