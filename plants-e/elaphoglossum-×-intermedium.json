    "intro": "Elaphoglossum \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate holly fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Elaphoglossum crenulatum and Elaphoglossum tamariscinum. It is a small to medium-sized fern with delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a finely divided structure. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait in the Elaphoglossum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
