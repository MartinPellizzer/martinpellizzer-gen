It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread across its native habitat."
