    "intro": "Eustachys latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, slender flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, rhizomes, and seed heads that produce small, three-lobed seeds. Eustachys latifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
