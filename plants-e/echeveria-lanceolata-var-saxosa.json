    "intro": "Echeveria lanceolata var. saxosa, commonly known as the Rock Echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with pinkish-purple flowers in the spring. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
