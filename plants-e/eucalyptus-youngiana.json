    "intro": "Eucalyptus youngiana, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish-green color beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-gray hue. Eucalyptus youngiana is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
