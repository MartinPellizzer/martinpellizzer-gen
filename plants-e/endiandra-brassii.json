    "intro": "Endiandra brassii, commonly known as the Australian blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic timber, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a dense canopy that provides shade. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Endiandra brassii is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
