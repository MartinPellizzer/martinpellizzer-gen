    "intro": "Ephedra aphylla, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced or absent. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Ephedra aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick cuticle and ability to store water in its stems."
