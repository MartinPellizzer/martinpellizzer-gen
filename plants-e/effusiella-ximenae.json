    "intro": "Effusiella ximenae, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and striking night-blooming plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at dusk. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its flowers typically close by morning, and it produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds. Effusiella ximenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
