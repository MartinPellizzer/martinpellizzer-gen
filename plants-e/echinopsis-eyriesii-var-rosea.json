    "intro": "Echinopsis eyriesii var. rosea, commonly known as the Pink Hedgehog Cactus, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in soft, pink spines that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
