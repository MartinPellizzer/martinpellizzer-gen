    "intro": "Elymus racemosus var. sabulosus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces airy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
