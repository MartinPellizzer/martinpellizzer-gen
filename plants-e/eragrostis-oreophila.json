    "intro": "Eragrostis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
