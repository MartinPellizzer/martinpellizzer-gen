    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. pseudosilvaticum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, known for its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of horsetails. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions."
