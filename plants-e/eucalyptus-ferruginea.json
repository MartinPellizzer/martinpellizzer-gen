    "intro": "Eucalyptus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty box gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to reddish-brown, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel. Eucalyptus ferruginea plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
