    "intro": "Excoecaria obovata, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Excoecaria obovata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
