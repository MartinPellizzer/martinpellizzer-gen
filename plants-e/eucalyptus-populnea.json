    "intro": "Eucalyptus populnea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet tree, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus populnea is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems."
