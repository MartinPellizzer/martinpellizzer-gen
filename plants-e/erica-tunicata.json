    "intro": "Erica tunicata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica tunicata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
