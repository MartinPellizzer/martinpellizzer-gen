    "intro": "Echinocereus candicans, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinocereus candicans is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
