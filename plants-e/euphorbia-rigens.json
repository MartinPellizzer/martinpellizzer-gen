    "intro": "Euphorbia rigens, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Euphorbia rigens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
