    "intro": "Eriophorum latifolium var. viridicarinatum, commonly known as the green-fringed cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white flower heads that resemble cotton, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often tinged with green or reddish hues. This variety is distinguished by its greenish margins on the bracts, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of tundra and subarctic ecosystems."
