    "intro": "Echinocereus octacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
