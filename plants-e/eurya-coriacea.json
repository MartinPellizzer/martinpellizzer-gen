    "intro": "Eurya coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf waxleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Eurya coriacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
