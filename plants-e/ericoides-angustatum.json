    "intro": "Ericoides angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides angustatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
