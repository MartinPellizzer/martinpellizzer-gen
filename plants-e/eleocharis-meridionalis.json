    "intro": "Eleocharis meridionalis, commonly known as the southern spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by dark, cylindrical spikelets that mature into dry, persistent fruits. Eleocharis meridionalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
