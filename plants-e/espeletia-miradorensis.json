    "intro": "Espeletia miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador Mountain heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Espeletia miradorensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment."
