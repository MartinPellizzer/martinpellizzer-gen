    "intro": "Eleocharis confervoides, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats across North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystem health. Eleocharis confervoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
