    "intro": "Erysimum asperulum, commonly known as the rough wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum asperulum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
