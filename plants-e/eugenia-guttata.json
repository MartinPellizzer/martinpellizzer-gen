    "intro": "Eugenia guttata, commonly known as the spotted eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have distinctive red or purple spots. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when mature. Eugenia guttata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
