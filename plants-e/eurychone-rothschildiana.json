    "intro": "Eurychone rothschildiana, commonly known as Rothschild's eurychone, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its vivid purple to blue flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
