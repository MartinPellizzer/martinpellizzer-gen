    "intro": "Enekbatus bounites, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features feathery, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, golden-green powdery coating, which helps reflect excess sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor, often forming dense mats. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
