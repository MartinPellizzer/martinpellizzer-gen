    "intro": "Elymus mutabilis var. praecaespitosus, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
