    "intro": "Epicharis speciosa, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, adorned with vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid climates. Epicharis speciosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
