    "intro": "Ethanium pacoseroca, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology includes elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Ethanium pacoseroca is considered a vulnerable species."
