    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spongophyllum, commonly known as the sponge fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum spongophyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
