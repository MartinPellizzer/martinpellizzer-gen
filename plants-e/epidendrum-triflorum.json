    "intro": "Epidendrum triflorum, commonly known as the Three-Flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically produces three flowers per spike, which bloom sequentially, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum triflorum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
