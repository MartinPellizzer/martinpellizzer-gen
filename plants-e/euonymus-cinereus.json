    "intro": "Euonymus cinereus, commonly known as the silver euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal three winged seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus cinereus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
