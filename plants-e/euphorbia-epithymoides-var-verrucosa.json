    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides var. verrucosa, commonly known as the\u75a3\u72b6 euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a specialized structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its spiny and sometimes toxic nature, it requires careful handling."
