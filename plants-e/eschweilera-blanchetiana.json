    "intro": "Eschweilera blanchetiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has large, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
