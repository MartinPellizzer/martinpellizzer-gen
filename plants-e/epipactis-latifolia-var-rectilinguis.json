    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. rectilinguis, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The varietal form rectilinguis is distinguished by its elongated, straight lateral sepals compared to the typical form."
