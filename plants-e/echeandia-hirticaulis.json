    "intro": "Echeandia hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed echeandia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
