    "intro": "Eulophia gracillima, commonly known as the slender eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, raceme-like inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in its natural habitat. Eulophia gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
