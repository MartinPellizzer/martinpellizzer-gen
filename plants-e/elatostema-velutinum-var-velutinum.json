    "intro": "Elatostema velutinum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet leaf stellaria, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides."
