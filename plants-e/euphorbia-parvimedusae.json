    "intro": "Euphorbia parvimedusae, commonly known as the miniature spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
