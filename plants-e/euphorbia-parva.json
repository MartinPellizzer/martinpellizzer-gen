    "intro": "Euphorbia parva, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, upright stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia parva is succulent and stores water in its leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
