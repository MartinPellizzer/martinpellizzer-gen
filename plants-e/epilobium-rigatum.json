    "intro": "Epilobium rigatum, commonly known as rigid willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are rigid and often reddish in color. Epilobium rigatum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich environments."
