    "intro": "Effusiella tabacina, commonly known as the tobacco leaf fungus, is a saprophytic fungus that grows on decaying plant material, particularly on tobacco leaves. It belongs to the family Microascaceae and is characterized by its dense, cottony growth pattern. The fungus produces small, rounded, blackish fruiting bodies known as pycnidia, which are often embedded in the host tissue. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions where tobacco cultivation is common. Effusiella tabacina plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter but can also be a contaminant in tobacco products."
