    "intro": "Epilobium gracilipes, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in elongated inflorescences. Epilobium gracilipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
