It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils."
