    "intro": "Epidendrum calyptratoides, commonly known as the calyptrate epidendrum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Epidendrum calyptratoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
