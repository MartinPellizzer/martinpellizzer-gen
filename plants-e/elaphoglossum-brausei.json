    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brausei, commonly known as the Brause's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum brausei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
