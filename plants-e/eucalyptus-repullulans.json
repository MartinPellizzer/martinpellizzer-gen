    "intro": "Eucalyptus repullulans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus repullulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in native landscapes."
