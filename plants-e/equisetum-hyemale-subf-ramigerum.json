    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subf. ramigerum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, abrasive silica. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems produce both sterile and fertile shoots. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
