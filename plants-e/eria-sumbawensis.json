    "intro": "Eria sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, slender stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall graceful appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria sumbawensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
