    "intro": "Echinospermum deflexum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny pome, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Echinospermum deflexum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
