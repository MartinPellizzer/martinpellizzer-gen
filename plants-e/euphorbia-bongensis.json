    "intro": "Euphorbia bongensis, commonly known as the Bong's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the spurge genus. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among many Euphorbia species. Euphorbia bongensis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
