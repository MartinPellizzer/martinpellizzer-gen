    "intro": "Euphorbia megalatlantica subsp. briquetii, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a compact form that helps reduce water loss. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
