    "intro": "Euphorbia firma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The sap of Euphorbia firma is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling the plant."
