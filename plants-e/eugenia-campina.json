    "intro": "Eugenia campina, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
