    "intro": "Epilobium cylindricum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Epilobium cylindricum is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
