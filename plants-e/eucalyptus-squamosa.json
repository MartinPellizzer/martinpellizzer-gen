    "intro": "Eucalyptus squamosa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with smooth, greyish bark on younger trunks. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue. This species is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its natural habitat and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
