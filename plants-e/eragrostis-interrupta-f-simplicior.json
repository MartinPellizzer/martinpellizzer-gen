    "intro": "Eragrostis interrupta f. simplicior, commonly known as the simple eriochloa, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, preferring full sun and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often pubescent, giving the plant a slightly hairy appearance. This subspecies is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
