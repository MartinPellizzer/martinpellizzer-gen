    "intro": "Euonymus alatus, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive winged stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant. Euonymus alatus is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
