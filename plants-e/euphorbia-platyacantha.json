    "intro": "Euphorbia platyacantha, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
