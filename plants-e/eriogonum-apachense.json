    "intro": "Eriogonum apachense, commonly known as the Apache milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Eriogonum apachense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
