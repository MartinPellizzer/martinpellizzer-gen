It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Erica rostella is evergreen, with dense, leathery leaves that help it conserve water. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth and attractive foliage."
