    "intro": "Euphorbia commiphoroides, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. The plant also contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin."
