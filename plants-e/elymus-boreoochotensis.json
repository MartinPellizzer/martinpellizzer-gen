    "intro": "Elymus boreoochotensis, commonly known as the Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus boreoochotensis is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils, often in alpine or subarctic regions. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
