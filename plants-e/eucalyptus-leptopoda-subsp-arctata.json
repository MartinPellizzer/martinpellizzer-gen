    "intro": "Eucalyptus leptopoda subsp. arctata, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slightly rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, followed by woody capsules containing viable seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat."
