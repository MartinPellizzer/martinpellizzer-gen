    "intro": "Echeveria lyonsii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada echeveria, is a succulent native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers during the summer months, typically on stalks that rise above the rosette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Echeveria lyonsii is drought-tolerant and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
