    "intro": "Eragrostis stenostachya, commonly known as slender false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eragrostis stenostachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
