It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
