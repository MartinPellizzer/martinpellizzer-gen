    "intro": "Epidendrum pileatum, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often hairy stems that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a spike-like formation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Epidendrum pileatum is well adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
