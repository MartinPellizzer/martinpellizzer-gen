It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, lowland forests."
