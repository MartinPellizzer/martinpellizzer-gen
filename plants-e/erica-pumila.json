    "intro": "Erica pumila, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
