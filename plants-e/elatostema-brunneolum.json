    "intro": "Elatostema brunneolum, commonly known as the brown-stemmed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features small, rounded leaves with a distinctive reddish or brownish hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Elatostema brunneolum is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not extensively studied."
