    "intro": "Eriothymus, commonly known as hoary vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and they typically grow in dry, rocky, or sandy habitats. Eriothymus species are characterized by their hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are usually trifoliate, consisting of three oval or lance-shaped leaflets. These plants are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
