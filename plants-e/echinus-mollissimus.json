    "intro": "Echinus mollissimus, commonly known as the soft spiny sea urchin, is a marine echinoderm found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its smooth, fleshy body covered in short, soft spines that are typically pale in color. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a globular shape with a central mouth surrounded by five rows of tube feet. Its reproductive system includes both male and female organs, allowing for internal fertilization. Echinus mollissimus plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of algae and serving as prey for various predators."
