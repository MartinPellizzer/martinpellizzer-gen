    "intro": "Echinopsis uyupampensis, commonly known as the Uyupampa cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Peru. It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of white spines. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
