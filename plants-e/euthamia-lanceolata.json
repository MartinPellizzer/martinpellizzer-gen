    "intro": "Euthamia lanceolata, commonly known as slender goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It blooms in late summer to early fall, producing copious amounts of nectar that attract various pollinators. Euthamia lanceolata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
