    "intro": "Epilobium nivale var. lignosum, commonly known as the snow willow, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
