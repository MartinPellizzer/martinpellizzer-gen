    "intro": "Encholirium belemii, commonly known as the Belem giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the humid forests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Encholirium belemii is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
