    "intro": "Echinocereus toroweapensis, commonly known as the Toroweap cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Echinocereus toroweapensis is often found growing on rocky soils and in crevices, where it can access limited moisture."
