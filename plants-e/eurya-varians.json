    "intro": "Eurya varians, commonly known as the variable eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
