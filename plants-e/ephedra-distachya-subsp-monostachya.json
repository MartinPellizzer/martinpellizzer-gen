    "intro": "Ephedra distachya subsp. monostachya, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stems that often branch at the base, and its small, scale-like leaves are typically reduced to tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules containing minute seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine, though its use is regulated due to potential toxicity."
