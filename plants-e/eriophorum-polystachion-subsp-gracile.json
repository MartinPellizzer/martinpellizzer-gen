    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-white coating that helps reduce water loss in cold environments. This subspecies is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine organisms."
