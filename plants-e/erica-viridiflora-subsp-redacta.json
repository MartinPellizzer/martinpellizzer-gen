It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that ranges from green to reddish-brown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
