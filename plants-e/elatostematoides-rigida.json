    "intro": "Elatostematoides rigida, commonly known as the rigid elatostema, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Elatostemataceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and can form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its thallus for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Elatostematoides rigida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
