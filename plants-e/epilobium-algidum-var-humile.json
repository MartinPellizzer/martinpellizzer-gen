    "intro": "Epilobium algidum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to white flowers, which are typically arranged in elongated inflorescences. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and frost-resistant physiology."
