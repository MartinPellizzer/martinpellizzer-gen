It typically grows in dry, rocky, or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss. Eragrostis abessinica is often used in traditional agriculture and as a forage plant for livestock."
