    "intro": "Erythroxylum coelophlebium var. grisebachii, commonly known as the gray-leaved copal tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, followed by follicle fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf coloration and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
