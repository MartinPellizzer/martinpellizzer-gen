    "intro": "Elatostema lineolatum var. majus, commonly known as the broad-leaf elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive light green to pale blue coloration due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. The plant produces tiny, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
