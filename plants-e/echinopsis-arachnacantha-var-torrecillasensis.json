    "intro": "Echinopsis arachnacantha var. torrecillasensis, commonly known as the Torrecillas Thorned Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green coloration. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
