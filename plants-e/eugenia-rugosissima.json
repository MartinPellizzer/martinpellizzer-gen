    "intro": "Eugenia rugosissima, commonly known as the rough-leaved myrtle, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, rough-textured bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
