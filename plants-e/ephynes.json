They typically have simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying shades of white or pale yellow. Ephynes are known for their ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
