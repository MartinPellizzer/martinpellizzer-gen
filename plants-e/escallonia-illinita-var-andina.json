It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are thick and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.
