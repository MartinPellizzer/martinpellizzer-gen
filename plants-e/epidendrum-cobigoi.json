    "intro": "Epidendrum cobigoi, commonly known as the Cobigoi orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Epidendrum cobigoi thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
