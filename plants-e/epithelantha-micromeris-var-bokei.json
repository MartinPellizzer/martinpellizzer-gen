    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. bokei, commonly known as the Bokei cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
