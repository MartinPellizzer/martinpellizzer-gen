    "intro": "Eremopyrum orientale, commonly known as the oriental eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eremopyrum orientale produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
