    "intro": "Euphorbia szovitsii var. kharputensis, commonly known as the Kharput euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Syria. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
