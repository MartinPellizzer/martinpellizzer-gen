    "intro": "Ephemerantha appendiculata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in the wet, shaded environments of cypress swamps and pine flatwoods, often growing on the trunks of trees. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its modified stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of greenish-white tissue. Its flowers, which bloom briefly in late summer, are pale green with a distinctive white or pale pink hue. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
