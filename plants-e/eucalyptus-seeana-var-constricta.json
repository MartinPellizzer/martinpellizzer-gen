    "intro": "Eucalyptus seeana var. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species. This variety is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
