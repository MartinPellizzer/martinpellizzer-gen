    "intro": "Ericoides turgidum, commonly known as the swollen heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact foliage. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides turgidum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions."
