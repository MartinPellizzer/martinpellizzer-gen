    "intro": "Euphorbia hassleriana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Euphorbia hassleriana thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
