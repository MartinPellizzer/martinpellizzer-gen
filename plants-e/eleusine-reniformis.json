    "intro": "Eleusine reniformis, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often ribbed and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
