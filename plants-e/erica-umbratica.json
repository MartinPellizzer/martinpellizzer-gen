    "intro": "Erica umbratica, commonly known as the shade-loving heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. Erica umbratica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
