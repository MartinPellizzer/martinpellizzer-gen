    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. elatum, commonly known as the tall field horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant characterized by its taller growth habit compared to other equisetum species. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, often disturbed soils, such as those found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant features a distinct stem covered in whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically green to yellowish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and appear at the top of the stem, containing sporangia that release spores. This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
