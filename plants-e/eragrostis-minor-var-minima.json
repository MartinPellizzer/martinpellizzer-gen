    "intro": "Eragrostis minor var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf weeping grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features slender, hair-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth habit, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form a compact, tidy foliage."
