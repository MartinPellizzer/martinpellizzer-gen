    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brassii, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing in dense undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
