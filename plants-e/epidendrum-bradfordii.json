    "intro": "Epidendrum bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradford's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces numerous racemes of flowers during the growing season. Epidendrum bradfordii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
