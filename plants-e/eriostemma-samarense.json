    "intro": "Eriostemma samarense, commonly known as the Samarenses eriostem, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriostemma samarense is considered a rare and endangered species."
