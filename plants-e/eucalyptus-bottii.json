    "intro": "Eucalyptus bottii, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, which appear in clusters during the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and it is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands. Eucalyptus bottii is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance to Indigenous Australians."
