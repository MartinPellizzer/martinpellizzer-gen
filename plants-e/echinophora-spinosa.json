    "intro": "Echinophora spinosa, commonly known as the spiny echinophora, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny conditions. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in dense, spherical heads, and bloom in the spring. Echinophora spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
