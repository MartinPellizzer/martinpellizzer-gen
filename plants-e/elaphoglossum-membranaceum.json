    "intro": "Elaphoglossum membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous harts-tongue fern, is a delicate, small fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching fronds with a finely divided, feathery appearance, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its delicate foliage and unique morphology make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
