    "intro": "Eriosyce eriosyzoides subsp. atroviridis, commonly known as the green-tipped rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to greenish woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
