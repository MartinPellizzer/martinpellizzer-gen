    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus var. andinus, commonly known as the Andean wild rye, is a grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, blue-green foliage, which are adapted to the harsh, cold, and high-altitude conditions of its habitat. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
