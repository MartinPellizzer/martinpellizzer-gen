    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus turbiniformis, commonly known as the Turbiniform Echinofossulocactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, ribbed spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
