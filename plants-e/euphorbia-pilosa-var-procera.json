    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. procera, commonly known as the tall spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
