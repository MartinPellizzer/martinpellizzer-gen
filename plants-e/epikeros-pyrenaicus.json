    "intro": "Epikeros pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Epikeros pyrenaicus is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
