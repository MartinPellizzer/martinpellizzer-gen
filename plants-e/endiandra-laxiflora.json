    "intro": "Endiandra laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered endiandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forest regrowth. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
