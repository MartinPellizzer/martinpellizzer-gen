    "intro": "Elatostema lignosum, commonly known as the creeping snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, commonly known as the nettle family, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Elatostema lignosum is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in providing habitat for small invertebrates."
