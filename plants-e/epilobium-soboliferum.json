    "intro": "Epilobium soboliferum, commonly known as the woolly willow or redstem willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. Epilobium soboliferum is typically found in moist habitats like stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
