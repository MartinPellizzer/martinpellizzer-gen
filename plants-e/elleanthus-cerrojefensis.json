    "intro": "Elleanthus cerrojefensis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related genera. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. Elleanthus cerrojefensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
