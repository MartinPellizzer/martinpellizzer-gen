    "intro": "Eugenia cotinifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by showy, violet-blue berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
