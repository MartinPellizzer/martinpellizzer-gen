It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, especially in autumn. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods.
