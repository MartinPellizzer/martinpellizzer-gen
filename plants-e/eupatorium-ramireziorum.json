    "intro": "Eupatorium ramireziorum, commonly known as Ramirez's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
