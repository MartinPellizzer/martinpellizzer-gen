    "intro": "Epidendrum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum acutifolium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
