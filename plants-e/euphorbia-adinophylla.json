    "intro": "Euphorbia adinophylla, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
