    "intro": "Exostigma, commonly known as the shield-like structure found on the lower surface of some fern fronds. It is a specialized, hardened tissue that provides structural support and protection to the leaf blade. The exostigma is composed of thickened, lignified cells that form a rigid layer. It plays a role in reducing water loss and enhancing the mechanical strength of the frond. This feature is particularly prominent in certain species of water ferns and is an adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
