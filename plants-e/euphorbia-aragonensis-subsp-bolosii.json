    "intro": "Euphorbia aragonensis subsp. bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent gardens."
