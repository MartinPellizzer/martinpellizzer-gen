    "intro": "Euphorbia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia johnstonii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
