    "intro": "Eleocharis congesta subsp. subvivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences and small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas. One notable botanical feature is its vivipary, where some inflorescences produce mature, viable seeds while still attached to the parent plant. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
