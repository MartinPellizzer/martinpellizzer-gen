    "intro": "Edwinia macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered edwinia, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Edwinia macrocalyx is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
