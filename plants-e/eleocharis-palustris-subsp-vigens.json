    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. vigens, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale brown flowers. This subspecies typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
