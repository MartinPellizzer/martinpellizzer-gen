    "intro": "Erodium maculatum, commonly known as crimson bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces tiny, bead-like fruits called eliares. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Erodium maculatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
