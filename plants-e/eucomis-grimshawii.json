    "intro": "Eucomis grimshawii, commonly known as the African fountain grass, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems with whorled, grass-like leaves that give it a unique, fountain-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white to pale blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its architectural form and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for modern landscape designs."
