    "intro": "Euphorbia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia saxatilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
