    "intro": "Epicycas micholitzii, commonly known as the Micholitz's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, dark green bark, and it produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its cones are typically small and inconspicuous, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Epicycas micholitzii is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
