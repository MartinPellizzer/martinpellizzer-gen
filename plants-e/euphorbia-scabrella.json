    "intro": "Euphorbia scabrella, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Euphorbia scabrella is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
