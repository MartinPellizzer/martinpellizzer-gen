    "intro": "Eugenia piedadensis, commonly known as the Piedad guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andes region of Colombia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
