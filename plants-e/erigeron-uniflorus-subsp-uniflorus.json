    "intro": "Erigeron uniflorus subsp. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is distinguished by its single, prominent flower per stem, setting it apart from other members of the genus."
