    "intro": "Exostema velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
