    "intro": "Epilobium glabellum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium glabellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
