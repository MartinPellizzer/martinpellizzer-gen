    "intro": "Echinocactus parviflorus var. havasupaiensis, commonly known as the Havasupai Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States. It features a globular shape with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
