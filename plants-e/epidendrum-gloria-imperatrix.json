    "intro": "Epidendrum gloria-imperatrix, commonly known as the Imperial Glory Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a striking addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
