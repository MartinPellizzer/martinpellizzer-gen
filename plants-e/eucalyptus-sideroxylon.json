    "intro": "Eucalyptus sideroxylon, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions."
