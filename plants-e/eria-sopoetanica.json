    "intro": "Eria sopoetanica, commonly known as the Sopoetan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sopoeta. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eria sopoetanica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
