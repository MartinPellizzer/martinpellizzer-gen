    "intro": "Eremopanax schlechteri f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender eremopanax, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
