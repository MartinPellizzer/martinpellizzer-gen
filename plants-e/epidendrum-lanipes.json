It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, bloom in spring and summer, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
