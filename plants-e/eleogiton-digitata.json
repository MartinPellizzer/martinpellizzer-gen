    "intro": "Eleogiton digitata, commonly known as the slender thornapple, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Eleogiton digitata is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
