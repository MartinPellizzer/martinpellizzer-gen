    "intro": "Euphorbia thymifolia var. suffrutescens, commonly known as the fragrant euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
