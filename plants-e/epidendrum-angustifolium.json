    "intro": "Epidendrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
