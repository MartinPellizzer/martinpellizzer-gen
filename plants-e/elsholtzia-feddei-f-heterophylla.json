    "intro": "Elsholtzia feddei f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, but the varietal form heterophylla exhibits variation in leaf shape and size. The small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and are clustered in dense spikes, making it an attractive plant for alpine gardens."
