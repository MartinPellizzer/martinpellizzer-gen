It is characterized by its striking orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, bright red seeds. Euonymus orgyalis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
