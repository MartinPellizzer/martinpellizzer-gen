    "intro": "Echeveria debilis, commonly known as the \"Baby Toes,\" is a succulent native to Mexico. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink to lavender flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
