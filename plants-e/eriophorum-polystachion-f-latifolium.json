    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton grass, is a variant of the cotton grass species characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. This subspecies is often found in northern regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
