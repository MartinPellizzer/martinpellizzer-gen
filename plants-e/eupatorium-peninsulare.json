    "intro": "Eupatorium peninsulare, commonly known as Florida boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist habitats. It is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
