    "intro": "Elymus antarcticus, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus antarcticus is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
