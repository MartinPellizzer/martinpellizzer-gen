It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis thermalis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, water-saturated soils. Its presence often indicates stable, undisturbed wetland habitats."
