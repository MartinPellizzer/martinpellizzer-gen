    "intro": "Eucalyptus populnea var. obconica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, typically during the cooler months. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
