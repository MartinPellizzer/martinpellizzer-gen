    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tarbacense, commonly known as the Tarbacense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Elaphoglossum tarbacense is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
