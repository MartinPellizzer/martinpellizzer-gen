    "intro": "Euthemis ciliata, commonly known as the silky euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often covered with a waxy coating. Euthemis ciliata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
