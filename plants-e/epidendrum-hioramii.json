It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically features long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Epidendrum hioramii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
