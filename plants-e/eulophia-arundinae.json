    "intro": "Eulophia arundinae, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Eulophia arundinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
