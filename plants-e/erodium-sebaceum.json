    "intro": "Erodium sebaceum, commonly known as sticky weed or sandspurry, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, sandy environments. Erodium sebaceum is commonly considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
