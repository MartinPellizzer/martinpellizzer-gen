It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species for arid landscapes. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for native pollinators and shelter for small fauna."
