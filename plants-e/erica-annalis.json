    "intro": "Erica annalis, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica annalis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
