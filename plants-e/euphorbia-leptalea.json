    "intro": "Euphorbia leptalea, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in soft, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling this plant."
