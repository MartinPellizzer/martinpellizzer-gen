    "intro": "Euphorbia stenocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that is often branched and covered in small, greenish-yellow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivating."
