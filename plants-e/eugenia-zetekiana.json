    "intro": "Eugenia zetekiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
