It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late summer. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
