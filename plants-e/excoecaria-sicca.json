    "intro": "Excoecaria sicca, commonly known as the Natal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, with five petals and a prominent yellow center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Excoecaria sicca is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and is often found in coastal and woodland areas."
