It features erect stems covered in coarse, stiff hairs, and its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.

The plant's botanical characteristics make it valuable in agricultural systems and ecological restoration projects."
