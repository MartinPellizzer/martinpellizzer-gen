    "intro": "Eucalyptus apocynifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its bark is often flaky and peels in strips, a common feature among many eucalyptus species. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
