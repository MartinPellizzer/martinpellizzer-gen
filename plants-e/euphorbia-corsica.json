    "intro": "Euphorbia corsica, commonly known as the Corsican spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Euphorbia corsica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
