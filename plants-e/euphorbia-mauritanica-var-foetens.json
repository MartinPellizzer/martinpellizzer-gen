    "intro": "Euphorbia mauritanica var. foetens, commonly known as the stinking euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and can tolerate drought conditions. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
