It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
