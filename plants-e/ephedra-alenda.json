    "intro": "Ephedra alenda, commonly known as the desert tea, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Ephedra alenda contains ephedrine, a compound with historical use in traditional medicine. However, due to its potential toxicity and legal restrictions, it is not widely used in modern herbal practices."
