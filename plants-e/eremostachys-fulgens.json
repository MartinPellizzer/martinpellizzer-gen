It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
