    "intro": "Eryngium multifidum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eryngium multifidum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
