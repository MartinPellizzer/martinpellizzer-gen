    "intro": "Elcismia campbellensis, commonly known as Campbell's elcismia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense canopy cover in lowland forests. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Elcismia campbellensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
