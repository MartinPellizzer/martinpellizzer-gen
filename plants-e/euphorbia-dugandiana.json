    "intro": "Euphorbia dugandiana, commonly known as the Dugand's spurges, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by colorful bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia dugandiana is also noted for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its resilience to drought."
