    "intro": "Euphorbia macgillivrayi, commonly known as the Macgillivray's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, branching stem covered in soft, green, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
