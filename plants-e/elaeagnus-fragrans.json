    "intro": "Elaeagnus fragrans, commonly known as silver leaf elaeagnus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible, nut-like fruits that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid regions. Elaeagnus fragrans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
