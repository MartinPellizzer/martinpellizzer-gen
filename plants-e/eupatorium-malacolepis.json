    "intro": "Eupatorium malacolepis, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant produces small, white to yellow florets surrounded by a series of bracts that form a conical shape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, rich soils in woodland areas. Eupatorium malacolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
