    "intro": "Euphorbia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Euphorbia guatemalensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
