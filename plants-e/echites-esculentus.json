    "intro": "Echites esculentus, commonly known as the edible thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces distinctive, egg-shaped fruits that contain seeds embedded in a gelatinous pulp. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a hairy texture. While the fruit is edible, the plant contains toxic compounds, so it must be handled with care."
