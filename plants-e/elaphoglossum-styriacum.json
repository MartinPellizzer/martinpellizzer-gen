    "intro": "Elaphoglossum styriacum, commonly known as the Styrian holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum styriacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its refined appearance."
