    "intro": "Elymus littoralis, commonly known as coastal barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in salty, sandy soils along shorelines and is highly tolerant of maritime conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Elymus littoralis is an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
