    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dissitifrons, commonly known as the hairy frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Elaphoglossum dissitifrons is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
