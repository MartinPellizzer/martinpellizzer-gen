    "intro": "Euphorbia radians var. stormiae, commonly known as the Stormaea euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that can develop a reddish or purple hue under bright light. The plant produces vibrant yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its color and shape. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
