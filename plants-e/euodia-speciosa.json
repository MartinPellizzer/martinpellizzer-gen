    "intro": "Euodia speciosa, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood or fragrant ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Euodia speciosa is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional Chinese medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
