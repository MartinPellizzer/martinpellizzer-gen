It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-gray or green in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
