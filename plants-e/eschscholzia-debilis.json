    "intro": "Eschscholzia debilis, commonly known as the slender poppy, is a delicate annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
