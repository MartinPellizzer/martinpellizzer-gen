    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides, commonly known as the \"milkweed tree\" or \"butterfly bush,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. The plant is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
