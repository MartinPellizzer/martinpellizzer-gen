    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus var. brumorviana, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
