    "intro": "Echinochlaenia tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian echinochloa, is a perennial herb native to Tasmania, Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as heathlands and forest margins. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
