    "intro": "Euphrasia subulata, commonly known as the slender eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, sparsely hairy stems and tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and subulate, meaning they are very narrow and taper to a point, giving it a distinctive appearance. Euphrasia subulata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
