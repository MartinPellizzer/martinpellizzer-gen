    "intro": "Equisetum campestre, commonly known as field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing cones. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum campestre is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
