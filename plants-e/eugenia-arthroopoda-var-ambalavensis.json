    "intro": "Eugenia arthroopoda var. ambalavensis, commonly known as the Ambalavensis guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible, sweet-tart berries that are similar in appearance to common guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas of its native habitat. Due to its unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
