It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often trail or climb along the ground or over other plants. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its spore-bearing structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Elaphoglossum scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
