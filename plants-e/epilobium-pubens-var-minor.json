    "intro": "Epilobium pubens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
