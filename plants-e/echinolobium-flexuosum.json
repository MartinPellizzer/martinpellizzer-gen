    "intro": "Echinolobium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible echinolobium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Echinolobium flexuosum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
