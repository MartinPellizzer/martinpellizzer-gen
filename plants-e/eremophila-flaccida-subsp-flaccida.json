    "intro": "Eremophila flaccida subsp. flaccida, commonly known as the sticky hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
