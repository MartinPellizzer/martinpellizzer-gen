    "intro": "Eyrythalia pratensis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features upright, slender stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a reddish tinge, especially along the edges. Eyrythalia pratensis thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
