    "intro": "Eurybia cuneifolia, commonly known as the eastern wood aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, typically in shades of purple and white. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. Eurybia cuneifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering season."
