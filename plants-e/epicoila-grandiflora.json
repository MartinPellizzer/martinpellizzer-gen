    "intro": "Epicoila grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered epicoila, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epicoila grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
