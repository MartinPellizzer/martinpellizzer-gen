    "intro": "Eriophorum virginicum var. confertissimum, commonly known as tussock cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are slender and grass-like, while its flowering stems are short and often hidden within the dense tufts. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist, acidic environments."
