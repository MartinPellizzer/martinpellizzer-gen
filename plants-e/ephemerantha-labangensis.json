    "intro": "Ephemerantha labangensis, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
