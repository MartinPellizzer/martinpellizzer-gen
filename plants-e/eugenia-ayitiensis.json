    "intro": "Eugenia ayitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
