    "intro": "Egleria fluctuans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary vegetative organs. Egleria fluctuans is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladders to trap and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
