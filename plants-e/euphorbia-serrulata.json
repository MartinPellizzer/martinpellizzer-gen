    "intro": "Euphorbia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Euphorbia serrulata is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
