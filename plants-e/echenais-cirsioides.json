    "intro": "Echenais cirsioides, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species in supporting pollinator populations. Echenais cirsioides is often found in disturbed soils and is a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
