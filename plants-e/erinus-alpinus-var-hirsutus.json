    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy erinus, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist harsh weather conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to flourish in challenging garden environments."
