    "intro": "Erica cetrata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica cetrata is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
