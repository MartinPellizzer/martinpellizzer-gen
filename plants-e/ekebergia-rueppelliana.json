    "intro": "Ekebergia rueppelliana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hard, dark wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and musical instrument making."
