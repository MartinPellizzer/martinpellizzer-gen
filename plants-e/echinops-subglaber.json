    "intro": "Echinops subglaber, commonly known as the hairless thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, though the species name \"subglaber\" suggests a reduction in hair compared to other echinops species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
