    "intro": "Elymus arenarius f. cristatus, commonly known as the crested sandgrass, is a variant of the sandgrass species native to arid and coastal regions. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crest-like inflorescence that gives it its unique appearance. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines where it helps stabilize the environment. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and contribute to its ecological significance in sandy habitats."
