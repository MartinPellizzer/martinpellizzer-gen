It typically features slender, prostrate stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
