    "intro": "Eleocharis major, commonly known as spike rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed seeds. Eleocharis major plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
