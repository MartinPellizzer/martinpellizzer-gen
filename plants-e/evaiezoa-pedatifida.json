    "intro": "Evaiezoa pedatifida, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmately divided leaves. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
