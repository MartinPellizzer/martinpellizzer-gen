    "intro": "Euphorbia eranthes, commonly known as the early euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant belongs to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. It typically blooms in early spring, making it one of the first plants to flower in its habitat. Euphorbia eranthes thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands or rocky areas."
