    "intro": "Eriocaulon truncatum, commonly known as the truncate sedge, is a small perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Eriocaulon truncatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
