    "intro": "Eleocharis steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface, and it often forms dense stands in its habitat. Eleocharis steyermarkii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
