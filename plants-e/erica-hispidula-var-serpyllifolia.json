It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has wiry, hairy stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, compact ground cover."
