    "intro": "Echinops ossicus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Echinops ossicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
