    "intro": "Elaphoglossum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
