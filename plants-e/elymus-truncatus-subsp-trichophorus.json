    "intro": "Elymus truncatus subsp. trichophorus, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and culms that are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
