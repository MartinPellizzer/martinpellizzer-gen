    "intro": "Eutaxia microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eutaxia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
