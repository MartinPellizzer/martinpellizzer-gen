It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
