It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are typically golden in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
