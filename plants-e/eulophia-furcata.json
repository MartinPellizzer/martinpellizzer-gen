It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil, while its leaves are strap-shaped and succulent. Eulophia furcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
