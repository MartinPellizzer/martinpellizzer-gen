    "intro": "Epigynum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean epigynum, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
