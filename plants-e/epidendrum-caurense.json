It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing numerous small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Epidendrum caurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
