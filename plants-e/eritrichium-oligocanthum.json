    "intro": "Eritrichium oligocanthum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Eritrichium oligocanthum is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
