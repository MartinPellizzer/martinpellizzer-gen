    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spiny, tuberculate stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the areoles. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
