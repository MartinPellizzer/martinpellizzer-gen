    "intro": "Espeletia funckii, commonly known as the \"Cumbal\" or \"Andes snow plant,\" is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the center of its foliage, which blooms in the spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the Andes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
