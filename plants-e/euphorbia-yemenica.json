    "intro": "Euphorbia yemenica, commonly known as the Yemen spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Yemen. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces a unique type of inflorescence called a cyathium, which consists of a cup-shaped structure surrounded by modified leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its stems and having a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia yemenica is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
