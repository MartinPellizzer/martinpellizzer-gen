    "intro": "Englerina kagehensis, commonly known as the Kagehense englerina, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
