    "intro": "Elytrigia caespitosa subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, particularly those rich in gypsum. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
