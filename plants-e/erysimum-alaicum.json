    "intro": "Erysimum alaicum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erysimum alaicum is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
