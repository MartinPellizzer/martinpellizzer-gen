    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 percollinum, commonly known as the sticky willow or everlastings, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Epilobium \u00d7 percollinum is known for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
