    "intro": "Epidendrum mojandae, commonly known as the Mojanda Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum mojandae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
