It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves and small, globular flower buds that are typically pink or red in color. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and heathlands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub that plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its aromatic oils have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties."
