    "intro": "Encelia ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Giesbrecht's brittlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Encelia ghiesbreghtii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss."
