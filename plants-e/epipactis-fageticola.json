    "intro": "Epipactis fageticola, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies on forest floors. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Epipactis fageticola is an important component of understory vegetation in temperate forests, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability."
