    "intro": "Eucalyptus megacarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost gum, is a medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in winter. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
