    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. intermixta, commonly known as the variegated milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
