    "intro": "Euphorbia denisiana var. maromokotrensis, commonly known as the Maromokotrensis spurge, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a compact, branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a prized addition to collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and requires careful cultivation."
