    "intro": "Erythroxylum sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has been historically used for its psychoactive properties, though it is not as well-known as other species in the Erythroxylum genus."
