    "intro": "Eragrostis ancashensis, commonly known as the Andean lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
