    "intro": "Euphorbia serpillifolia subsp. serpillifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
