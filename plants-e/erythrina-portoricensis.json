    "intro": "Erythrina portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican coral tree, is a deciduous legume native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that appear in clusters, often with a yellow or orange center. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are typically woody and branched. It produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to coastal and tropical environments, often growing in sandy soils along the shores of Puerto Rico."
