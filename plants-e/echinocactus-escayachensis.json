    "intro": "Echinocactus escayachensis, commonly known as the Escayachense cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
