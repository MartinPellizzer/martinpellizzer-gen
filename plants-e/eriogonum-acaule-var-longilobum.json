    "intro": "Eriogonum acaule var. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, often branched stem that lacks a true stem base, hence its species name \"acaule.\" The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral."
