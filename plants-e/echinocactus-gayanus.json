    "intro": "Echinocactus gayanus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny exterior, which protects it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that allows it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and bloom at the top of the plant. Echinocactus gayanus is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
