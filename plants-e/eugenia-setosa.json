    "intro": "Eugenia setosa, commonly known as the Chilean guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and has glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils. Eugenia setosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in its native habitat."
