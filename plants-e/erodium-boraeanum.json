    "intro": "Erodium boraeanum, commonly known as the Alaskan bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Erodium boraeanum is characterized by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
