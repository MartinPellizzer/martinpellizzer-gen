    "intro": "Eutrema wasabi var. sachalinense, commonly known as Japanese wasabi, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, streamside habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a distinctive, pungent aroma due to the presence of isothiocyanates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant is cultivated for its edible root, which is used in Japanese cuisine. This variety is closely related to the common wasabi (Eutrema wasabi) but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different chemical composition."
