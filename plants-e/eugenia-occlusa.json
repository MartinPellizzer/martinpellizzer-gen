    "intro": "Eugenia occlusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
