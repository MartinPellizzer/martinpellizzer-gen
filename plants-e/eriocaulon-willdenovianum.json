    "intro": "Eriocaulon willdenovianum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant is characterized by its compact stature and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
