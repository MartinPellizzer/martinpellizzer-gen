    "intro": "Eugenia koolauensis var. glabra, commonly known as the Koolau smooth eugenia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories on the windward sides of the islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
