    "intro": "Erinus hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Erinus hispanicus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
