    "intro": "Eragrostis humifusa, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color when fresh. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value in wetland ecosystems."
