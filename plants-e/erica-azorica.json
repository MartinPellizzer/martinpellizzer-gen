    "intro": "Erica azorica, commonly known as the Azores heath, is a flowering plant native to the Azores archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathland and coastal areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica azorica is adapted to the humid and mild climate of the Azores, with its evergreen foliage providing year-round structure. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
