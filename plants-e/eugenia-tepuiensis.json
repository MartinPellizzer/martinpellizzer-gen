    "intro": "Eugenia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui eugenia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes many tropical trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in the unique ecosystems of the tepuis."
