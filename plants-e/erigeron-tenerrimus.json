    "intro": "Erigeron tenerrimus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky plains. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-gray leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
