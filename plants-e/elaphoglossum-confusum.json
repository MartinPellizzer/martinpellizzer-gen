    "intro": "Elaphoglossum confusum, commonly known as the confused holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum confusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
