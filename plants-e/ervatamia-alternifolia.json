    "intro": "Ervatamia alternifolia, commonly known as the desert lavender, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are alternately arranged along the stems. Its showy, violet-blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ervatamia alternifolia is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions."
