    "intro": "Eriophyllum, commonly known as wooly sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly California, and are characterized by their dense, white, woolly foliage. The flowers are typically small and yellow, forming composite heads that resemble daisies. Eriophyllum species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
