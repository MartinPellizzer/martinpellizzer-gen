    "intro": "Eumecanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its stems are often creeping or trailing. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
