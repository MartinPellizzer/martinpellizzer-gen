    "intro": "Erigeron serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy white to pale blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
