It is a perennial herb with upright stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple and are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has hairy leaves and produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
