    "intro": "Epidendrum farfanii, commonly known as the Farfan's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, often pendulous inflorescence and clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum farfanii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
