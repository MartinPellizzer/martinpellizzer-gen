It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its short stature, usually reaching only a few inches in height, and its ability to form dense mats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
