    "intro": "Erica juniperifolia, commonly known as the silver-leaved heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of specialized hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Erica juniperifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and requires minimal water once established."
