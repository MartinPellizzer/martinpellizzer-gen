    "intro": "Eupteris aquilina, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and aquatic environments in Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Eupteris aquilina plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
