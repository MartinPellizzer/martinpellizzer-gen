It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers are typically large and showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Escobedia grandiflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
