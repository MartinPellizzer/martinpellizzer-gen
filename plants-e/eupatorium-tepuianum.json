    "intro": "Eupatorium tepuianum, commonly known as the tepuianum boneset, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its showy, purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
