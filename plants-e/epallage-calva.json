    "intro": "Epallage calva, commonly known as the white-flowered epallage, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces showy, white bracts that resemble petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epallage calva is considered a conservation concern."
