    "intro": "Epidendrum bahorucense, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
