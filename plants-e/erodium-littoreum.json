    "intro": "Erodium littoreum, commonly known as seaside bird's-beak, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Erodium littoreum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
