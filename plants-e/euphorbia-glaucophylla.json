    "intro": "Euphorbia glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain irritants."
