    "intro": "Esula biumbellata, commonly known as the twin-antlered fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its leaves are bi-lobed, with each lobe resembling a small antler, giving the plant its distinctive name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Esula biumbellata produces spores rather than seeds, reproducing through asexual means. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
