    "intro": "Epidendrum coryophorum, commonly known as the \"Coryphorum Epidendrum,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to light pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Epidendrum coryophorum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
