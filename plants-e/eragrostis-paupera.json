    "intro": "Eragrostis paupera, commonly known as poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
