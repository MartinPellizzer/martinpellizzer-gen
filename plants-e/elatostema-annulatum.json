    "intro": "Elatostema annulatum, commonly known as the ring-leaved stellaria, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, succulent leaves. The leaves are often arranged in a rosette and are covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. This plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
