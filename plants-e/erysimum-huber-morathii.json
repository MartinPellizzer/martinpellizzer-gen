    "intro": "Erysimum huber-morathii, commonly known as the Morath's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
