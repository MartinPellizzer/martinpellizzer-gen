    "intro": "Elaphoglossum caudulatum, commonly known as the long-tailed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Americas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum caudulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
