    "intro": "Ehretia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests or near riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in traditional medicine."
