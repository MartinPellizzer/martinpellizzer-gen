    "intro": "Elatostema falcatum, commonly known as the creeping arrowleaf, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Elatostema falcatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common ground cover in tropical and subtropical regions."
