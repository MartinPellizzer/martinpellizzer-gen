    "intro": "Euphorbia eremophila var. microdendron, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique, spiky inflorescences that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a rock garden or container plant."
