    "intro": "Epilobium montanum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the mountain willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated margin. Its flowers are small, pink to reddish-purple, and are arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous terrains."
