    "intro": "Eriogonum ericifolium subsp. pulchrum, commonly known as the showy buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
