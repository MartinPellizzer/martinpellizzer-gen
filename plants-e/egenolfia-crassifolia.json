It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, thick, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Egenolfia crassifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
