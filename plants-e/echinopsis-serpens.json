    "intro": "Echinopsis serpens, commonly known as the snake cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at night. Echinopsis serpens is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
