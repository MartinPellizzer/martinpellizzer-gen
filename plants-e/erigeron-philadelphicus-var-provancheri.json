    "intro": "Erigeron philadelphicus var. provancheri, commonly known as the Philadelphia fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its slender stems and finely divided leaves contribute to its delicate appearance, while its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Erigeron philadelphicus."
