    "intro": "Esula riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along rivers and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Esula riparia plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it a key component of floodplain ecosystems."
