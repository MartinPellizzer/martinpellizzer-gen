    "intro": "Euphorbia segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia segoviensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
