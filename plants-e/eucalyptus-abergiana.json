    "intro": "Eucalyptus abergiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its timber is hard and durable, making it valuable for local use. Eucalyptus abergiana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
