    "intro": "Eryngium horridum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by stiff, bristly leaves. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Eryngium horridum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appearance and attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
