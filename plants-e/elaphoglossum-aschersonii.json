    "intro": "Elaphoglossum aschersonii, commonly known as the Ascherson's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Elaphoglossum aschersonii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
