    "intro": "Eriosyce napina subsp. challensis, commonly known as the Challeng's rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
