It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
