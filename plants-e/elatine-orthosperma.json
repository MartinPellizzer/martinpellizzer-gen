    "intro": "Elatine orthosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Elatine orthosperma is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
