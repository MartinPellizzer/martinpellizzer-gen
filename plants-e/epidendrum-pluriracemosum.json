    "intro": "Epidendrum pluriracemosum, commonly known as the many-branched epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is usually dark green and waxy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Epidendrum pluriracemosum is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and garden displays due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
