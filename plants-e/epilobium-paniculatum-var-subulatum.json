    "intro": "Epilobium paniculatum var. subulatum, commonly known as the slender willow herb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and its clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It is often found in high elevation areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The slender willow herb is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
