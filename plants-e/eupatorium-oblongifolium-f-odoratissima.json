    "intro": "Eupatorium oblongifolium f. odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its foliage emits a strong, spicy scent, which is most noticeable when crushed, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a habitat for various pollinators."
