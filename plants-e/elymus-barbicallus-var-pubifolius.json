    "intro": "Elymus barbicallus var. pubifolius, commonly known as the pubifoliate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow, hairy, and have a bluish-green hue, which helps distinguish it from other grasses. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
