    "intro": "Eupatorium fraternum, commonly known as swamp eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, swampy areas and has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy white to pinkish flowers bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium fraternum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
