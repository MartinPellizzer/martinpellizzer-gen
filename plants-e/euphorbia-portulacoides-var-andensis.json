    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. andensis, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
