    "intro": "Euphorbia pfeilii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive branched stem structure that resembles a candlestick, with a thick, fleshy trunk and branching arms. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, spine-tipped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia pfeilii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its stems and exhibiting a slow growth rate to conserve resources."
