    "intro": "Euphorbia golondrina, commonly known as the \"dove's milk\" or \"white spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. It is noted for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia golondrina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
