It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.
