    "intro": "Eugenia chiquitensis var. chiquitensis, commonly known as the Chiquit\u00e1n myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
