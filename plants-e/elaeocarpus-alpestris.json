    "intro": "Elaeocarpus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
