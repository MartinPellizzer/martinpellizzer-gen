    "intro": "Erigeron hyperboreus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the Arctic Blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale florets, which set it apart from other forms of Erigeron hyperboreus."
