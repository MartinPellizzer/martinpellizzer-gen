    "intro": "Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium, commonly known as the longleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in globular inflorescences, which are typical of the genus Eriogonum. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to other varieties of Eriogonum longifolium."
