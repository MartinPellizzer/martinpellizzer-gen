    "intro": "Echinops lepetymnicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, gray-green with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or arid environments. Echinops lepetymnicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
