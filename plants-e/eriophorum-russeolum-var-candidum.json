    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum var. candidum, commonly known as the white tussock grass, is a variant of the tussock grass that is characterized by its pale, almost white inflorescence. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America, particularly in wetland and bog environments. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with long, slender leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within the fluffy, white bracts. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The white tussock grass is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
