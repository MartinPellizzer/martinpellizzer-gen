    "intro": "Eurya boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eurya boliviensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
