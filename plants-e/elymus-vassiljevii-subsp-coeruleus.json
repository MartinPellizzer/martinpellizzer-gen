    "intro": "Elymus vassiljevii subsp. coeruleus, commonly known as blue wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
