It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat."
