    "intro": "Eugenia smaragdina var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf green eugenia, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of culinary ingredients. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
