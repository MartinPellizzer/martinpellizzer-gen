    "intro": "Eucalyptus apodophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in winter and early spring. Its flowers are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic, oval-shaped seeds. Eucalyptus apodophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
