    "intro": "Epipactis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its sticky secretions on the petals and leaves are thought to aid in pollination by attracting specific insects. Epipactis viscosa is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm."
