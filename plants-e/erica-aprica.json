    "intro": "Erica aprica, commonly known as the winter heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter and early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica aprica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
