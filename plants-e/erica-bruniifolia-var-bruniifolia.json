    "intro": "Erica bruniifolia var. bruniifolia, commonly known as the Bruniifolia heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the late winter to early spring season. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and naturalized areas."
