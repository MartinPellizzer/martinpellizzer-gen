    "intro": "Echites isthmicus, commonly known as the Isthmus cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Isthmus of Panama. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
