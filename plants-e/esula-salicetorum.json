    "intro": "Esula salicetorum, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Esula salicetorum is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
