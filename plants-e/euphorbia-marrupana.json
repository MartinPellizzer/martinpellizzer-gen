    "intro": "Euphorbia marrupana, commonly known as the Marrupana spurge, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. Its leaves are usually alternate and may be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety. Euphorbia marrupana is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
