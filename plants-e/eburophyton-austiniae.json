    "intro": "Eburophyton austiniae, commonly known as Austin's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, typically appearing in late spring. The plant grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, instead having rhizomes that help anchor it to its substrate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
