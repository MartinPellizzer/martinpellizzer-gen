    "intro": "Eriogonum pedunculatum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Eriogonum pedunculatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a key species in its ecological community."
