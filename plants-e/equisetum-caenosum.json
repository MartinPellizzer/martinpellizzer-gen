    "intro": "Equisetum caenosum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of horsetail that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and vascular tissues. Equisetum caenosum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in humid conditions."
