    "intro": "Ephedra rituensis, commonly known as the desert tea, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra rituensis is known for its chemical composition, which includes ephedrine, a compound with medicinal properties. However, it is also considered a protected species in many regions due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
