It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
