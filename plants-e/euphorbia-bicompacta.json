    "intro": "Euphorbia bicompacta, commonly known as the compact euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with tightly clustered, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique flower structures, often surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
