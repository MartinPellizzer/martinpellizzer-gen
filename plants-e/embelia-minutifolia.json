    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved embelia, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties."
