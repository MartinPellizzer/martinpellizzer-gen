    "intro": "Echinopsis candicans var. gladiata, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often have a bluish or grayish hue. The plant produces striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
