    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus subsp. ctenoides, commonly known as the cactus hedgehog, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This subspecies is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
