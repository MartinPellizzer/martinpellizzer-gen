    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum f. polystachyum, commonly known as the tall horse-tail fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
