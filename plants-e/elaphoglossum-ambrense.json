    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ambrense, commonly known as the Ambrosia fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the leaves. Elaphoglossum ambrense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
