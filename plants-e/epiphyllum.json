    "intro": "Epiphyllum, commonly known as the orchid cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often used as a climbing structure. These plants are native to the Americas and are typically epiphytic, growing on other plants without being parasitic. Epiphyllum species produce showy, nocturnal flowers that come in a variety of colors. They require bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
