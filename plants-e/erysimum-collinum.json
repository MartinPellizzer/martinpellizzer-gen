    "intro": "Erysimum collinum, commonly known as the coastal wallflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Erysimum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
