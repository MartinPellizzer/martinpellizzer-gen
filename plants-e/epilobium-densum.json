    "intro": "Epilobium densum, commonly known as sticky willow or woolly willow, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Epilobium densum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
