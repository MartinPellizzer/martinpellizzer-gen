    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium proles dissectum, commonly known as the dissected bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this annual herb thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
