    "intro": "Echinocactus simpsonii var. minor, commonly known as the Simpson's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter, with prominent, cylindrical spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
