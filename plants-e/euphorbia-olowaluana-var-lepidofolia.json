    "intro": "Euphorbia olowaluana var. lepidofolia, commonly known as the Olowalu euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Hawaii. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
