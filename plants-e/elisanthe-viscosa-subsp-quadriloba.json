    "intro": "Elisanthe viscosa subsp. quadriloba, commonly known as the sticky elisanthe, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
