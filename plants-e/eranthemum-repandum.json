    "intro": "Eranthemum repandum, commonly known as the creeping eranthemum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Eranthemum repandum thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
