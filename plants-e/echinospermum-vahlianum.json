    "intro": "Echinospermum vahlianum, commonly known as the Vahlian's echinothecium, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a dry, spiny capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
