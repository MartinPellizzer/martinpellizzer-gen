    "intro": "Epidendrum pomacochense, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highlands of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems and its role in local biodiversity."
