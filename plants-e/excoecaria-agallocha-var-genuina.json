    "intro": "Excoecaria agallocha var. genuina, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or sea mango, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in coastal regions and estuaries. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of mangrove ecosystems."
