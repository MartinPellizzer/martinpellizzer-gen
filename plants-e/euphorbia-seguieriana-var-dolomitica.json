    "intro": "Euphorbia seguieriana var. dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomite euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
