    "intro": "Erica rubiginosa var. caespitosa, commonly known as the purple heath, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth patterns."
