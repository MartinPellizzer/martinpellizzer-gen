It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Eriodendron pubiflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream sides."
