    "intro": "Elaeagnus longiloba, commonly known as the long-stalked silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, edible berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has a robust root system and is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It produces fragrant flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Elaeagnus longiloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
