    "intro": "Eucalyptus pachycalyx subsp. pachycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
