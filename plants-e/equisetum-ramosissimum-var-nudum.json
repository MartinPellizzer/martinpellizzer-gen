    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile branches, with the latter producing spore-bearing cones. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called megaphylls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
