    "intro": "Echinopsis tephracantha, commonly known as the \"Tephracantha cactus,\" is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and a distinct crown of flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Echinopsis tephracantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
