    "intro": "Eriogonum lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and gravelly slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Eriogonum lewisii is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping."
