    "intro": "Euphorbia officinarum subsp. officinarum, commonly known as the common spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a feature common among many species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
