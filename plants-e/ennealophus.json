It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that resemble small cups, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, across North America. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. Ennealophus species are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
