    "intro": "Erythraea maritima var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sea erythraea, is a low-growing, salt-tolerant plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, adding a splash of color to the shoreline. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
