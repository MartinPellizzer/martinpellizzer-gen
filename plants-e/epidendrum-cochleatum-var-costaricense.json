It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive, almost spiral-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. It is valued in horticulture for its unique morphology and ornamental appeal."
