It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as eucalypts. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its white, tubular flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
