    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. montana, commonly known as the mountain eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
