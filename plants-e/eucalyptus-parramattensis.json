    "intro": "Eucalyptus parramattensis, commonly known as the Parramatta eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to the Sydney Basin in New South Wales. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters with a straight trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The bark is smooth and greyish-white, peeling in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically cream to pale yellow in color. The plant is well adapted to the moist, fertile soils of its native habitat and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
