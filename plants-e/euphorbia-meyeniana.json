    "intro": "Euphorbia meyeniana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to Central America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Euphorbia meyeniana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
