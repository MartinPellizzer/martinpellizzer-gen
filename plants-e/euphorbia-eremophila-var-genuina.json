    "intro": "Euphorbia eremophila var. genuina, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped leaves and a branched stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
