    "intro": "Erigeron andicola var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It produces blue to purple ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, typical of the genus Erigeron. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
