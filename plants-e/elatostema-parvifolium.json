    "intro": "Elatostema parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, which are characteristic of the Urticaceae family. Elatostema parvifolium is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade."
