    "intro": "Ervatamia oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ervatamia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Ervatamia oligantha is often found in fynbos vegetation, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
