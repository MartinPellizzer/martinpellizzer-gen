    "intro": "Eulophia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's eulophia, is a striking orchid native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
