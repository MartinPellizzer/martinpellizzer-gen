    "intro": "Equisetum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and needle-like leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wetlands. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record indicates a long evolutionary history. The plant contains high levels of silica, contributing to its rigid structure and giving it a distinctive appearance."
