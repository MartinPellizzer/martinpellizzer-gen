    "intro": "Elionurus tripsacoides, commonly known as the Andean panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience in harsh environments. Elionurus tripsacoides plays a role in local ecosystems by providing forage for livestock and habitat for various insects and small animals."
