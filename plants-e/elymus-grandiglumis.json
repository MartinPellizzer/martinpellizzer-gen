    "intro": "Elymus grandiglumis, commonly known as the big spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, open habitats. Elymus grandiglumis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological stability through its extensive root system."
