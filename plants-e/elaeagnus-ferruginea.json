    "intro": "Elaeagnus ferruginea, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Elaeagnus ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
