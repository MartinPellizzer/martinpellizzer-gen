    "intro": "Eucalyptus cinerea subsp. triplex, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its pale grey to silver bark, which peels in thin, papery flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a grey-green hue with a rough upper surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry, open woodlands and heathlands."
