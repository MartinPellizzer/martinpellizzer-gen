    "intro": "Erlangea huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea huillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
