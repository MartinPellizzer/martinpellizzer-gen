    "intro": "Euphorbia thelephora var. rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its floral structures. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat."
