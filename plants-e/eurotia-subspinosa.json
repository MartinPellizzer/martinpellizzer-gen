    "intro": "Eurotia subspinosa, commonly known as the spiny euonymus, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, orange-yellow fruits that contain seeds. Eurotia subspinosa is adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
