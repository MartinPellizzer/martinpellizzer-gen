    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. latiglumis, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
