It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with long, slender lemma and palea, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
