    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. hirta, commonly known as the Mitchell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a branching stem covered in short, stiff hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing stems and reduced leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
