    "intro": "Euonymus kanyakumariensis, commonly known as the Kanyakumari euonymus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern tip of India. It belongs to the family Cercidiphyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
