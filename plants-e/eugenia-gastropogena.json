It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rough, flaky bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are clustered in small groups and are typically pink or red in color, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
