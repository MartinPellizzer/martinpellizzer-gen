    "intro": "Euonymus frigidus var. elongatus, commonly known as the longleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
