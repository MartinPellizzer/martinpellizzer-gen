    "intro": "Ebenus depressa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme weather conditions. Ebenus depressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
