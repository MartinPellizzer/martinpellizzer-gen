    "intro": "Epacris impressa var. variifolia, commonly known as the Variable Epacris, is a species of flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This plant is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
