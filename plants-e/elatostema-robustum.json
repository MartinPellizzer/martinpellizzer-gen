    "intro": "Elatostema robustum, commonly known as the velvetleaf stellaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Elatostema robustum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
