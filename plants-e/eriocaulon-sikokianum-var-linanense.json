    "intro": "Eriocaulon sikokianum var. linanense, commonly known as the Linan marsh grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wetland and marsh environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water retention. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
