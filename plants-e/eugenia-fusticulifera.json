    "intro": "Eugenia fusticulifera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The tree is notable for its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
