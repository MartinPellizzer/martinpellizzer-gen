    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum subsp. opacum, commonly known as the tussock cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils such as tundra and wetlands. Its flowering occurs in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic organisms."
