    "intro": "Euphorbia tetracantha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Euphorbia tetracantha is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
