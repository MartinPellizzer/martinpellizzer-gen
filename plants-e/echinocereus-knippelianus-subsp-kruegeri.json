    "intro": "Echinocereus knippelianus subsp. kruegeri, commonly known as Krueger's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a woolly covering of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
