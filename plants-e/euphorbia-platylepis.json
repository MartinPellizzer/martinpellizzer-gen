    "intro": "Euphorbia platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
