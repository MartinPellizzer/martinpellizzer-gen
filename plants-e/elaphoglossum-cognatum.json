It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum cognatum is often found in association with other ferns and mosses in humid, temperate climates."
