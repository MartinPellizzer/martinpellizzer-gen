    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. hortensis, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its year-round visual interest. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
