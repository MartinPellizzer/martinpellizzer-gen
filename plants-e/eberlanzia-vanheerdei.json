    "intro": "Eberlanzia vanheerdei, commonly known as the Vanheer's eberlanzia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical research."
