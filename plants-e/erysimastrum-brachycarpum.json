    "intro": "Erysimastrum brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-carpel erysimastrum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The fruit is a short, dry capsule that contains several seeds, facilitating its dispersal in arid environments."
