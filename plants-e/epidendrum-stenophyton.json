    "intro": "Epidendrum stenophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum stenophyton is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain healthy growth."
