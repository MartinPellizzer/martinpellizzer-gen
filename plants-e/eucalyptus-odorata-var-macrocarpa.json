It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin sheets. The leaves are long, narrow, and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
