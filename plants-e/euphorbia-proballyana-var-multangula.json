    "intro": "Euphorbia proballyana var. multangula, commonly known as the multangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and adorned with small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
