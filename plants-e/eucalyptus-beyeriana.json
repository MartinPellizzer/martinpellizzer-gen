    "intro": "Eucalyptus beyeriana, commonly known as the Beyer's mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or pinkish hue when young. Eucalyptus beyeriana is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments."
