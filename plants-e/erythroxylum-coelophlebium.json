It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves contain alkaloids, although it is not as well-known for its psychoactive properties as other species in the genus. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats at moderate elevations."
