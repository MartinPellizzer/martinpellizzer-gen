    "intro": "Entada schlechteri, commonly known as the African horned bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers followed by distinctive, horn-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Its growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it is important to note that the seeds contain toxic compounds and should not be ingested."
