    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. limosum, commonly known as the swamp scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in wetland environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its historical use as a natural scouring agent is due to the abrasive nature of its silica-rich stems."
