    "intro": "Enhalus marinus, commonly known as the seagrass turtle grass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense underwater meadows, typically in shallow coastal waters. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It reproduces through flowering and seed dispersal, with its seeds often carried by water currents. Enhalus marinus is an important component of seagrass ecosystems, contributing to coastal biodiversity and carbon sequestration."
