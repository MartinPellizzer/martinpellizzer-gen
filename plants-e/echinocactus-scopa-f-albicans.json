It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
