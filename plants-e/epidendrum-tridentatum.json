    "intro": "Epidendrum tridentatum, commonly known as the Three-toothed Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with three prominent lobes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
