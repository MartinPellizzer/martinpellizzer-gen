    "intro": "Eucalyptus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting a variety of pollinators. Eucalyptus clivicola is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and cliff faces. Its aromatic oils make it a valuable plant for both ecological and commercial purposes."
