    "intro": "Euphorbia semivillosa, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its milky sap, it is considered somewhat toxic and should be handled with care."
