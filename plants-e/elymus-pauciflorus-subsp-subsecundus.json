    "intro": "Elymus pauciflorus subsp. subsecundus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
