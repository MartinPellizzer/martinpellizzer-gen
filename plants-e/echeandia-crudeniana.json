    "intro": "Echeandia crudeniana, commonly known as the Cruden's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a spineless, cylindrical plant that typically grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments with minimal water. Echeandia crudeniana is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
