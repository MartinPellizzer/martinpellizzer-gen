    "intro": "Epischoenus, commonly known as the common water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Epischoenus species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers of Epischoenus play an important role in pollination by attracting insects during the day."
