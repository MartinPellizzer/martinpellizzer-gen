    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides subsp. arbuscula, commonly known as the \"buttercup spurge,\" is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its distinctive floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
