    "intro": "Eriocaulon decumbens, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a dense, prostrate growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves that often form a mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Eriocaulon decumbens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
