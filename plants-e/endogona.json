    "intro": "Endogona, commonly known as the \"false lichen,\" is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Endogona species are characterized by their crustose or foliose growth forms, often forming dense, colorful mats on rock surfaces. They are commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The chemical composition of Endogona includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to their ecological roles and potential medicinal uses."
