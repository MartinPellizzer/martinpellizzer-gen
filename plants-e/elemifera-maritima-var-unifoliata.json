    "intro": "Elemifera maritima var. unifoliata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically arranged in a compact inflorescence, adding visual interest to coastal landscapes. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
