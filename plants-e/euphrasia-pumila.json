    "intro": "Euphrasia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, hairy stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy eyespots, which are characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Euphrasia pumila is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
