It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
