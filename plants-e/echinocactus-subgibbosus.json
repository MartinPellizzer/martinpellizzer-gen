    "intro": "Echinocactus subgibbosus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its spines are short and often white or pale yellow, providing protection from herbivores. Echinocactus subgibbosus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
