    "intro": "Effusiella convallaria, commonly known as the spreading lily-of-the-valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Effusiella convallaria is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
