    "intro": "Eucalyptus incrassata var. costata, commonly known as the rough-barked apple gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough texture. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to withstand drought and fire."
