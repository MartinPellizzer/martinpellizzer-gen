    "intro": "Epidendrum enantilobum, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a reddish or purplish hue along the edges. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum enantilobum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners."
