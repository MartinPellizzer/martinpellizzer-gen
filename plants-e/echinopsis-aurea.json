    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, globular shape, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Echinopsis aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
