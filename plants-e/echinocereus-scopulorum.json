    "intro": "Echinocereus scopulorum, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and bats. The cactus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions."
