    "intro": "Eriophyllum chrysanthum, commonly known as golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of Oregon. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eriophyllum chrysanthum is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
