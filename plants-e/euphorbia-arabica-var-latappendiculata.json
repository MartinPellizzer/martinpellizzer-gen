    "intro": "Euphorbia arabica var. latappendiculata, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and stores water in its leaves and stems. This variation is notable for its distinct appendages on the flower clusters, setting it apart from other Euphorbia species."
