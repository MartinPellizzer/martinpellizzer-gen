    "intro": "Eriocaulon robustum var. caulescens, commonly known as the robust marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a caulescent growth habit, meaning it has an upright stem rather than being prostrate, which distinguishes it from other varieties in the genus. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers, typical of the Eriocaulaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. This variety is adapted to saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
