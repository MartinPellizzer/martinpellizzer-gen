    "intro": "Echinops polygamus, commonly known as the Persian crown flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, spiny fruit. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils. Echinops polygamus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
