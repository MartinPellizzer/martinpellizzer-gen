    "intro": "Euphorbia sacchii, commonly known as the Sacchi's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Euphorbia sacchii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
