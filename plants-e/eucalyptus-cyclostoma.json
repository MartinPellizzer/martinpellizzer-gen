    "intro": "Eucalyptus cyclostoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, often greyish bark. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically open to reveal white or pinkish flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Eucalyptus cyclostoma is often found in sandy soils and is part of the diverse flora of the Australian mallee regions."
