    "intro": "Eragrostis whitneyi var. caumii, commonly known as Whitney's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control."
