It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has bloomed. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Its leaves are grass-like and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Eriophorum textile is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
