It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
