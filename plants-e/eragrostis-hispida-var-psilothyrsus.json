    "intro": "Eragrostis hispida var. psilothyrsus, commonly known as narrowawn fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear short, bristle-tipped florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
