    "intro": "Eunanus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's eunanus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
