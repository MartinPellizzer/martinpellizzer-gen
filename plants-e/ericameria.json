    "intro": "Ericameria, commonly known as green coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Ericameria species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their narrow, often aromatic leaves and yellow or orange composite flowers. They are adapted to dry environments and are often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Many species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
