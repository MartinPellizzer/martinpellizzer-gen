    "intro": "Eucalyptus coriacea, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and aromatic leaves that release a strong eucalyptus scent when crushed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus coriacea is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental features."
