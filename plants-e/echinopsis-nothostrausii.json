    "intro": "Echinopsis nothostrausii, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly in Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive radial ribs that bear spines and are often adorned with small, white flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage. It produces showy, night-blooming flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
