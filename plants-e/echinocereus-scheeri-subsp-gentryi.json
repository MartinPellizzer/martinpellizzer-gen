    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri subsp. gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems covered in dense clusters of bright green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments."
