    "intro": "Euphorbia pudibunda var. pudibunda, commonly known as the shy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a unique appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
