    "intro": "Euphorbia collina var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and branched stems that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are typically narrow, fleshy, and display a striking yellow-green coloration, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
