    "intro": "Eriocaulon annuum, commonly known as the annual spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Eriocaulon annuum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
