    "intro": "Ephedra minuta, commonly known as the dwarf ephedra, is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Ephedra minuta is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its stems. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
