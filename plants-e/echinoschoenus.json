    "intro": "Echinoschoenus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal and wetland environments, where they thrive in saline or brackish conditions. Echinoschoenus species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. They produce small, often white or pale flowers that are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize shorelines."
