    "intro": "Epidendrum hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are usually pink or white with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. Epidendrum hoffmannii is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
