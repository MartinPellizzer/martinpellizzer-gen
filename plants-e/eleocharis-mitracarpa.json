    "intro": "Eleocharis mitracarpa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Eleocharis mitracarpa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
