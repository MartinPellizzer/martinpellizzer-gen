It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its small, scale-like leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance.
