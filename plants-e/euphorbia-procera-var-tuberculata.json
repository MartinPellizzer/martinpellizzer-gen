It features a woody stem with a distinctive, branched structure and produces yellowish-green, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves. The sap of this plant is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
