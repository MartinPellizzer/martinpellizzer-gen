    "intro": "Elymus vulpinus, commonly known as goat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Elymus vulpinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
