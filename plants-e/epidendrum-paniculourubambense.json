It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, red-brown flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical study."
