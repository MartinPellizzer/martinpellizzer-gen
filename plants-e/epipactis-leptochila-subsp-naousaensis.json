    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. naousaensis, commonly known as the Naousa orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
