It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its common name. It produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Ericoides pubescens is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
