    "intro": "Eucalyptus kondininensis, commonly known as the Kondinin gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, revealing a silver-grey underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green coloration. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range."
