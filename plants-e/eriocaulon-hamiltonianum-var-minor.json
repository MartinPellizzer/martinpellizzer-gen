    "intro": "Eriocaulon hamiltonianum var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous inflorescences that produce minute flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with specialized root systems for oxygen uptake in waterlogged conditions."
