    "intro": "Epidendrum spathatum, commonly known as the Spathe Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture. Epidendrum spathatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
