    "intro": "Epipactis henryi, commonly known as Henry's helleborine, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from green to brown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Epipactis henryi is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them."
