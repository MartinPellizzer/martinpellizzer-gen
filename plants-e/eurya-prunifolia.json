    "intro": "Eurya prunifolia, commonly known as the cherryleaf eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble cherry leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Eurya prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
