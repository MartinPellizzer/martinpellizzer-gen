    "intro": "Eriosyce sandillon var. vallenarensis, commonly known as the Vallenar cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. It thrives in extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
