It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid-region vegetation."
