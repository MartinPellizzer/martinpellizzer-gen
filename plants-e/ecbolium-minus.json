    "intro": "Ecbolium minus, commonly known as the lesser ecbolium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds within pods. Ecbolium minus is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
