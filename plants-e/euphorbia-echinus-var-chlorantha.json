    "intro": "Euphorbia echinus var. chlorantha, commonly known as the green spurge or chloranthus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick, spiny stem that often branches into a bushy form. The leaves are alternate, fleshy, and typically green, though some varieties may have a bluish or purplish hue. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by a crown of modified leaves called cyathia. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
