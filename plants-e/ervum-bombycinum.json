It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to temperate regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
