    "intro": "Echinocactus pygmaeus, commonly known as the pebble cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by spiny, red fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped landscapes."
