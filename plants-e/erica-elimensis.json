    "intro": "Erica elimensis, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in winter, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark green foliage. Erica elimensis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is popular in horticulture, particularly in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates."
