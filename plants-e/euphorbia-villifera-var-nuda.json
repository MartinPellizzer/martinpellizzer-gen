It is characterized by its stem-like structure and reduced leaves, which are often absent or highly modified. The plant produces a distinctive yellowish-green sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
