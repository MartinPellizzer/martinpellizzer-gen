    "intro": "Echinaria capitata var. todaroana, commonly known as the Todaroan hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense clusters of small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
