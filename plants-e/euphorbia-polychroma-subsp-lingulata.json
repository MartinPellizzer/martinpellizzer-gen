It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, ribbed stems that display a striking red or purple coloration, especially under stress or in bright light. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
