It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring season. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
