    "intro": "Eucalyptus fergusonii subsp. dorsiventralis, commonly known as the northern rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its essential oils contain compounds like eucalyptol, making it valuable for medicinal and aromatic uses."
