It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and distinctive, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its foliage turns vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, suitable for garden borders or as a hedge."
