    "intro": "Eriogonum trachygonum subsp. membranaceum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh desert conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
