It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated bracts that surround the flower heads, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Elleanthus longibracteatus is typically drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
