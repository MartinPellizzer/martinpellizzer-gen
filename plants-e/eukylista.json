    "intro": "Eukylista, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that often have a silvery or white underside, giving it its common name. The plant is native to various regions in Africa, particularly in the savannas and woodlands. Eukylista species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family."
