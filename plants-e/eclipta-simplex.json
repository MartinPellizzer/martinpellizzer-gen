    "intro": "Eclipta simplex, commonly known as false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth. Eclipta simplex has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
