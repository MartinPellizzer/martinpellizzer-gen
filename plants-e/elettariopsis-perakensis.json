It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit and a preference for nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
