It features rhizomatous growth and produces striking violet-tinged, miter-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit. Epimedium violaceum is also noted for its adaptability to woodland gardens and its ability to naturalize over time."
