    "intro": "Euclea tomentosa, commonly known as the white stinkwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, oval fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of tannins."
