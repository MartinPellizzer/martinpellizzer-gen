    "intro": "Evolvulus saxatilis, commonly known as rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems adapted to withstand dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Evolvulus saxatilis is often found growing in rocky soils and crevices, thriving in full sun."
