    "intro": "Eugenia dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's clove, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
