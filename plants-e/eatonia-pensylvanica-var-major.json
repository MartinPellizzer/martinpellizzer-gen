    "intro": "Eatonia pensylvanica var. major, commonly known as the Pennsylvania giant bellflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant grows up to 6 feet tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in supporting local pollinator populations."
