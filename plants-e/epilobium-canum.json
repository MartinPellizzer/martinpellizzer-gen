    "intro": "Epilobium canum, commonly known as sticky willow or redstem willow, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often reddish in color. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in the summer months. Epilobium canum is sometimes used in traditional medicine and can be an indicator species for wetland environments."
