    "intro": "Erica tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Erica tenuissima is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
