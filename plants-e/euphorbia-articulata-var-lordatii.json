    "intro": "Euphorbia articulata var. lordatii, commonly known as the Lord's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped and arranged oppositely along the stems. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats."
