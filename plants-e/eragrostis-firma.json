    "intro": "Eragrostis firma, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
