    "intro": "Epigaea, commonly known as trailing arbutus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Epigaea thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, particularly in the understory where it receives partial shade."
