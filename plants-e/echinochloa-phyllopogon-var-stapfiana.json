It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can be invasive in certain environments, impacting local ecosystems."
