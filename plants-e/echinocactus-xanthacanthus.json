    "intro": "Echinocactus xanthacanthus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its thick, waxy skin helps it store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
