    "intro": "Eragrostis bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control in tropical environments."
