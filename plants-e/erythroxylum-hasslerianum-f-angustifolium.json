    "intro": "Erythroxylum hasslerianum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and reddish stems, which are typical features of the Erythroxylum genus. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which have historically been used for traditional and medicinal purposes. This subspecies is of particular interest due to its botanical similarities to other coca species and its ecological significance in the Andean ecosystem."
