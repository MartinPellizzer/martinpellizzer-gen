It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces numerous small, white to pale blue ray florets. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
