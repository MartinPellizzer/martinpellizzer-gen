    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brevissimum, commonly known as the short-stalked holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact fronds with finely divided, serrated leaflets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
