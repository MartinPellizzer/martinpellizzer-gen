    "intro": "Eragrostis pogonia, commonly known as the purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments. Eragrostis pogonia is often found in wetland ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
