    "intro": "Euphorbia patula subsp. anacantha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and can vary in shape, sometimes being lobed or spine-tipped. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
