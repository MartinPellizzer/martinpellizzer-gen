    "intro": "Epithecia mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii crust, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or brown coloration, depending on the moisture content and environmental conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as rocky outcrops and mountainous areas. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
