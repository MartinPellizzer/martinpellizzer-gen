    "intro": "Erysimum fitzii, commonly known as the Fitz's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erysimum fitzii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
