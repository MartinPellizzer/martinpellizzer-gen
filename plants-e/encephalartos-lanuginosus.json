    "intro": "Encephalartos lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, evergreen species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
