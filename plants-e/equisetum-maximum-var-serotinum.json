    "intro": "Equisetum maximum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spores in late summer, which is why it is referred to as \"serotinum,\" meaning \"late-bearing.\" It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
