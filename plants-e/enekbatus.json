    "intro": "Enekbatus, commonly known as the golden bower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and a rapid growth rate, making it popular for ornamental purposes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Enekbatus is often used in landscaping to create dense, lush coverage along trellises or fences."
