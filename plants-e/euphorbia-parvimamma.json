    "intro": "Euphorbia parvimamma, commonly known as the baby's breath euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
