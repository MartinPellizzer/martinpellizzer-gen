It is characterized by its delicate, pale-colored flowers that resemble translucent, ghostly shapes, giving it its unique common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Eggelingia is considered a rare and challenging plant for botanists to study."
