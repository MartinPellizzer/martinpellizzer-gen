    "intro": "Exarata chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The Choc\u00f3 orchid plays an important role in the biodiversity of its habitat and is a symbol of the rich flora of the Choc\u00f3 region."
