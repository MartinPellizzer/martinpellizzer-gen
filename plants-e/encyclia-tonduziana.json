    "intro": "Encyclia tonduziana, commonly known as the Tonduz orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and they bloom during the wet season. Encyclia tonduziana is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and near streams."
