    "intro": "Englerodendron usambarense, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
