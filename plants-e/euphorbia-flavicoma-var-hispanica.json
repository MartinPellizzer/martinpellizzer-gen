    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
