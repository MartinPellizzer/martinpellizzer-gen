    "intro": "Euphorbia levis, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, smooth-stemmed structure and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic and irritate the skin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Euphorbia levis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
