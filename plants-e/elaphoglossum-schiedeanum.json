    "intro": "Elaphoglossum schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiedea fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and shade. Elaphoglossum schiedeanum is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
