    "intro": "Elymus virginicus f. hirsutiglumis, commonly known as the hirsute glume wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy glumes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
