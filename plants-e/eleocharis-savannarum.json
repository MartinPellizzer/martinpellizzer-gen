It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. Eleocharis savannarum typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in wetland environments. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
