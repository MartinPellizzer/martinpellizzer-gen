    "intro": "Echinocactus johnsonii subsp. octocentrus, commonly known as the Johnson's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, erect pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in harsh, desert environments. This subspecies is highly valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and resilience."
