    "intro": "Epidendrum pictum, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flower spikes that can range from red to orange, with intricate patterns resembling painted designs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum pictum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
