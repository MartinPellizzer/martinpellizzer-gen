    "intro": "Eucosia longirostrata, commonly known as the long-snout eucosia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Eucosia longirostrata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
