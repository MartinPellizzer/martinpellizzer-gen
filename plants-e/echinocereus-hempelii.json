    "intro": "Echinocereus hempelii, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of spiny, globose flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Echinocereus hempelii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
