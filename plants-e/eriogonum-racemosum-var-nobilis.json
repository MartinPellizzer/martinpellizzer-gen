    "intro": "Eriogonum racemosum var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
