    "intro": "Eucalyptus santalifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. Eucalyptus santalifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardiness and unique foliage."
