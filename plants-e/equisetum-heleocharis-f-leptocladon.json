    "intro": "Equisetum heleocharis f. leptocladon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed water horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically green and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions."
