    "intro": "Eragrostis tenuifolia, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce light blue to purple flowers. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Eragrostis tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
