    "intro": "Erycina zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white blooms with intricate patterns, often resembling those of other orchid genera. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erycina zamorensis is considered a conservation concern."
