    "intro": "Eryngium floribundum, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and its showy, purple-blue flower heads that resemble small umbrellas. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by pale blue bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Eryngium floribundum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
