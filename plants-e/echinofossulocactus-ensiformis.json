    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus ensiformis, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and collections."
