It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive pointed tip. Echeveria cornuta thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant color."
