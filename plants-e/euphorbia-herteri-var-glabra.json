    "intro": "Euphorbia herteri var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its smooth, hairless stems distinguish it from other varieties within the Euphorbia genus."
