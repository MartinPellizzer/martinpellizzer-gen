    "intro": "Echinocactus mammillifer, commonly known as the mammillate cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered with prominent, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
