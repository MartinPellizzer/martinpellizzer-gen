    "intro": "Escobaria missouriensis var. asperispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the central United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its spiny stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
