    "intro": "Engelhardia polystachya, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in forest understories. Engelhardia polystachya is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
