    "intro": "Espeletia schultzii var. mucurubana, commonly known as the Mucuruban heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is part of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
