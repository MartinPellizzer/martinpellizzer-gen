It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
