It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple-pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eryngium serbicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
