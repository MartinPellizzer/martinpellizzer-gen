    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its foliage remains dense throughout the year, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover."
