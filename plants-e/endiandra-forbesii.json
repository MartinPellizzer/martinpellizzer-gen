    "intro": "Endiandra forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' endiandra, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forest regrowth. Its fruits are small capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
