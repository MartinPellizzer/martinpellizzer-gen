    "intro": "Euphorbia stracheyi var. radiata, commonly known as the radiate euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves arranged in a radial pattern. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
