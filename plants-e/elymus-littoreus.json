    "intro": "Elymus littoreus, commonly known as seaside barley or beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used for dune stabilization due to its hardy nature. Elymus littoreus plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
