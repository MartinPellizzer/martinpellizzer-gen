    "intro": "Epidendrum gratiosum, commonly known as the graceful epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum gratiosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
