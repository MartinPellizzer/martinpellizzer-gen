    "intro": "Euphorbia aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually fleshy and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Euphorbia aragonensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
