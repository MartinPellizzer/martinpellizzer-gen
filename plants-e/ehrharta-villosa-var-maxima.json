It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
