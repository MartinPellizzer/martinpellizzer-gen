    "intro": "Euphorbia adenopoda, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Euphorbia adenopoda is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
