    "intro": "Erigeron foliosus var. franciscensis, commonly known as Franciscan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
