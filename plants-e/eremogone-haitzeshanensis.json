    "intro": "Eremogone haitzeshanensis, commonly known as the Hainan eremogone, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with inconspicuous petals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
