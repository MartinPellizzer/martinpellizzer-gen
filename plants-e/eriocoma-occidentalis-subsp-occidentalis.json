    "intro": "Eriocoma occidentalis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western eriocoma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, mat-forming appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and slopes. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white or pale pink, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found at higher elevations."
