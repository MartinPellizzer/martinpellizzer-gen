    "intro": "Echeveria colorata, commonly known as the rainbow echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with red, pink, or purple hues. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces vibrant violet or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
