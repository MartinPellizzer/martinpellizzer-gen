    "intro": "Echinocereus pentalophus subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the Arizona night-blooming cactus, is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features spiny, ribbed stems that are often prostrate, with clusters of bright yellow flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are active during the night. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in desert conditions."
