    "intro": "Euphorbia gillettii, commonly known as the Gillett's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia gillettii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
