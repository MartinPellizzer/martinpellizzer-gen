    "intro": "Elymus compositus, commonly known as the composite wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus compositus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
