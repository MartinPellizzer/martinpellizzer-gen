    "intro": "Encephalartos pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of dark green, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces a short, cylindrical stem and small, cone-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
