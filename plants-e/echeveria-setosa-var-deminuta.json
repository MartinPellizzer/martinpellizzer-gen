It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually striking succulent."
