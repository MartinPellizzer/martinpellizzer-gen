    "intro": "Elatostema filicaule, commonly known as the fern-like elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elatostemaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a fern, though they are actually simple and not compound. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in the summer months. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Elatostema filicaule thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
