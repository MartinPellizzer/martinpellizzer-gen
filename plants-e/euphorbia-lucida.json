    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida, commonly known as the shining spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Euphorbia lucida is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
