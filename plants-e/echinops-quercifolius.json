    "intro": "Echinops quercifolius, commonly known as the oak-leaved thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed, giving it a resemblance to oak leaves, hence its scientific name. Echinops quercifolius is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant properties."
