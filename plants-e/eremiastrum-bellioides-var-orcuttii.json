    "intro": "Eremiastrum bellioides var. orcuttii, commonly known as Orcutt's needlegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in desert ecosystems. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Eremiastrum bellioides."
