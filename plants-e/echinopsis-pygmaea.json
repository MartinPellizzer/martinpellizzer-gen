    "intro": "Echinopsis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and dense covering of white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor cultivation."
