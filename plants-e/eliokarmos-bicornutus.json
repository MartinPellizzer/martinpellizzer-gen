    "intro": "Eliokarmos bicornutus, commonly known as the two-horned elokarmos, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bi-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, woody stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers are typically a vibrant mix of red and yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
