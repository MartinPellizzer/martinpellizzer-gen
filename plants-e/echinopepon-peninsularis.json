    "intro": "Echinopepon peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular horned melon, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and melons. The plant produces large, spiky, green fruits that resemble a horned melon, with a thick, fibrous rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its botanical features include palmate leaves and tendrils typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
