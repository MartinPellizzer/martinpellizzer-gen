    "intro": "Euphorbia palatinata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, spiny stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia palatinata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
