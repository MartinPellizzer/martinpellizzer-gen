It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant color. Due to its attractive appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
