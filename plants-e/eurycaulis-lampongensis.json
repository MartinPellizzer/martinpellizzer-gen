    "intro": "Eurycaulis lampongensis, commonly known as the Lampong wild orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
