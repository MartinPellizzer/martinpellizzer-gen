    "intro": "Euphorbia echinata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
