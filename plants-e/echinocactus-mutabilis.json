    "intro": "Echinocactus mutabilis, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny exterior that provides protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The plant's most distinctive feature is its bright yellow, globular form, which becomes more pronounced as it matures. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky exterior."
