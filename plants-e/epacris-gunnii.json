    "intro": "Epacris gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Epacris gunnii is often found in regions with a temperate climate, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful cultivation to thrive."
