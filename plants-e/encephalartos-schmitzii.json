    "intro": "Encephalartos schmitzii, commonly known as the Schmitz\u2019s cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
