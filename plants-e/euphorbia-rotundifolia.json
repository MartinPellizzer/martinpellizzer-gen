    "intro": "Euphorbia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are round or nearly circular in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and dry meadows. Due to its milky sap, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care."
