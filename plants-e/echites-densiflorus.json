    "intro": "Echites densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower echites, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Echites densiflorus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged drought periods."
