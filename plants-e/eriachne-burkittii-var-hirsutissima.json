It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soils in native ecosystems."
