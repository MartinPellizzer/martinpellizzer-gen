    "intro": "Euchresta tubulosa var. longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
