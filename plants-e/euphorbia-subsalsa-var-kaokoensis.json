    "intro": "Euphorbia subsalsa var. kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Namibia and Angola. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a spiny texture. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem to survive drought conditions. Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to xerophytic gardens."
