    "intro": "Epidendrum campbellstigma, commonly known as the Campbell's stigmatum orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Epidendrum campbellstigma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
