    "intro": "Erica semisulcata, commonly known as the coastal heath or dwarf heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal and sandy environments. Erica semisulcata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
