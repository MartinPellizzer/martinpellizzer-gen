    "intro": "Eria hologlossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and unique, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eria hologlossa is considered endangered in many regions."
