    "intro": "Elatostema lineolatum var. bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed false shamrock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with two distinct teeth on each leaflet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms."
