It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
