    "intro": "Eragrostis retinorrhoea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable component of native plant communities. Eragrostis retinorrhoea is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
