    "intro": "Evolvulus glabriusculus, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing annual vine characterized by its hairy stems and small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a weed and a decorative plant in some regions."
