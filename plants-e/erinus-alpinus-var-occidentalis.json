    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western alpine erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
