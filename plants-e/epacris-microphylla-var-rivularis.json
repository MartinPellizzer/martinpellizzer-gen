    "intro": "Epacris microphylla var. rivularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a member of the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, pinkish-white flowers. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock faces and forest floors. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators like bees and birds."
