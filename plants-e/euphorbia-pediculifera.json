    "intro": "Euphorbia pediculifera, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a short, thick stem and a cluster of modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
