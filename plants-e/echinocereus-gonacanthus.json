    "intro": "Echinocereus gonacanthus, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocereus gonacanthus is well adapted to desert conditions, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure."
