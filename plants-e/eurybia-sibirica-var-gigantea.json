    "intro": "Eurybia sibirica var. gigantea, commonly known as the Siberian Aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor, sandy soils and harsh winter conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
