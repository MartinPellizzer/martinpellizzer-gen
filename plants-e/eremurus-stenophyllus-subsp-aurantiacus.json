    "intro": "Eremurus stenophyllus subsp. aurantiacus, commonly known as the red-flowered spearthistle, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, well-drained soils."
