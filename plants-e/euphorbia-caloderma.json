    "intro": "Euphorbia caloderma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, so handling the plant requires caution. Euphorbia caloderma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
