    "intro": "Echinopsis klingleriana, commonly known as the Klein's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Echinopsis klingleriana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
