    "intro": "Epipactis alpina, commonly known as the alpine helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Epipactis alpina is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Its morphology and ecological niche reflect its adaptation to harsh mountain environments."
