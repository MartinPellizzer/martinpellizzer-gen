    "intro": "Epimedium parvifolium, commonly known as barrenwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features heart-shaped, finely toothed leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and early blooming habit."
