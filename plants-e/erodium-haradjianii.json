    "intro": "Erodium haradjianii, commonly known as the Haradjian's sticky weed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and have a sticky texture, contributing to its common name. Erodium haradjianii is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
