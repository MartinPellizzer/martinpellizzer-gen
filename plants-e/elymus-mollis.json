    "intro": "Elymus mollis, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky-textured foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. Its flowering stems are usually slender and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Elymus mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
