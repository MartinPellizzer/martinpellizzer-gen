    "intro": "Erythraea turolensis, commonly known as the Turol's erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Erythraeeaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to withstand cold temperatures and intense sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
