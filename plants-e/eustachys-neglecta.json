    "intro": "Eustachys neglecta, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
