    "intro": "Euphorbia telephioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbia telephioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
