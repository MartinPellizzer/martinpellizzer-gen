    "intro": "Eulophia nuttii, commonly known as the Nuttall's eulophia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces racemes of white to pale yellow blooms, which are often adorned with dark markings. Eulophia nuttii thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and wetlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
