    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua subsp. exigua, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed or small milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, sometimes spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, water-storing tissues help it survive in drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
