It is a herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
