    "intro": "Eleusine stolonifera, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u725b\u7b4b\u8349, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid spread, it can become invasive in certain environments."
