    "intro": "Eucalyptus socialis subsp. eucentrica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It produces woody, cylindrical capsules that contain numerous small, brown seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
