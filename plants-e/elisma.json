    "intro": "Elisma, commonly known as the goldenstar, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Elisma hyemalis, which is native to the eastern United States. These plants are herbaceous perennials that typically grow in moist, woodland habitats. Their leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish hue, while their flowers are small and clustered in dense, golden-yellow inflorescences. Elisma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and adding visual interest to shaded gardens."
