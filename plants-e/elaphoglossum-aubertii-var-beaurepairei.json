    "intro": "Elaphoglossum aubertii var. beaurepairei, commonly known as the Beaurepaire's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
