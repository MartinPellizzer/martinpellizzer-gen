    "intro": "Epidendrum diguetii, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow floral bracts, which are often more showy than the actual flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting its evergreen foliage. Epidendrum diguetii is valued in horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and adaptability to cultivation."
