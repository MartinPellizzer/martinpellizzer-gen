    "intro": "Erica ramulosa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Erica ramulosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
