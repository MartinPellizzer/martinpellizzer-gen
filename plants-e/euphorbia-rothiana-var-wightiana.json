    "intro": "Euphorbia rothiana var. wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
