It is a short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often densely packed with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.
