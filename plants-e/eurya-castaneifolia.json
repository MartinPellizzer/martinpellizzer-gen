    "intro": "Eurya castaneifolia, commonly known as the Chinese holly or red holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
