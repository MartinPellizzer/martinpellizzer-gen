    "intro": "Eucalyptus salmonophloia, commonly known as the salmon gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive salmon-pink to orange-brown bark, which peels in strips to reveal a lighter inner layer. The tree typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough, hairy texture."
