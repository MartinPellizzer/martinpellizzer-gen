    "intro": "Elaeocarpus dolichostylus, commonly known as the long-styled elaeocarp, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
