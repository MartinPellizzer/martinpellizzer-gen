    "intro": "Erythrina crista-galli var. leucochlora, commonly known as the white plume coral tree, is a variant of the coral tree species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, feathery, white-pink inflorescences that resemble plumes, distinguishing it from the typical red flowers of the standard variety. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are borne in long, branching clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The white plume coral tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
