It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, edible berries that ripen in the autumn. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping. It produces fragrant flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wood of Elaeagnus turcomanica is dense and strong, historically used for construction and tool-making in its native regions."
