    "intro": "Erica tubercularis, commonly known as the tubercular heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to the coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly in regions with sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica tubercularis typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
