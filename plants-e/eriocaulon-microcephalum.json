    "intro": "Eriocaulon microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that bear small, clustered spikes of flowers, which are often surrounded by dense, hairy bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon microcephalum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
