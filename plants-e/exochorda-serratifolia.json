    "intro": "Exochorda serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by clusters of dark purple berries in the fall. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its ornate appearance. The berries are edible but are typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
