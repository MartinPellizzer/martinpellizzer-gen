    "intro": "Erica intervallaris var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
