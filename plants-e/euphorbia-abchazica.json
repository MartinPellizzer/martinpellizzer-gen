    "intro": "Euphorbia abchazica, commonly known as the Abchazian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia abchazica is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
