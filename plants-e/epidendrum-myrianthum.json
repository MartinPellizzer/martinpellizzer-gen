    "intro": "Epidendrum myrianthum, commonly known as the \"Crimson Sword\" or \"Red Epidendrum,\" is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting green veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum myrianthum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
