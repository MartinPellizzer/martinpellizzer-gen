    "intro": "Elwendia capusii, commonly known as the red-twigged dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red stems that stand out against the green foliage, especially in winter. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. Elwendia capusii thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
