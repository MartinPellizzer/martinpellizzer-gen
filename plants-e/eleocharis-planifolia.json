    "intro": "Eleocharis planifolia, commonly known as flatleaf bulbous sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in various aquatic habitats. Eleocharis planifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
