    "intro": "Epidendrum cocornocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink, which emit a subtle scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
