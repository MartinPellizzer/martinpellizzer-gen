    "intro": "Echinops atrox, commonly known as the blackthorn globe-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in small, bristly spines. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echinops atrox is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
