    "intro": "Eriocoma membranacea, commonly known as the membranous eriocoma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
