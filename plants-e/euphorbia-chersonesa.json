    "intro": "Euphorbia chersonesa, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among many species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Euphorbia chersonesa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
