It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that becomes more cylindrical with age. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its spines are modified stems and serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Echinocactus solenacanthus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
