    "intro": "Euphorbia phagriformis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia phagriformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
