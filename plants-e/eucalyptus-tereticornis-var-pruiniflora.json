    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. pruiniflora, commonly known as the pink bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to pinkish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-grey coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to cream, arranged in clusters, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands."
