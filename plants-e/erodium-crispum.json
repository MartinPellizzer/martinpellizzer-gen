    "intro": "Erodium crispum, commonly known as coastal bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, curved, and resemble a bird's beak, giving it its common name. Erodium crispum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
