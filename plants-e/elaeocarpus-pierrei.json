    "intro": "Elaeocarpus pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Leone ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by dark purple, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
