It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Boneset is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects."
