    "intro": "Epidendrum polybulbon, commonly known as the clustered flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum polybulbon is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
