    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia subsp. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
