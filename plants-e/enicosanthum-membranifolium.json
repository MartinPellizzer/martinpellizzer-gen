    "intro": "Enicosanthum membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green stems and thin, membranous leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
