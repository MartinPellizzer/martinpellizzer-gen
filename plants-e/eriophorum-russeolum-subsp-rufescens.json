    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum subsp. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of silky, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in tufts at the base of the plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a key component of tundra and mountain vegetation."
