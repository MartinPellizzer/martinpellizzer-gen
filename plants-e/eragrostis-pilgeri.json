    "intro": "Eragrostis pilgeri, commonly known as Pilger's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Eragrostis pilgeri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
