    "intro": "Euphorbia hereroensis, commonly known as the Herero spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Namibia and Angola. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and latex contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia hereroensis is often found in rocky habitats and is well-suited to withstand drought conditions."
