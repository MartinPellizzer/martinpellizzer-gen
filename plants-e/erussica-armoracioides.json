It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential in agricultural settings."
