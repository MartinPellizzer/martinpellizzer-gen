    "intro": "Echinochloa macrocorvi, commonly known as large-seeded barnyard grass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with bracts that are longer than the flowers. Its seeds are small, with a distinctive three-angled shape, and are dispersed by wind. E. macrocorvi is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
