    "intro": "Epidendrum alabastrialatum, commonly known as the Alabaster Lip, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that support its leaves and flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip that resembles alabaster in texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
