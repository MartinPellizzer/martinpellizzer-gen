    "intro": "Elatostema tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, commonly known as the nettle family, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. Elatostema tomentosum is often found in forest understories and is adapted to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
