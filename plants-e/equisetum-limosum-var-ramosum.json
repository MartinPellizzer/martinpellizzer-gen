    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. ramosum, commonly known as the tufted scouring rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its more branched and dense growth habit compared to other varieties of Equisetum limosum."
