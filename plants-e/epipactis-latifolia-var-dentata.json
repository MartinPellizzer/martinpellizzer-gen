    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. dentata, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are lip-shaped and have a distinctive pattern of veins, which aid in pollination by insects. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more pronounced toothed leaf margins."
