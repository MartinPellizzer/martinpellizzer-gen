    "intro": "Echinops vaginatus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which give it its common name. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Echinops vaginatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
