    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. crispum, commonly known as the curlyleaf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, hairy leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
