It is a leguminous species that belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or white, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds.
