    "intro": "Ephedra intermedia var. persica, commonly known as Persian ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains ephedrine, a stimulant alkaloid, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many countries."
