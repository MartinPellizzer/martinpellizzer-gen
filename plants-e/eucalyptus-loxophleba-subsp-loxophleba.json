    "intro": "Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. loxophleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often narrow and slightly hairy. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
