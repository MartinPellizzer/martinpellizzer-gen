It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 15 centimeters. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
