It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is a fleshy, edible pulp that ripens to a red or yellow color. The species is characterized by its spiny areoles and is well adapted to desert conditions."
