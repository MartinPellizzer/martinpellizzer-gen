    "intro": "Erica ceraria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and summer. Erica ceraria is evergreen, with dense, needle-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
