    "intro": "Eupatorium gracilipes, commonly known as slender boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind pollination. Eupatorium gracilipes is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
