    "intro": "Eleusine cruciata, commonly known as finger millet, is a warm-season annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces edible grains that are rich in calcium and are a staple food in many parts of Africa and South Asia. Its leaves are also used in traditional cuisines. Eleusine cruciata is adapted to grow in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it an important crop in arid regions."
