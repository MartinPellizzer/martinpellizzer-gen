    "intro": "Eupatorium glandulosum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems covered in sticky, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. White boneset is often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
