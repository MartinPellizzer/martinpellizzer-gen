    "intro": "Epidendrum pareciense, commonly known as the Parceiense Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with brightly colored, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Epidendrum pareciense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
