    "intro": "Erysimum asperum var. arkansanum, commonly known as the Arkansas wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which are typically borne on elongated stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant collections."
