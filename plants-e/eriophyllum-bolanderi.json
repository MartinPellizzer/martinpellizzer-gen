    "intro": "Eriophyllum bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow floral heads surrounded by a fuzzy, woolly layer of bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal scrub and dune habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriophyllum bolanderi is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils."
