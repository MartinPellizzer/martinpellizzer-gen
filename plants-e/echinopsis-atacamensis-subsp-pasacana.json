    "intro": "Echinopsis atacamensis subsp. pasacana, commonly known as the Atacama torch cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to the extreme desert conditions of its habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
