    "intro": "Eriachne rigida, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eriachne rigida is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
