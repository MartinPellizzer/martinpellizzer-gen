    "intro": "Euphorbia zahnii, commonly known as the Zahn's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia zahnii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
