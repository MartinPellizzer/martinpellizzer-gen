    "intro": "Enckea schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and emits a fragrant aroma. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
