    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, downward-facing appearance. Its foliage and flowers are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, moist soils."
