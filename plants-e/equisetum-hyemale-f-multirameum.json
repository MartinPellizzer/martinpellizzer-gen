    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. multirameum, commonly known as the southern horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments, reflecting its preference for humid conditions."
