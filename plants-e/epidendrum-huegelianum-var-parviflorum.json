It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is well-suited for hanging baskets or small pots."
