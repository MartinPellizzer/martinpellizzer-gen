    "intro": "Eriococcus, commonly known as the woolly aphid, is a genus of scale insects belonging to the family Eriococcidae. These tiny, soft-bodied insects are characterized by their dense, waxy, and often fluffy coating, which gives them their common name. They are typically found on the stems, leaves, and fruits of a wide range of host plants, including ornamentals and fruit trees. Eriococcus species feed on plant sap using their piercing-siphoning mouthparts, which can cause deformation or stunted growth in their host plants. Their presence is often indicated by the honeydew they secrete, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold."
