    "intro": "Euphorbia cotinoides, commonly known as the Mexican Firecracker, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a dense, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
