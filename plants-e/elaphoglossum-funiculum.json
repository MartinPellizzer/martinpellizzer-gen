    "intro": "Elaphoglossum funiculum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps it retain moisture. Elaphoglossum funiculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
