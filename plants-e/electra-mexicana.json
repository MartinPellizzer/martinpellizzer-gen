    "intro": "Electra mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a bushy appearance. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Electra mexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
