    "intro": "Echinopsilon sericeus, commonly known as the silky echinops, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its silky, silver-green leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
