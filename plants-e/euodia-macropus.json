    "intro": "Euodia macropus, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Euodia macropus is often found in tropical and subtropical forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its hard, dense wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
