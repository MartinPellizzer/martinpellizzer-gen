    "intro": "Echinodorus cordifolius var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green and slightly wavy in appearance. This variety is well adapted to freshwater environments and thrives in moderate to high light conditions. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense underwater vegetation."
