    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a perennial fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Elaphoglossum crassifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
