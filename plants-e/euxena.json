It is characterized by its erect or spreading shrub-like growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine pubescence. Euxena species produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, warty seeds."
