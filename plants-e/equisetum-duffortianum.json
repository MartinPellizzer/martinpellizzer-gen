    "intro": "Equisetum duffortianum, commonly known as the Duffort's horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinctive spore-producing cone at the tip of its stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies. It has a unique structure with jointed stems and is one of the few remaining plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds. Equisetum duffortianum is also notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
