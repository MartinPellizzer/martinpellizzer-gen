    "intro": "Elaeocarpus aberrans, commonly known as the New Caledonian elaeocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically encased in a fleshy, persistent calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
