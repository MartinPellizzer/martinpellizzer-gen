    "intro": "Euphorbia klokoviana, commonly known as the Russian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia klokoviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
