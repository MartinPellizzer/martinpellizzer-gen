It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that surround the small, blue-violet flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for pandan leaves due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
