    "intro": "Epiphyllum crispatum, commonly known as the crown of thorns or zigzag cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces showy, nocturnal blooms that are typically pink or white, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its stems are adapted to climb and can grow along trees or rocks, making it an epiphytic species. Epiphyllum crispatum is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
