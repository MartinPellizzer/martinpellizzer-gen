    "intro": "Ephemerantha dura, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ephemerantha dura is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought."
