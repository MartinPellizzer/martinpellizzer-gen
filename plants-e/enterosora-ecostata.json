    "intro": "Enterosora ecostata, commonly known as the coastal enterosora, is a rare flowering plant native to the sandy shores of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to stabilize itself in loose, coastal soils. It is often found growing in clusters along the edges of tidal zones, where it tolerates salt spray and periodic flooding. Due to habitat loss, Enterosora ecostata is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
