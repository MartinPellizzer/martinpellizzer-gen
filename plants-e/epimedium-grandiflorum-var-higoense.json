    "intro": "Epimedium grandiflorum var. higoense, commonly known as the Higoense barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, reddish-brown flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the subtle, long-lasting floral display."
