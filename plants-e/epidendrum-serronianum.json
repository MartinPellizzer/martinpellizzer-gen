    "intro": "Epidendrum serronianum, commonly known as the Serrona Mountain Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and numerous, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
