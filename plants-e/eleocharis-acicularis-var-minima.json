    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. minima, commonly known as the narrow spike sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tiny, clustered spikes of flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, spikelet-like structures that are often wind-pollinated. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family, sharing similar morphological features and ecological preferences."
