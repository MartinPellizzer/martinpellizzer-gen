    "intro": "Enomegra hispida, commonly known as the rough-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. Enomegra hispida typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
