    "intro": "Eupatorium fragile, commonly known as slender boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eupatorium fragile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
