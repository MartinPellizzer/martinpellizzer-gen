It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Ernestia lata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
