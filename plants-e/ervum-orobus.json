    "intro": "Ervum orobus, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Ervum orobus is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen through root nodules makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
