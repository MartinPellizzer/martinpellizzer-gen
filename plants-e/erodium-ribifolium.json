    "intro": "Erodium ribifolium, commonly known as the redstem bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small annual herb with slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Erodium ribifolium is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and grasslands."
