    "intro": "Eragrostis major var. subbiloba, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
