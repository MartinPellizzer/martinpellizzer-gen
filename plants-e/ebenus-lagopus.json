    "intro": "Ebenus lagopus, commonly known as the snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Ebenus lagopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
