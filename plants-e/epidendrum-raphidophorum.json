    "intro": "Epidendrum raphidophorum, commonly known as the green spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright green, spider-like flowers that are distinctive in appearance. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-shaped, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Epidendrum raphidophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
