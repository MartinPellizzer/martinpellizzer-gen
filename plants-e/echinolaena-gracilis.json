    "intro": "Echinolaena gracilis, commonly known as slender echinolaena, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bracteate, spiky flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Echinolaena gracilis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
