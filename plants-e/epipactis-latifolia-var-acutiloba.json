    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epipactis latifolia."
