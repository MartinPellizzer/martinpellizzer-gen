    "intro": "Eriosorus ruizianus, commonly known as the Ruiz's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded lobes along the margins. Eriosorus ruizianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
