    "intro": "Evolvulus rotundifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-tomentose leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
