    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain irritants."
