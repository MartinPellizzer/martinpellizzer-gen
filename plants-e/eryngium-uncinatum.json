    "intro": "Eryngium uncinatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has a basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium uncinatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
