    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. phoenicea, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from green to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a unique, spurred lip on its flowers, which is a common feature among orchids. This variety is distinguished by its reddish tones, which set it apart from the more typical greenish hue of the standard helleborine."
