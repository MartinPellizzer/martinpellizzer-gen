    "intro": "Espeletia hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's espeletia, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a rosette-forming plant with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
