    "intro": "Elymus glaucus subsp. jepsonii, commonly known as Jepson's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are often hairy and glabrous above. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
