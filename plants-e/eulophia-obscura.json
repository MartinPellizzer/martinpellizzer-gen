    "intro": "Eulophia obscura, commonly known as the dark eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
