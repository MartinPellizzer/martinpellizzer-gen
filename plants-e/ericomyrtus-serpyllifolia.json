    "intro": "Ericomyrtus serpyllifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Ericomyrtus serpyllifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
