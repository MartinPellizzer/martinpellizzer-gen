    "intro": "Epidendrum globosum, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Epidendrum globosum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
