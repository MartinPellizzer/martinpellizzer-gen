    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudotrinervis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
