    "intro": "Euphorbia teskensuensis, commonly known as the Teshikoustan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating. Euphorbia teskensuensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
