It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that have a distinctive wavy or serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
