    "intro": "Ericoides stagnale, commonly known as the marsh heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland environments. It typically features small, leathery leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Ericoides stagnale thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor conditions and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its root system helps stabilize soil and supports a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms and invertebrates."
