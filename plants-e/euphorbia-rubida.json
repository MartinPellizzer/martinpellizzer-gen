    "intro": "Euphorbia rubida, commonly known as the red-spotted euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red and green spiny stems and yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Euphorbia rubida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
