    "intro": "Eucalyptus insularis, commonly known as the island gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, usually with a blue-green hue and a rough upper surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellowish-white. This species is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat and is often found in forested areas."
