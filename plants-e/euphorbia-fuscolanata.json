    "intro": "Euphorbia fuscolanata, commonly known as the dark-leaved spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, woody stems covered in a smooth, dark green bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Euphorbia fuscolanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
