    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. ripense, commonly known as the riparian horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streams, rivers, and wetlands. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
