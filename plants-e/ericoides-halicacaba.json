    "intro": "Ericoides halicacaba, commonly known as the sweet willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The sweet willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
