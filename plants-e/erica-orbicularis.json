    "intro": "Erica orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to western South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica orbicularis is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
