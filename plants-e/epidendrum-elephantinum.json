    "intro": "Epidendrum elephantinum, commonly known as the elephant's trunk orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, fleshy, elephant-trunk-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Epidendrum elephantinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
