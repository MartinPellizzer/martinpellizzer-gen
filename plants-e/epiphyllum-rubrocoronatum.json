    "intro": "Epiphyllum rubrocoronatum, commonly known as the red-capped night bloomer, is a species of cactus belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, opening at night and closing in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
