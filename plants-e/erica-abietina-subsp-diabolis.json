    "intro": "Erica abietina subsp. diabolis, commonly known as the Devil's Heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or heathland environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
