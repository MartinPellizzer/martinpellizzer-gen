It features a slender, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous, greenish-white flowers with yellow and brown markings, typical of the genus Eulophia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions."
