    "intro": "Epipactis provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial helleborine, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
