    "intro": "Elegia paniculata, commonly known as the sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems topped with dense, spike-like clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Elegia paniculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
