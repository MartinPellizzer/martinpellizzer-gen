    "intro": "Epidendrum regnellianum, commonly known as the Regnell's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Epidendrum regnellianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
