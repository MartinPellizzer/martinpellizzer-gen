    "intro": "Erythroxylum acranthum, commonly known as the red coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is part of the Erythroxylaceae family, which includes other species known for their psychoactive properties. Due to its potential for illicit use, it is often regulated in regions where it is found."
