    "intro": "Eugenia palauensis, commonly known as the Palau guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Palau."
