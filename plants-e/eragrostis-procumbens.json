    "intro": "Eragrostis procumbens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to various regions of Africa. It features fine, silver-haired leaves that give it its common name, and it typically forms dense mats or cushions on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
