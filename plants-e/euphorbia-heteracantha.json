    "intro": "Euphorbia heteracantha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems covered in a thick layer of pale green, waxy bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
