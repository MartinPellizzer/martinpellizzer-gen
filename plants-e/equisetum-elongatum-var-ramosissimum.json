    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in soft, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of its primitive evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
