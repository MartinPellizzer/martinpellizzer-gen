    "intro": "Echinocereus adustus, commonly known as the desert night bloomer or hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are ribbed and covered with clusters of spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Echinocereus adustus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and striking example of desert flora."
