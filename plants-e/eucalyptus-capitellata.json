    "intro": "Eucalyptus capitellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malletwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, peeling bark that becomes fibrous with age. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue and a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators. The plant is valued for its timber and has some medicinal uses due to the presence of eucalyptus oils."
