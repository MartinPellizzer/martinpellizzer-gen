    "intro": "Euphorbia floridana, commonly known as the Florida spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a succulent, branching stem covered in soft, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a characteristic plant of Florida's wetland ecosystems."
