    "intro": "Epidendrum polyanthum var. myodes, commonly known as the Myodes Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
