    "intro": "Eupatorium venulosum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically opposite and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium venulosum is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to stabilize soil."
