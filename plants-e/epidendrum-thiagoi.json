    "intro": "Epidendrum thiagoi, commonly known as the Thiago's Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can access sufficient light for photosynthesis. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Epidendrum thiagoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
