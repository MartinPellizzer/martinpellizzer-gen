    "intro": "Eryngium campestre, commonly known as field thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces tall, spiny stems topped with spherical, blue to purple flower heads composed of small, petal-less flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a notable wildflower in its native habitats."
