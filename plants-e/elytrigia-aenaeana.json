    "intro": "Elytrigia aenaeana, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elytrigia aenaeana is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat for small invertebrates."
