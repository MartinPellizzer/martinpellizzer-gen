    "intro": "Eriosyce occulta, commonly known as the hidden eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriosyce occulta is considered a rare and endangered species."
