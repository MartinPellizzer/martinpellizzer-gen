    "intro": "Elaphoglossum drabifolium, commonly known as the gray fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a powdery, grayish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum drabifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
