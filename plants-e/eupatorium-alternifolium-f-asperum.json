    "intro": "Eupatorium alternifolium f. asperum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, rough-textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its common name reflects the rugged texture of its foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the Eupatorium genus."
