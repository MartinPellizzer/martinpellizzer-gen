    "intro": "Euphorbia primulifolia, commonly known as the spring beauty euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
