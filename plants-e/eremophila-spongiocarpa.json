    "intro": "Eremophila spongiocarpa, commonly known as the spongebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Eremophila spongiocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
