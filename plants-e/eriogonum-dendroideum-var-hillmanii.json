    "intro": "Eriogonum dendroideum var. hillmanii, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in open habitats such as slopes and chaparral, contributing to local biodiversity."
