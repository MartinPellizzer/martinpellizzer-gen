    "intro": "Echinocactus lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
