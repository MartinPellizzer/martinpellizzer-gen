    "intro": "Euodia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered euodia, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their subdued color. Its fruits are small, round drupes that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Euodia viridiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched species in the genus."
