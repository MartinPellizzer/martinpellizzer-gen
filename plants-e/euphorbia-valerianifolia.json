It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental appeal and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
