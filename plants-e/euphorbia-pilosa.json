    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, dark green leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
