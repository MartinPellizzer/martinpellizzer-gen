    "intro": "Elymus caninus, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly pressed together, with bristle-like awns at the tips of the florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus caninus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
