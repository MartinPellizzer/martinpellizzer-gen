It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
