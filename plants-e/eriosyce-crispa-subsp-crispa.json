    "intro": "Eriosyce crispa subsp. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
