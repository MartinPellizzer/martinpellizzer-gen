    "intro": "Erophila confinis, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Erophila confinis is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
