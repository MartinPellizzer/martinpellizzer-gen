    "intro": "Ephedra torreyana var. torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's ephedra, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers that are clustered in cones, typical of the Ephedraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of botanical and pharmacological study."
