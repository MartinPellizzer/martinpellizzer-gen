    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. elongatiformis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
