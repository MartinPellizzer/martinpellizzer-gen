    "intro": "Erigeron filifolius var. typicus, commonly known as the threadleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers with a central disk, and its seed heads are often visited by bees and other pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
