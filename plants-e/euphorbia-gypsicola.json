    "intro": "Euphorbia gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are followed by distinctive cyathia, a type of modified inflorescence. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, Euphorbia gypsicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with low maintenance requirements."
