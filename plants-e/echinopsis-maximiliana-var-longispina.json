    "intro": "Echinopsis maximiliana var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
