    "intro": "Echiochilon kotschyi var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved echiochilon, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration in semi-arid environments."
