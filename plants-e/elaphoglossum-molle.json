    "intro": "Elaphoglossum molle, commonly known as the soft holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Elaphoglossum molle is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
