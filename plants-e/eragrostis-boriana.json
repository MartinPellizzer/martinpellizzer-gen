    "intro": "Eragrostis boriana, commonly known as the mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and female flowers, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Eragrostis boriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
