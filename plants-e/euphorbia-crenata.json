    "intro": "Euphorbia crenata, commonly known as the crested spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Euphorbia crenata is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant."
