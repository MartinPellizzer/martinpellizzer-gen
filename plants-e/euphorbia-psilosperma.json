    "intro": "Euphorbia psilosperma, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, erect stems covered in a fine, silky coating of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may bear small, white glandular dots. Euphorbia psilosperma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
