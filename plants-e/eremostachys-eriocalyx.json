    "intro": "Eremostachys eriocalyx, commonly known as the woolly eryngo, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Eremostachys eriocalyx is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited precipitation."
