    "intro": "Eremurus thiodanthus, commonly known as the yellow desert candle, is a striking perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like flower stalks that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with bright yellow flowers. The plant features fibrous roots and a robust stem that is often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically withering before flowering. Eremurus thiodanthus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
