    "intro": "Euphorbia multiclava, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that form dense clusters, often with a reddish or greenish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a unique defense mechanism, producing a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia multiclava is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
