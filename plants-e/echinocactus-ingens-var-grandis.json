    "intro": "Echinocactus ingens var. grandis, commonly known as the giant cardoon cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It is characterized by its massive, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant features a spiny, cylindrical stem with prominent areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the base of the stem during the spring. This species is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
