    "intro": "Eriodictyon angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved yerba santa, is a perennial shrub native to California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are used traditionally by Native American communities for their medicinal properties. Eriodictyon angustifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
