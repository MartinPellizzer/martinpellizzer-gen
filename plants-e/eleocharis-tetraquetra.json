    "intro": "Eleocharis tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-row sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-angled berries that are dispersed by water or animals. Eleocharis tetraquetra plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
