    "intro": "Elatostema palustre, commonly known as the marsh elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its wetland environment. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Elatostema palustre is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local insect populations."
