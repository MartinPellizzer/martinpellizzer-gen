    "intro": "Eriocaulon oreadum, commonly known as the mountain marsh plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually with three stamens and a single pistil. Eriocaulon oreadum is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
