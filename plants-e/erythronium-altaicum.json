    "intro": "Erythronium altaicum, commonly known as the Altai dog's mercury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a bulbous root system and produces a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant blooms in early spring with clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
