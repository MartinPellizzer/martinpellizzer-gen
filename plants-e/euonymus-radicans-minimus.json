    "intro": "Euonymus radicans minimus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different climates."
