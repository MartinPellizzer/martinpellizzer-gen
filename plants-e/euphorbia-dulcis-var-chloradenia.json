    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. chloradenia, commonly known as the sweet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically small and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
