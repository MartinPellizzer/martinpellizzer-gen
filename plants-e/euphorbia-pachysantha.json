    "intro": "Euphorbia pachysantha, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its toxic milky sap, it should be handled with care."
