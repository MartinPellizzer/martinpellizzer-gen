    "intro": "Elaeocarpus mindoroensis, commonly known as the Mindoro elaeocarpus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by distinctive blue or black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
