It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
