    "intro": "Eugenia arivoa, commonly known as the Madagascar cherry or red cherry, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, showy flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, hence its common name. Eugenia arivoa thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
