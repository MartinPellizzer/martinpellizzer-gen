    "intro": "Epilobium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, often reddish leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Epilobium pygmaeum thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and short growing seasons."
