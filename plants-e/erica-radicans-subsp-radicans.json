    "intro": "Erica radicans subsp. radicans, commonly known as the trailing heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
