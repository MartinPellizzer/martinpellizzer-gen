    "intro": "Eucalyptus gillii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a distinctive aromatic scent. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
