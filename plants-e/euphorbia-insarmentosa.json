    "intro": "Euphorbia insarmentosa, commonly known as the armed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems covered in sharp, spine-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
