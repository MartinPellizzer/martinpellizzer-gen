    "intro": "Erigeron alpicola var. kirigishiensis, commonly known as the Kirigishi alpine fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
