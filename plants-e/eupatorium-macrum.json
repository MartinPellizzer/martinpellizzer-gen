    "intro": "Eupatorium macrum, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a distinctive white or grayish underside. Eupatorium macrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
