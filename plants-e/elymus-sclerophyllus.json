    "intro": "Elymus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus sclerophyllus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its resilience to drought and cold makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
