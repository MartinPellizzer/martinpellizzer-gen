    "intro": "Echinopsis angelesiae, commonly known as the Angel's Tears cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a ribbed structure with spines that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
