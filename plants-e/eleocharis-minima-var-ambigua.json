    "intro": "Eleocharis minima var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 10 centimeters in height. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. This variant is distinguished by its morphological variability, which can make it challenging to classify compared to other members of the genus."
