    "intro": "Euphorbia herniarioides, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
