    "intro": "Epithelantha pachyrhiza subsp. elongata, commonly known as the elongated barrel cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun."
