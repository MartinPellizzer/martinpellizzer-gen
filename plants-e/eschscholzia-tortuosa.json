    "intro": "Eschscholzia tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange to red petals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, bushy form. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vivid splash of color to its natural environment."
