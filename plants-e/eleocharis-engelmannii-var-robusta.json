    "intro": "Eleocharis engelmannii var. robusta, commonly known as the robust spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions."
