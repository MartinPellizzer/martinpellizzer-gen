    "intro": "Erporkis sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles erporkis, is a unique flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often colorful inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a striking contrast between the vibrant petals and the green, leaf-like bracts. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Erporkis sechellarum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
