    "intro": "Euphorbia minuta subsp. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
