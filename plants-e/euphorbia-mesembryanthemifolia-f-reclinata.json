    "intro": "Euphorbia mesembryanthemifolia f. reclinata, commonly known as the reclining spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
