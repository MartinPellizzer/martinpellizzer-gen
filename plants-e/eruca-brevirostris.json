    "intro": "Eruca brevirostris, commonly known as the broadleaf mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky soils. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eruca brevirostris is sometimes cultivated as a leaf vegetable, though it is less commonly consumed than other mustard species."
