    "intro": "Epimedium pinnatum var. perralderianum, commonly known as the Perralderian barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in shady, moist woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
