    "intro": "Epidendrum bigibberosum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Epidendrum bigibberosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
