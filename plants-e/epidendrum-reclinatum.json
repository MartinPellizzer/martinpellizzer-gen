    "intro": "Epidendrum reclinatum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique, recurved shape. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Epidendrum reclinatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
