    "intro": "Euphorbia obliterata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has a fleshy, branching stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often shed easily, contributing to its ghostly look. Euphorbia obliterata is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
