    "intro": "Echites rhynchospermus, commonly known as the spiny devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in dry conditions. Echites rhynchospermus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments."
