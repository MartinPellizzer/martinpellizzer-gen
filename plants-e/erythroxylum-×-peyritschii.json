    "intro": "Erythroxylum \u00d7 peyritschii, commonly known as the hybrid copal tree, is a species resulting from the cross between Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum aromatum. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are often used in traditional practices and have a history of being cultivated for their stimulant properties. However, it is not as widely recognized or studied as its parent species."
