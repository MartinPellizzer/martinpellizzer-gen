    "intro": "Echinocactus columnaris, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its spiny, ribbed structure helps it conserve water in arid environments. Echinocactus columnaris is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal watering."
