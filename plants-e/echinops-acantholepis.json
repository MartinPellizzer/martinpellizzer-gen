    "intro": "Echinops acantholepis, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a small, prickly sphere. The plant has silver-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Echinops acantholepis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
