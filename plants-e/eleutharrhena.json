    "intro": "Eleutharrhena, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers are often visited by birds and insects, contributing to their pollination. Eleutharrhena species are also valued for their ornamental qualities and sometimes for their medicinal properties. The genus is relatively understudied, with many species yet to be fully described and classified."
