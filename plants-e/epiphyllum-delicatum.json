    "intro": "Epiphyllum delicatum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a climbing plant with stems that can reach several meters in length, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically elliptical and are shed as the plant matures, giving way to modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant is renowned for its large, showy flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. Despite its cactus classification, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the genus Epiphyllum, which includes many epiphytic species."
