    "intro": "Elettariopsis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elettariopsis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
