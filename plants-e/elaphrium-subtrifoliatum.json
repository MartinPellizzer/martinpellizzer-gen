    "intro": "Elaphrium subtrifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved elaphrium, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in umbels, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
