    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a unique structure known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can pose a challenge to native plant communities."
