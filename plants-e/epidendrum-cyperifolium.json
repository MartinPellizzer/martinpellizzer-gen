    "intro": "Epidendrum cyperifolium, commonly known as the Cyperus-leaved Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble those of the sedge plant, hence its common name. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum cyperifolium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
