    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. elata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, blue-green leaves and its distinctive yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is considered an invasive species in North America, particularly in the western United States. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a challenging weed to control."
