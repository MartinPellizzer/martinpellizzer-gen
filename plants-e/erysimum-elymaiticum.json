    "intro": "Erysimum elymaiticum, commonly known as the Crimean wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Europe and southwestern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Erysimum elymaiticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
