    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gayanum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum gayanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
