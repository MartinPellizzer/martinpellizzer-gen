    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peninsulare, commonly known as the Florida holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and\u4e1b\u751f, forming dense, carpet-like mats. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum peninsulare is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
