It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered, forming a compact, cushion-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its distinctive appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
