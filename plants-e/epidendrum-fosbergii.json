    "intro": "Epidendrum fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Epidendrum fosbergii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
