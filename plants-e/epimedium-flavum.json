    "intro": "Epimedium flavum, commonly known as the golden monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish or reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in late spring, usually in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium flavum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
