It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in dune systems or along shorelines. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
