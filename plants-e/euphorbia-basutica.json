    "intro": "Euphorbia basutica, commonly known as the Basutu spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia basutica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
