    "intro": "Epicampes distichophylla var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy two-ranked fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked fronds, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are complex, featuring specialized spore-bearing leaves that contribute to its unique botanical classification. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
