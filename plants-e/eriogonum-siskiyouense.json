    "intro": "Eriogonum siskiyouense, commonly known as Siskiyou buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the Klamath Mountains of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
