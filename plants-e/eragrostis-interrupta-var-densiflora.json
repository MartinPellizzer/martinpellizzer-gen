It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, drooping inflorescences that give it a weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, feathery foliage and unique growth form."
