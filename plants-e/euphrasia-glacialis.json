    "intro": "Euphrasia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier eyelid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Euphrasia glacialis is known for its pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer."
