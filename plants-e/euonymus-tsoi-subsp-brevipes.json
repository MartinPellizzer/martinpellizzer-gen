It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
