    "intro": "Elaeocarpus gummatus, commonly known as the gum elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, heavy wood. The tree also has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption."
