    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. longiseta, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial weed native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, bristly leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spiky flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to produce a large number of seeds make it a persistent weed in many environments."
