    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp. platyphyllos, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
