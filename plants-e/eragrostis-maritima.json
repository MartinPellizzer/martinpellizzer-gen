    "intro": "Eragrostis maritima, commonly known as sea oats, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Eragrostis maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
