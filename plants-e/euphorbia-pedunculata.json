    "intro": "Euphorbia pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has smooth, green stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Euphorbia pedunculata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
