    "intro": "Erucaria uncata subsp. aegiceras, commonly known as the mangrove sedges, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish environments. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and tidal mudflats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
