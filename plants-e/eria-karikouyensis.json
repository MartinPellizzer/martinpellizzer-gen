    "intro": "Eria karikouyensis, commonly known as the Karikouy Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single inflorescence with several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria karikouyensis is considered a conservation concern."
