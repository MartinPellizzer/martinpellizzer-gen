It features a short, thick stem with numerous erect, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia meuselii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
