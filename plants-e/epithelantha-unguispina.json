    "intro": "Epithelantha unguispina, commonly known as the spined columnar cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a shallow root system to survive in arid conditions. Epithelantha unguispina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
