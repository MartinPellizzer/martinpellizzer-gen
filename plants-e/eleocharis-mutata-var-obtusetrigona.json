    "intro": "Eleocharis mutata var. obtusetrigona, commonly known as the broad-angled spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets with short, broad, and often curved bracts. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It is native to parts of Asia and is also found in some regions of the Americas."
