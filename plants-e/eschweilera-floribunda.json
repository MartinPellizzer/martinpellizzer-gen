    "intro": "Eschweilera floribunda, commonly known as the pink-veined evergreen, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive pink veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
