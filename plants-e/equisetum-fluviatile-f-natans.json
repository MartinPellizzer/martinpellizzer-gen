    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. natans, commonly known as water horsetail, is a aquatic fern-like plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile strobili, which are cone-like structures that produce spores. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in aquatic ecosystems."
