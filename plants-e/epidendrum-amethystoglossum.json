    "intro": "Epidendrum amethystoglossum, commonly known as the amethyst-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with a distinctive amethyst-colored lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Epidendrum amethystoglossum prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
