It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable plant for arid landscape designs."
