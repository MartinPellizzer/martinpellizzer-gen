    "intro": "Erithalis harrisii var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf erithalis, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
