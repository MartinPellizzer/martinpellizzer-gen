    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Eriogonum umbellatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in arid and semi-arid regions."
