    "intro": "Empusella juddii, commonly known as the Judd's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leafy appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
