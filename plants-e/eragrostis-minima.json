    "intro": "Eragrostis minima, commonly known as little barleygrass, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Eragrostis minima is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
