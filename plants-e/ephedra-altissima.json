    "intro": "Ephedra altissima, commonly known as the tall ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically absent except during certain growth stages. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Ephedra altissima thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
