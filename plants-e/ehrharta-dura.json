    "intro": "Ehrharta dura, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Ehrharta dura is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. It is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
