    "intro": "Euphorbia baselicis subsp. thessala, commonly known as the Thessalian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
