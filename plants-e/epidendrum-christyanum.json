    "intro": "Epidendrum christyanum, commonly known as the Christyan's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
