    "intro": "Euphorbia gebelica, commonly known as the Sinai spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia gebelica is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
