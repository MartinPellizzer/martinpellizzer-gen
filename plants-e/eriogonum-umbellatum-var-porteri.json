It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
