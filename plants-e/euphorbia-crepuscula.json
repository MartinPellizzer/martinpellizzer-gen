    "intro": "Euphorbia crepuscula, commonly known as the evening euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which appear in the late afternoon or evening, hence its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
