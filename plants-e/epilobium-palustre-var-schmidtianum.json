    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. schmidtianum, commonly known as the Schmidt's willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
