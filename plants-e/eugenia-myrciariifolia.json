    "intro": "Eugenia myrciariifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
