It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
