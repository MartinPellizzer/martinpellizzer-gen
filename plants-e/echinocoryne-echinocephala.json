    "intro": "Echinocoryne echinocephala, commonly known as the horned coralroot, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescence and its striking, horn-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
