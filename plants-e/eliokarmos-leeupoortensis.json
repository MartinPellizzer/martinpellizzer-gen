    "intro": "Eliokarmos leeupoortensis, commonly known as the Leeupoort sandbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from lower soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
