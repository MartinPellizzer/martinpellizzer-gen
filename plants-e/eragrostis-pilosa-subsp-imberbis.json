    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa subsp. imberbis, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, wiry inflorescences that are often pink to purple in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are typically arranged in a panicle. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common species in dryland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland vegetation in its native range."
