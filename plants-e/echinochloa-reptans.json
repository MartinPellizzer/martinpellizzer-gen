    "intro": "Echinochloa reptans, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u725b\u7b4b\u8349, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with nodes that root at the base, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wet or disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in marshy areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural settings."
