    "intro": "Erythronium vernale, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the woodlands of eastern North America. It produces delicate, nodding flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to naturalize and create a carpet of white flowers in the spring."
