    "intro": "Elaphoglossum discolor, commonly known as the variable harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum discolor is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
