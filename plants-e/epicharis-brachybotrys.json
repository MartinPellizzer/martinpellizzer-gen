    "intro": "Epicharis brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stalked epicharis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Epicharis brachybotrys is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
