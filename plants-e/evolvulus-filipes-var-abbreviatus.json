    "intro": "Evolvulus filipes var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed morning glory, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful cover plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
