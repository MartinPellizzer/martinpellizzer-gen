It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. Erythrina arborea produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can also be used in traditional medicine."
