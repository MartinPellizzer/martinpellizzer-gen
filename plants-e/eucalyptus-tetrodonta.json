    "intro": "Eucalyptus tetrodonta, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Eucalyptus tetrodonta is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree, commonly found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its aromatic oils have been used in traditional medicine and for their insect-repelling properties."
