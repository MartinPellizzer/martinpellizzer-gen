    "intro": "Epidorkis pectinata, commonly known as the sticky cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin that has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for various purposes. Epidorkis pectinata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and medicinal studies."
