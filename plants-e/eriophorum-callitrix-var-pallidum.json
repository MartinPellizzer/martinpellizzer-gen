It is characterized by its soft, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often covered in a fine, silky layer of hairs. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
