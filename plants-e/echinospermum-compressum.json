    "intro": "Echinospermum compressum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a head, similar to other members of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Echinospermum compressum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
