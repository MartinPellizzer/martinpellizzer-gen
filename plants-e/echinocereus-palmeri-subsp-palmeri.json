    "intro": "Echinocereus palmeri subsp. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with prominent, spiny areoles and typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which helps protect it from herbivores and reduces water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This cactus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
