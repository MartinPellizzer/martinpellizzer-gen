    "intro": "Eurygania biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered eurygania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Eurygania biflora has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
