    "intro": "Eleocharis incurvata, commonly known as the bent spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical inflorescence that curves downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in its survival in waterlogged conditions. Eleocharis incurvata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
