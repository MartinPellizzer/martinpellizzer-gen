    "intro": "Enneastemon foliosus var. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty leaf enneastemon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a reddish-brown hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
