    "intro": "Eugenia victoriana, commonly known as the Victoria's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. After flowering, it produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia victoriana plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
