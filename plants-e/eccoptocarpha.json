It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, terminal flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually yellow and are followed by a pappus of bristles that aid in seed dispersal. Eccoptocarpha species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
