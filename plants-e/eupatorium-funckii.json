    "intro": "Eupatorium funckii, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, lavender to white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium funckii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
