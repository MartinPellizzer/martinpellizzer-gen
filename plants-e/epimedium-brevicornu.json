    "intro": "Epimedium brevicornu, commonly known as the barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features rhizomatous growth and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in horticulture for its foliage and early bloom."
