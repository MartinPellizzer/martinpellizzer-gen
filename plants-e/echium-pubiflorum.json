    "intro": "Echium pubiflorum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Echium pubiflorum is a hardy species well adapted to drought and high temperatures."
