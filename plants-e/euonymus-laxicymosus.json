    "intro": "Euonymus laxicymosus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a shrub native to East Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental and attract birds. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
