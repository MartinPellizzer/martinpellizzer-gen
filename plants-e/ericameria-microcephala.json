    "intro": "Ericameria microcephala, commonly known as silverleaf ericoid, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. The plant features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Ericameria microcephala is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
