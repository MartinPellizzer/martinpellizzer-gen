    "intro": "Eriosorus paucifolius var. steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's brittle fern, is a variant of the brittle fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. Its leaves are usually short and compact, with a distinctive, brittle texture. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops."
