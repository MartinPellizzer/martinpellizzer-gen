    "intro": "Elaphoglossum delgadilloanum, commonly known as the Delgadillo holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rock crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among ferns."
