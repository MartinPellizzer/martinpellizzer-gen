    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and basal rosettes of fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in high-elevation environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient and adaptable species within its native range."
