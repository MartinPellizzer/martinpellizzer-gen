    "intro": "Elytrigia pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Elytrigia pycnantha is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
