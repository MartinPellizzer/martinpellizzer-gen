    "intro": "Elleanthus gastroglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its root system is fibrous and often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
