    "intro": "Exandra rhodoclada, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it absorb oxygen from the water. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Exandra rhodoclada plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
