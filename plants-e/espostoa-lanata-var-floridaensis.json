    "intro": "Espostoa lanata var. floridaensis, commonly known as the Florida woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
