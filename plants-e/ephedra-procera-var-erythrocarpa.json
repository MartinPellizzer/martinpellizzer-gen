    "intro": "Ephedra procera var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the coniferous plants. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
