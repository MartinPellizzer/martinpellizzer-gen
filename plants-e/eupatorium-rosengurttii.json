    "intro": "Eupatorium rosengurttii, commonly known as the Rosengurt's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Eupatorium rosengurttii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
