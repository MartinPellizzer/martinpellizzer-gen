    "intro": "Epilobium amenum, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in racemes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Epilobium amenum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
