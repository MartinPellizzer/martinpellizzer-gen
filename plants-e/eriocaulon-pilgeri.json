    "intro": "Eriocaulon pilgeri, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in its survival in waterlogged conditions. Eriocaulon pilgeri plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
