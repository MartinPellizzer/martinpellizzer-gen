    "intro": "Eriogonum pendulum var. typicum, commonly known as the hanging buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
