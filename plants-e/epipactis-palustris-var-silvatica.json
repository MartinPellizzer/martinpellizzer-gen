    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. silvatica, commonly known as the woodland helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded forest habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in rich, organic soils. It is a perennial herb that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable environments. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
