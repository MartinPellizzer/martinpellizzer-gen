    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum, commonly known as woolly sunflower, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, white to silver-gray fuzzy foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit with woody stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable plant in native landscaping."
