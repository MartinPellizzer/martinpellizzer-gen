    "intro": "Euphorbia triumfetti, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are not showy but are followed by bright red berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its spines, it requires careful handling to avoid injury."
