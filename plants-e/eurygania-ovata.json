    "intro": "Eurygania ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has elongated, oval-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Eurygania ovata plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and other small organisms."
