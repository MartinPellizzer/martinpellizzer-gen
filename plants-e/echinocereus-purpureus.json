    "intro": "Echinocereus purpureus, commonly known as the purple hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
