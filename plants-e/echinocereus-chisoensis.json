    "intro": "Echinocereus chisoensis, commonly known as the Chisos hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chisos Mountains in Texas. It is a small, spine-covered cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne in the axils of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
