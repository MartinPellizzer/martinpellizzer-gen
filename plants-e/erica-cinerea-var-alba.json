    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. alba, commonly known as white heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its white blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
