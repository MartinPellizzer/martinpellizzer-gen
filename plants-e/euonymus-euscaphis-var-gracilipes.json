    "intro": "Euonymus euscaphis var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental and attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
