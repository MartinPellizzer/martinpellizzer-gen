    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as common spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
