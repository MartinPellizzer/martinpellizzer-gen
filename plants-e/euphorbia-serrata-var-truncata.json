    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its toxic sap contains latex, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
