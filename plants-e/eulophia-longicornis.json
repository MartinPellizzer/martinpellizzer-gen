    "intro": "Eulophia longicornis, commonly known as the long-horned orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure includes a long, slender lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Eulophia longicornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
