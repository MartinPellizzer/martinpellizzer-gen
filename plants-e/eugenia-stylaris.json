    "intro": "Eugenia stylaris, commonly known as the slender guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. The fruits are edible, with a sweet, tangy flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Eugenia stylaris is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological and economic significance in its native habitat."
