    "intro": "Eupatorium sulcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf boneset, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Eupatorium sulcatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
