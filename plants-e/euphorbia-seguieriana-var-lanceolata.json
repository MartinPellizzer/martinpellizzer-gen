    "intro": "Euphorbia seguieriana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
