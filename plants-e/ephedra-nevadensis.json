    "intro": "Ephedra nevadensis, commonly known as the Great Basin ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in rocky soils and sagebrush steppe habitats. Ephedra nevadensis is part of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the gymnosperms. It has historical significance in traditional medicine but is now primarily of interest for ecological and botanical study."
