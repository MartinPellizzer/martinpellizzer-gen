    "intro": "Endoptera dioscoridis, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces long, slender stems that can climb using tendrils, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often heart-shaped. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
