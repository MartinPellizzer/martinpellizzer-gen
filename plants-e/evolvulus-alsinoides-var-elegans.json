    "intro": "Evolvulus alsinoides var. elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a decorative plant and a potential weed."
