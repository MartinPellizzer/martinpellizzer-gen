    "intro": "Epidendrum dunstervilleorum, commonly known as the Dunsterville orchid, is a species native to Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and greenhouses."
