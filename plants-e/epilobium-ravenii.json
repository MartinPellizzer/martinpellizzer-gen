It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. It typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Epilobium ravenii is an important species in New Zealand's native flora, often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
