    "intro": "Eriogonum scapigerum, commonly known as the scapigerous buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eriogonum scapigerum is a member of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive seed structures and ecological importance to pollinators."
