    "intro": "Elaphoglossum adenolepis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori that are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. Elaphoglossum adenolepis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
