    "intro": "Equisetum wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, or cones, at the top of the stem, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fossil record dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
