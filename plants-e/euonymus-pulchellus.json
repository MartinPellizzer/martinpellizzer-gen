    "intro": "Euonymus pulchellus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage. Euonymus pulchellus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
