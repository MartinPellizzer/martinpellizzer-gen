It features a cylindrical stem that is typically green to reddish in color, often with a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to arid environments. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions with minimal rainfall."
