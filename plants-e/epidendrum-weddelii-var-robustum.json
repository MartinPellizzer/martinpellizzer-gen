    "intro": "Epidendrum weddelii var. robustum, commonly known as the robust epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
