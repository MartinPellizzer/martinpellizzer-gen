    "intro": "Eriotheca glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriotheca glabrescens is often found in moist, shady environments and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
