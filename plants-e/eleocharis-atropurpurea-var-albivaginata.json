    "intro": "Eleocharis atropurpurea var. albivaginata, commonly known as the white-banded spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often bear white or pale pink inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually reduced to small sheaths, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its pale-colored bracts, which contrast with the darker stems of the typical variety."
