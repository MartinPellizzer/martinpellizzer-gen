    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and requires caution when handling."
