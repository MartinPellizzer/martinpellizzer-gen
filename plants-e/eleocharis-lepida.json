    "intro": "Eleocharis lepida, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help stabilize the soil. Eleocharis lepida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats."
