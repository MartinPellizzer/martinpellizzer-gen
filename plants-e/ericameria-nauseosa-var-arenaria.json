    "intro": "Ericameria nauseosa var. arenaria, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and grayish, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which provide protection against intense sunlight and drought. Ericameria nauseosa var. arenaria plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in desert ecosystems."
