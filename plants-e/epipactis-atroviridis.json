    "intro": "Epipactis atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
