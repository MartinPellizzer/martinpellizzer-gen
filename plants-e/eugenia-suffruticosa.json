    "intro": "Eugenia suffruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is adapted to warm, humid climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
