    "intro": "Eucalyptus gongylocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and small, rounded buds. The tree typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often forming dense clusters in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale or white, and it produces woody capsules that contain aromatic, fibrous seeds. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
