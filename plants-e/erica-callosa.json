    "intro": "Erica callosa, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a waxy, sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica callosa produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
