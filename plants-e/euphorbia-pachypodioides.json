    "intro": "Euphorbia pachypodioides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy stem that resembles a tree, often branching into multiple trunks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its thick, waxy leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Euphorbia pachypodioides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
