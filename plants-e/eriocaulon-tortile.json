    "intro": "Eriocaulon tortile, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, spirally twisted stems that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered at the base of the stems, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Eriocaulon tortile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
