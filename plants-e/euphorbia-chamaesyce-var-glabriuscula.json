    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It features small, green, fleshy leaves that are usually smooth and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, rocky areas. Due to its milky sap, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care."
