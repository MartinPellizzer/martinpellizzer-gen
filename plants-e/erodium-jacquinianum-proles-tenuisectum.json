    "intro": "Erodium jacquinianum proles tenuisectum, commonly known as the slender-fruited bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to parts of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas."
