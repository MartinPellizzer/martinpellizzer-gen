    "intro": "Euphorbia greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spineless stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
