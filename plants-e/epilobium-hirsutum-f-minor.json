    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum f. minor, commonly known as the woolly willow or dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other damp environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
