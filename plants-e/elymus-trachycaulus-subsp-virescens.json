    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. virescens, commonly known as greenleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, bright green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with awns that are often shorter than the lemma. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock and a component of native plant communities."
