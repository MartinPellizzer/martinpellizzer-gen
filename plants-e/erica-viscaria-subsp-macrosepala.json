    "intro": "Erica viscaria subsp. macrosepala, commonly known as the large-sepal heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
