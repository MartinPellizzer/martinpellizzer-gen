    "intro": "Euphorbia carpasus, commonly known as the Carpathian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a crown of bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners interested in low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
