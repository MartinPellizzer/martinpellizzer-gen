    "intro": "Eucalyptus abbreviata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually pale or creamy white, with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
