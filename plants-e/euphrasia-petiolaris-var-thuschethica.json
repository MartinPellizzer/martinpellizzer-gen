    "intro": "Euphrasia petiolaris var. thuschethica, commonly known as the slender pusley, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, hood-like petals and a spurred lower lip, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming season, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
