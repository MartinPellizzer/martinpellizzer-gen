    "intro": "Eulophia paniculata, commonly known as the panicled eulophia, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Eulophia paniculata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources."
