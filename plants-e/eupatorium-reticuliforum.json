    "intro": "Eupatorium reticuliforum, commonly known as the laceleaf eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Eupatorium reticuliforum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
