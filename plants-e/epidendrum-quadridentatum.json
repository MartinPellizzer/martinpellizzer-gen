    "intro": "Epidendrum quadridentatum, commonly known as the Four-Toothed Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly waxy in appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum quadridentatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
