It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical shape and is covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically reduced to spines, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. Eriosphaera species are adapted to arid environments and store water in their thick, fleshy stems. These plants are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
