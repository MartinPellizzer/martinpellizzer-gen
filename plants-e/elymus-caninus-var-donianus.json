    "intro": "Elymus caninus var. donianus, commonly known as the Donian wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with rough, hairy leaves, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
