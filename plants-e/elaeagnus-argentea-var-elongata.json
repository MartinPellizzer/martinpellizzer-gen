It is characterized by its silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful for soil stabilization and as a hedging plant."
