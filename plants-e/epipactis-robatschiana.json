It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal relationships with specific fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
