It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
