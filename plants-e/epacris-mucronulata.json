    "intro": "Epacris mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. Epacris mucronulata is often used in rock gardens and native plant collections due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
