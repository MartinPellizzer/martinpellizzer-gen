    "intro": "Epidendrum tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum tuberosum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its resilience and ornamental value."
