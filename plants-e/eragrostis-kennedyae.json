It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
