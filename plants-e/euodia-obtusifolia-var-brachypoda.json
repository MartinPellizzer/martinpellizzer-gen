    "intro": "Euodia obtusifolia var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Euodia obtusifolia."
