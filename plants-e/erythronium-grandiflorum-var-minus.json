    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features rhizomatous growth and produces showy, nodding flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in meadows and forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems."
