    "intro": "Euphrasia \u00d7 murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid eyebright, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, combining species from Euphrasia, with \"murbeckii\" honoring the botanist who first described it. Euphrasia \u00d7 murbeckii is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
