    "intro": "Erica calcareophila, commonly known as the limestone heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs. This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or limestone outcrops. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant is well-suited to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
