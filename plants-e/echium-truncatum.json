    "intro": "Echium truncatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium truncatum is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
