    "intro": "Erica strigosa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are borne in compact spikes. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica strigosa is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
