It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically produces a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and has a short flowering period in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively easy-to-grow plant for rock gardens and native plant collections."
