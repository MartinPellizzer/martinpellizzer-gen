    "intro": "Eriochrysis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, blade-like fronds that are typically long and narrow. This marine plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in rocky substrates or on tidal flats. Its structure consists of a thallus with a central axis and branching filaments, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Eriochrysis longifolia plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
