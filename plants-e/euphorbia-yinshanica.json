    "intro": "Euphorbia yinshanica, commonly known as the Yinshan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern China. It features a caudex, which is a thickened stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be green or tinged with red, depending on environmental conditions. Euphorbia yinshanica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
