    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudopeplus, commonly known as common spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. Euphorbia pseudopeplus is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
