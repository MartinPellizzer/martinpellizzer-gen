    "intro": "Equisetum debile var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horse tail, is a primitive fern-like plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures rather than true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and forests. This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its simple, unchanging morphology."
