    "intro": "Euphorbia proadoa, commonly known as the Proadoa spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a spiny, branched structure that helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate. Euphorbia proadoa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
