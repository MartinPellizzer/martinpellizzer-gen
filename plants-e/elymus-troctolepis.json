    "intro": "Elymus troctolepis, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Elymus troctolepis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
