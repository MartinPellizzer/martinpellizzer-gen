    "intro": "Eugenia cotinifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
