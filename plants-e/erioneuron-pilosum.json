    "intro": "Erioneuron pilosum, commonly known as the hairy erioneuron, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
