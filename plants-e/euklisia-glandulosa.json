    "intro": "Euklisia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it should be handled with care."
