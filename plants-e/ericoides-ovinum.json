    "intro": "Ericoides ovinum, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Ericoides ovinum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
