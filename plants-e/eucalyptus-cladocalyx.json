    "intro": "Eucalyptus cladocalyx, commonly known as the apple gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, spherical white flowers that are clustered in groups of up to 10, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green color with a white coating. The tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some medicinal uses due to its aromatic oils."
