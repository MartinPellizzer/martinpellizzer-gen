It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, often reddish stems and lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have five petals, typically pink or reddish in color. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
