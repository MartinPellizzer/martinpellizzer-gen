    "intro": "Eucalyptus croajingolensis, commonly known as the coastal mallees, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in heathlands and sand dunes. Eucalyptus croajingolensis is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
