    "intro": "Eriachne glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular eriachne, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in small, glandular structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal dunes. Eriachne glandulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and small fauna."
