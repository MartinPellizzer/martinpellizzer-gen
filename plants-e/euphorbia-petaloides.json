    "intro": "Euphorbia petaloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
