    "intro": "Echinospartum barnadesii var. erinaceum, commonly known as the erinaceum echinospartum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
