    "intro": "Elaphrium bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphrium bipinnatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
