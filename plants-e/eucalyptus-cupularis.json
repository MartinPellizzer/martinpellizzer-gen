    "intro": "Eucalyptus cupularis, commonly known as the white box eucalypt, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a grey-green hue with a whitish underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
