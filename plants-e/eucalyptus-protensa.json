    "intro": "Eucalyptus protensa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white or pale yellow flowers. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Eucalyptus protensa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
