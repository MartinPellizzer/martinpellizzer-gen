    "intro": "Euphorbia congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its distinctive floral structures. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia congestiflora is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
