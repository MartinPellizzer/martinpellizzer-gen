    "intro": "Eurya shaolinchiensis, commonly known as the Shaolin evergreen tea plant, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
