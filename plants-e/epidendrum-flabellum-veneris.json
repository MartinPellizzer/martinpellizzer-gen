    "intro": "Epidendrum flabellum-veneris, commonly known as the Venus's Fan Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fan-shaped inflorescence that displays a variety of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually clustered in a dense, fan-like arrangement, and it blooms throughout the year in suitable conditions. The leaves are broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
