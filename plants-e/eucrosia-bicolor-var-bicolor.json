It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting purple or red base. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring strap-like, grassy leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
