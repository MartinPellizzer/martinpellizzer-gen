    "intro": "Euphorbia esquirolii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and diverse morphological adaptations. Euphorbia esquirolii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
