    "intro": "Exostema valenzuelae subsp. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's exostema, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a structure typical of the Malvaceae family, and it produces capsules as its fruiting body. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
