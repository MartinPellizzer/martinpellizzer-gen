    "intro": "Elaphoglossum oblanceolatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
