    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
