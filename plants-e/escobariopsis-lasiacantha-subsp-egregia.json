The plant exhibits a unique morphology with leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in moist, rocky soils in montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
