    "intro": "Epidendrum lagenocolumna, commonly known as the columnar epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum lagenocolumna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
