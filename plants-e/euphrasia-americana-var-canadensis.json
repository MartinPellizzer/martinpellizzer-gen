    "intro": "Euphrasia americana var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian eyebright, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its name derives from the appearance of its flowers, which resemble tiny eyes, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
