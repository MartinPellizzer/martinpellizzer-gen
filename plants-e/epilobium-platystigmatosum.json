It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, typically growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support biodiversity."
