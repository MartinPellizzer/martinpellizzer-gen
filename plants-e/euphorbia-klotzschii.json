    "intro": "Euphorbia klotzschii, commonly known as the Klotzsch's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia klotzschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in drought conditions."
