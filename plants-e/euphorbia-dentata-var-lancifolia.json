    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
