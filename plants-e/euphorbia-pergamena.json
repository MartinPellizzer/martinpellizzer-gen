    "intro": "Euphorbia pergamena, commonly known as the parchment euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
