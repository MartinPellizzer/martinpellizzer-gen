    "intro": "Evax mareotica, commonly known as the Mareotic thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. Evax mareotica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain insects and birds."
