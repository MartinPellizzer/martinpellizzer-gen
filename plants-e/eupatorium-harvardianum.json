    "intro": "Eupatorium harvardianum, commonly known as Harvard's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
