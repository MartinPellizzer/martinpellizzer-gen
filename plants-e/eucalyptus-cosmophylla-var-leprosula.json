    "intro": "Eucalyptus cosmophylla var. leprosula, commonly known as the white gum or narrow-leafed mallees, is a species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often whitish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy or loamy soils. This variety is part of the broader Eucalyptus cosmophylla species group, which includes several other closely related taxa with similar ecological and botanical traits."
