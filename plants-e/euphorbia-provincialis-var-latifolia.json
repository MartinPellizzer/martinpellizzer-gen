    "intro": "Euphorbia provincialis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
