    "intro": "Eucalyptus multiflora var. bivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. This variety is part of the Eucalyptus multiflora species complex, which includes several other variants with similar ecological and botanical features."
