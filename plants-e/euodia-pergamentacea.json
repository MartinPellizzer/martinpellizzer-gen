    "intro": "Euodia pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment leaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often pale green to greyish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Euodia pergamentacea is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
