    "intro": "Ericoides imbricatum, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides imbricatum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is an important component of the ecological community in its native range, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
