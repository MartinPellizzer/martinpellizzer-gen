    "intro": "Epilobium decumbens, commonly known as creeping willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, often calcareous soils. Epilobium decumbens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
