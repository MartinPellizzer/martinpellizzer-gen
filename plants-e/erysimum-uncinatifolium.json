    "intro": "Erysimum uncinatifolium, commonly known as the hooked-leaf wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that often have small hooks at the ends. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Erysimum uncinatifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
