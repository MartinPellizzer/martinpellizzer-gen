    "intro": "Echinopsis misleyi, commonly known as the Misley's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white spines. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Echinopsis misleyi is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
