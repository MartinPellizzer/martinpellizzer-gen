    "intro": "Euphorbia stricta subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. It is known for its succulent stems, which store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The species is also noted for its toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation."
