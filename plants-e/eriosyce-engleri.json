    "intro": "Eriosyce engleri, commonly known as the Engler's snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white, woolly flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, rounded shape with spiny stems that provide protection against herbivores. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to arid environments. Eriosyce engleri thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
