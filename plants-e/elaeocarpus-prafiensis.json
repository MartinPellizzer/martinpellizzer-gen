It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that enclose a single seed, typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
