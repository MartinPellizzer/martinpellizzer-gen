    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variety of the common horsetail that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense. This variety is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in shady, damp conditions."
