It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
