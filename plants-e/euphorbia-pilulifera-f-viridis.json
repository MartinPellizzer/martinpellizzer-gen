    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera f. viridis, commonly known as the green globular euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit. It features fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in rock gardens and containers."
