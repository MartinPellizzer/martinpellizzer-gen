It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in prairies and along stream banks. The plant features a tall, sparsely branched stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its most distinctive characteristic is its blue to purple spiky flower head, which resembles a thimble, hence its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
