    "intro": "Englerocharis dentata, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
