    "intro": "Eperua glabra, commonly known as the smooth eperua, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, edible seeds. Eperua glabra is valued for its hard, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
