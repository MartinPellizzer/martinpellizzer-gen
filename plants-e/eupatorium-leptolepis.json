    "intro": "Eupatorium leptolepis, commonly known as slenderleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered white flowers in the summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically used by Native Americans for its purported fever-reducing effects. The plant is also known for its strong, sometimes disagreeable scent."
