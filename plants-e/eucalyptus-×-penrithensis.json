    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 penrithensis, commonly known as the Penrith gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is typically tall and straight, with a moderate to fast growth rate, making it a popular choice for reforestation and ornamental planting. The Penrith gum is also valued for its timber, which is strong and durable, and for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
