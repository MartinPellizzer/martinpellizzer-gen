It belongs to the family Elatinaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetland environments. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.
