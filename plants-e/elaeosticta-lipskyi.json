It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with a deep root system. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
