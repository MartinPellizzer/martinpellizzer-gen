    "intro": "Eucalyptus discreta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the winter and spring seasons. Its bark is usually rough and fibrous, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Eucalyptus discreta is well adapted to drought and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
