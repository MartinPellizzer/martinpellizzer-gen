    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. ramosum, commonly known as the bracted horsehair grass, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The f. ramosum form is distinguished by its more branched and bushier growth habit compared to other forms of Equisetum kansanum."
