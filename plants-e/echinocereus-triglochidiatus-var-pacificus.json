It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance featuring a green body and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has dense, spiny stems that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its adaptability and unique appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
