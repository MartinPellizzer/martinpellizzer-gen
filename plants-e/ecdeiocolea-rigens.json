    "intro": "Ecdeiocolea rigens, commonly known as the rigid thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its sharp thorns and toxic sap, it is considered a potentially hazardous plant to handle."
