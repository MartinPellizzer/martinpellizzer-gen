    "intro": "Eulophia galbana, commonly known as the golden eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support for the inflorescence. Eulophia galbana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
