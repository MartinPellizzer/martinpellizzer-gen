    "intro": "Eupatorium lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its name derives from the brittle, easily broken stems, which resemble bones."
