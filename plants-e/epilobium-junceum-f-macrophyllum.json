    "intro": "Epilobium junceum f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. This variant is notable for its larger foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
