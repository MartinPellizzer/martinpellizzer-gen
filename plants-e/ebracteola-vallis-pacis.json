It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are lanceolate in shape and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
