    "intro": "Erica ustulescens, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its evergreen foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica ustulescens is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
