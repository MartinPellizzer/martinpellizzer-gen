    "intro": "Eugenia nitidula, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, dark purple berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Eugenia nitidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
