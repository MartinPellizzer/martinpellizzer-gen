    "intro": "Echinopanax, commonly known as the arrowleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which often have a distinctive arrowhead shape. Echinopanax species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, greenish flowers followed by berries. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their foliage."
