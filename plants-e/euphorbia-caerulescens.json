    "intro": "Euphorbia caerulescens, commonly known as the blue euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a blue-green hue and produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, typical of its succulent nature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Euphorbia caerulescens is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
