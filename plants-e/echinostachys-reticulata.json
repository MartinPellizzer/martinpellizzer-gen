    "intro": "Echinostachys reticulata, commonly known as the nettleleaf stachys, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers arranged in whorled patterns along the stem. These flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Echinostachys reticulata is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
