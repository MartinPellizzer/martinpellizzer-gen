    "intro": "Eurycles alba, commonly known as the white eurycles, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small bells. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
