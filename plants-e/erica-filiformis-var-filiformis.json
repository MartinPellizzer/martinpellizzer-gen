    "intro": "Erica filiformis var. filiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant ground cover."
