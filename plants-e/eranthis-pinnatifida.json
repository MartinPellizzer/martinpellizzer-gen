    "intro": "Eranthis pinnatifida, commonly known as the early yellow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a distinctive, slightly recurved appearance. Eranthis pinnatifida is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
