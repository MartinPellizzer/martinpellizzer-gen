    "intro": "Eragrostis vulgaris subsp. minor, commonly known as lesser lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
