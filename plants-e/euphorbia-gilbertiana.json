    "intro": "Euphorbia gilbertiana, commonly known as Gilbert's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant."
