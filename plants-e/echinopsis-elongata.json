    "intro": "Echinopsis elongata, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its adaptations include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and deep roots to access groundwater. Echinopsis elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
