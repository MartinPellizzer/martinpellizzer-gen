    "intro": "Epidendrum bracteolatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Amazon, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in humid climates with high rainfall. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Epidendrum bracteolatum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
