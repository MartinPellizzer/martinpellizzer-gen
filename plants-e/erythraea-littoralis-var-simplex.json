    "intro": "Erythraea littoralis var. simplex, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a rare variant of the erythraea plant species. It is typically found in coastal regions where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it resilient in harsh maritime environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
