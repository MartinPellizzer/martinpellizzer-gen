    "intro": "Eriospermum lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sorrels. Its unique woolly texture helps reduce water loss in arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Eriospermum lanuginosum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem."
