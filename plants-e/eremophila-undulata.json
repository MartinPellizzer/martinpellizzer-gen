    "intro": "Eremophila undulata, commonly known as the undulating emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, wavy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in well-drained soils. Eremophila undulata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
