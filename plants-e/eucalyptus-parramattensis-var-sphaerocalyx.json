    "intro": "Eucalyptus parramattensis var. sphaerocalyx, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky sheets. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and attract a variety of pollinators. The tree produces woody capsules that contain aromatic, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
