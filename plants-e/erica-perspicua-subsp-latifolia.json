It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage consisting of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica perspicua subsp. latifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
