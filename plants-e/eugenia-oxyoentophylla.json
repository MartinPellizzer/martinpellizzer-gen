It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications."
