It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and forest edges. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Elymus kamoji is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
