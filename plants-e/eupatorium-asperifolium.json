It is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is often found in the understory of hardwood forests.
