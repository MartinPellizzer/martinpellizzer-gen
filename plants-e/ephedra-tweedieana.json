    "intro": "Ephedra tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family, native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
