    "intro": "Ectadium virgatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is typically found in temperate forests and is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species."
