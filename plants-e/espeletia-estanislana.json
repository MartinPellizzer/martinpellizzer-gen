    "intro": "Espeletia estanislana, commonly known as the Estanisl\u00e1n's heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Espeletia estanislana is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
