The plant typically grows in moist environments such as marshes and wetlands, and it is often found in regions with high humidity. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and have been used in traditional medicine. Eupatorium brasiliense plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
