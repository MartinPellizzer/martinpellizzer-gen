    "intro": "Eleusine intermedia, commonly known as false rice, is a tropical annual grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white spikelets that are often mistaken for rice. The plant produces numerous branches and has a fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and wet environments. It is often found in agricultural fields and along waterways, where it can become a weed. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important plant in ecological studies and agricultural research."
