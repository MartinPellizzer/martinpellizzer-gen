    "intro": "Erianthus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Erianthus flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
