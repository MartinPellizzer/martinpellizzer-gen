It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. Its fruits are adapted for explosive dispersal, a mechanism known as ballistic seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
