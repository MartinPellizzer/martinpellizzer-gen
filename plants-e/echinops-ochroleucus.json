    "intro": "Echinops ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a defining feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
