    "intro": "Eriotheca tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly eriotheca, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in panicles, and are typically white or pale yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
