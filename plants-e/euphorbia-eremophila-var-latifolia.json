    "intro": "Euphorbia eremophila var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are broad and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The leaves and stems contain toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
