    "intro": "Euphorbia leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it is considered a hardy and resilient plant for xerophytic gardens."
