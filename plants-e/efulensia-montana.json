    "intro": "Efulensia montana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem. Efulensia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
