    "intro": "Euphorbia filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
