    "intro": "Elatostema brevifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often obscured by the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Elatostema brevifolium is known for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to the ground cover in its natural habitat."
