    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis subsp. viminalis, commonly known as the river red gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a bright red inner layer, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its durability and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The species is also important in ecological contexts, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
