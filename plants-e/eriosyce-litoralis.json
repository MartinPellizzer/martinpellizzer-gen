    "intro": "Eriosyce litoralis, commonly known as the coastal eriosyce, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coast. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Eriosyce litoralis is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
