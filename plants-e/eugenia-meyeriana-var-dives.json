    "intro": "Eugenia meyeriana var. dives, commonly known as the Crimson Beauty hibiscus, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to pink, often with a white throat, and are typically 5-7 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, round, orange to red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy green surface and a slightly serrated edge."
