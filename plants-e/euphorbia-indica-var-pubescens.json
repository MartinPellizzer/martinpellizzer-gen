    "intro": "Euphorbia indica var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. However, it can be invasive in some areas and may cause skin irritation upon contact."
