    "intro": "Ehretia retusa, commonly known as the silverleaf ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Ehretia retusa is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
