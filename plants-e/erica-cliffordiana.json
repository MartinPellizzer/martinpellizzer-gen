    "intro": "Erica cliffordiana, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica cliffordiana is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
