    "intro": "Empodisma gracillimum, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Empodisma gracillimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
