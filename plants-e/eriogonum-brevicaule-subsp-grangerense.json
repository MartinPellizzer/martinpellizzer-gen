    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule subsp. grangerense, commonly known as the Granger's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in dry climates."
