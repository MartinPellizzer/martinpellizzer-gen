    "intro": "Eucalyptus resinifera var. kirtoniana, commonly known as the Kirton's malleable gum, is a variant of the malleable gum tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually dull green and have a slight aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its unique feature is the production of a sticky, resinous gum that exudes from the trunk and branches, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and heat."
