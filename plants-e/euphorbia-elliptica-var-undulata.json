    "intro": "Euphorbia elliptica var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy, wavy-edged leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique leaf shape and ability to store water make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
