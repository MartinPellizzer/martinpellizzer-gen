It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in disturbed soils and dry environments. Erodium oxyrhinchum is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
