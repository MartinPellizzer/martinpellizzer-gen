It features a low-growing, succulent structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid environments. Euphorbia exigua is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
