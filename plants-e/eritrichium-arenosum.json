    "intro": "Eritrichium arenosum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Eritrichium arenosum is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
