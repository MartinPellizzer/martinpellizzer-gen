It features a basal rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
