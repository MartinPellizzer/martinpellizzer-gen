    "intro": "Erigeron eatonii var. lavandulus, commonly known as lavender blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its blue to violet flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss."
