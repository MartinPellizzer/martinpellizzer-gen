    "intro": "Elsholtzia schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian germander, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions worldwide."
