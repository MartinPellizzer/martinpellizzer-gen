    "intro": "Eatonella congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's Eatonella, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and slopes. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eatonella congdonii is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
