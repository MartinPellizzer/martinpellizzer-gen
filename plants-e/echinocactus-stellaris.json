It is a slow-growing cactus characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Echinocactus stellaris is well adapted to arid environments and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth."
