It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are typically a pale blue or white in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is typical of the Apiaceae family. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
