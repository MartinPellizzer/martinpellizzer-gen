    "intro": "Euphorbia welwitschii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, green to blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powder. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
