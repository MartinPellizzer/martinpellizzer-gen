    "intro": "Elymus aleuticus, commonly known as Aleutian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northwestern United States and Alaska. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets that mature into a tan or brown color. Elymus aleuticus plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
