    "intro": "Eugenia flavescens var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved clove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to reddish-brown, clove-like buds. These buds are harvested and used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their aromatic properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and economic value."
