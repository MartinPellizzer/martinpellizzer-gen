    "intro": "Ephedra trifaria, commonly known as the three-branched ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Ephedra trifaria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils and along slopes. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to significant botanical and pharmacological interest."
