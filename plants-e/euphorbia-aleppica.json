    "intro": "Euphorbia aleppica, commonly known as the Aleppo spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a thick, branching stem with milky sap that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be covered in small spines. Euphorbia aleppica is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
