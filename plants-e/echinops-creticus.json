    "intro": "Echinops creticus, commonly known as the Cretan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops creticus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
