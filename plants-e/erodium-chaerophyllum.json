    "intro": "Erodium chaerophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seed pods split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread."
