    "intro": "Eupatorium tomentosum, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands and along streambanks, thriving in moist, rich soils. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its small, clustered white flowers bloom in the late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
