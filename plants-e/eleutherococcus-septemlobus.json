    "intro": "Eleutherococcus septemlobus, commonly known as the seven-lobed eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with seven leaflets, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its root system is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties. Eleutherococcus septemlobus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
