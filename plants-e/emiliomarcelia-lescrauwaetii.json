    "intro": "Emiliomarcelia lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the Lescrauwaet's emilia, is a rare flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with prominent central disc florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
