It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and produces blue or violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Evolvulus angustissimus is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
