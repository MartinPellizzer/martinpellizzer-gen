    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. nigridens, commonly known as blackstem field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often covered in a layer of soft, brownish spore cases. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in wet, marshy environments. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
