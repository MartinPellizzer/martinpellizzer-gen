    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to cold climates, helping to reduce water loss and protect against frost. The showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
