It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are often white or yellowish. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
