    "intro": "Eugenia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. Eugenia cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
