    "intro": "Euphorbia canuti, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. Euphorbia canuti is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
