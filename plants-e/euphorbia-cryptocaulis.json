    "intro": "Euphorbia cryptocaulis, commonly known as the cryptic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Euphorbia cryptocaulis is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
