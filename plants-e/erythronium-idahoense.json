    "intro": "Erythronium idahoense, commonly known as the Idaho trout lily, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, often reddish-brown marked leaves that persist through the winter. The plant produces a single, nodding flower with three bright yellow petals and a greenish throat, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded woodland habitats. The species is characterized by its early blooming habit and is often found in association with other spring ephemerals."
