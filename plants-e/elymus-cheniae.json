    "intro": "Elymus cheniae, commonly known as the Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to China and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the flowering structures typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Elymus cheniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
