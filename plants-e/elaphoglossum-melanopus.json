    "intro": "Elaphoglossum melanopus, commonly known as the black-stemmed harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum melanopus is characterized by its distinctive blackish stem and is often found in temperate regions of the Americas."
