    "intro": "Euthamia scabra, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Euthamia scabra is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
