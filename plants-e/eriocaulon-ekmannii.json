    "intro": "Eriocaulon ekmannii, commonly known as the Ekmann's spike-moss, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is adapted for water environments, allowing it to thrive in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Eriocaulon ekmannii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
