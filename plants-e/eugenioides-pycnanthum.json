    "intro": "Eugenioides pycnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. These flowers are followed by small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenioides pycnanthum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical and subtropical forests."
