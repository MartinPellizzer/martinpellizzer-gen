    "intro": "Elytrigia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Elytrigia arizonica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
