    "intro": "Eriosyce aspillagae subsp. maechlerorum, commonly known as the Maechler's rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
