    "intro": "Elymus glaucifolius var. robustus, commonly known as the robust bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
