    "intro": "Eriocaulon nipponicum f. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous spike-rush, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a dense spike of small, pale flowers. This fern-like plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a vulnerable or endangered species in its native range."
