    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius subsp. albanicus, commonly known as the Albanian grass-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
