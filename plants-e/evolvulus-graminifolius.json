    "intro": "Evolvulus graminifolius, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Americas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
