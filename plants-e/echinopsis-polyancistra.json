    "intro": "Echinopsis polyancistra, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange coloration, which is due to the presence of a different species grafted onto its base. The plant has a short, thick stem with spiny areoles and produces white or yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is a popular choice for container gardening due to its compact size and striking appearance. The plant requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
