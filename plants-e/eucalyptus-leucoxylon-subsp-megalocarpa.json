    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon subsp. megalocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are often broader than those of other eucalyptus species. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing small, black seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
