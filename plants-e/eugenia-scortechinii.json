    "intro": "Eugenia scortechinii, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Eugenia scortechinii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
