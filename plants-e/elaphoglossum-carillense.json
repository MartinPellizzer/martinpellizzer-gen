    "intro": "Elaphoglossum carillense, commonly known as the Carillense holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Elaphoglossum carillense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
