    "intro": "Ericoides protrudens, commonly known as the protruding heath, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ericoides protrudens is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
