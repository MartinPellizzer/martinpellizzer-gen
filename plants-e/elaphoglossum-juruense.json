    "intro": "Elaphoglossum juruense, commonly known as the Juruense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. Elaphoglossum juruense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
