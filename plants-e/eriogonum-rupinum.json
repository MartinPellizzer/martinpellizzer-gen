    "intro": "Eriogonum rupinum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum rupinum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native environment."
