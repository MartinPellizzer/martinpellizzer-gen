    "intro": "Euphorbia attastoma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia attastoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
