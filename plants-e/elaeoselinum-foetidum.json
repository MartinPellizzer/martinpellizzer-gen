    "intro": "Elaeoselinum foetidum, commonly known as stinking elaeoselinum, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, rocky soils. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced when the plant is crushed. Despite its pungent smell, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
