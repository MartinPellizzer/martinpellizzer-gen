It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Ebnerella bullardiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
