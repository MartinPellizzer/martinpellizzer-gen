    "intro": "Euphrasia jaubertiana proles boraei, commonly known as the Arctic eyebright, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent yellow spots, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive, slightly succulent texture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
