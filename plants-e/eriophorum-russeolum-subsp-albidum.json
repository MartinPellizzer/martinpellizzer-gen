    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum subsp. albidum, commonly known as the white cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow flowering heads, which are composed of numerous small, scale-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or heathland environments. Its leaves are grass-like, slender, and often covered with fine hairs. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates."
