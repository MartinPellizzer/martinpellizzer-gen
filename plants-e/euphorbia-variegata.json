    "intro": "Euphorbia variegata, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking, fleshy leaves with distinctive yellow and green variegation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a potted plant. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
