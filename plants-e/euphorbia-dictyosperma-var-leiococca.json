    "intro": "Euphorbia dictyosperma var. leiococca, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
