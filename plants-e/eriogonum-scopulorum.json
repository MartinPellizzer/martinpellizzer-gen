    "intro": "Eriogonum scopulorum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum scopulorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
