    "intro": "Erica finitima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Erica finitima thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It is an important component of fynbos vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
