    "intro": "Euphorbia guiengola, commonly known as the Guianese spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique type of flower known as a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
