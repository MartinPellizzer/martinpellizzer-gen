It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum auripilum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
