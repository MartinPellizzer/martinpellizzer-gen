It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that turn red when mature. Euodia crotonifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
