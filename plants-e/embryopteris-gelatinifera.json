    "intro": "Embryopteris gelatinifera, commonly known as the gelatinous fern, is a unique species characterized by its unusual botanical features. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is notable for its gelatinous, water-retaining structures on its fronds. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, delicate segments, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its ability to retain moisture makes it well adapted to humid environments. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
