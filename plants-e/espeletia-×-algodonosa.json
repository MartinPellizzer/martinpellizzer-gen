    "intro": "Espeletia \u00d7 algodonosa, commonly known as the woolly tree heath, is a hybrid plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its rosette-shaped growth pattern and showy inflorescences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species. Espeletia \u00d7 algodonosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various native wildlife."
