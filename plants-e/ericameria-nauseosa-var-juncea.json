It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowering heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
