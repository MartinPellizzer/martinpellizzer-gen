    "intro": "Elachothamnos, commonly known as the \"bushy thornbush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, thorny branches, and small, often clustered leaves. Elachothamnos species produce small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. These plants are adapted to dry conditions and play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
