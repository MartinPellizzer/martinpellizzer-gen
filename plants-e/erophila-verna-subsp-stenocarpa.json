It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated fruits compared to the typical form of Erophila verna."
