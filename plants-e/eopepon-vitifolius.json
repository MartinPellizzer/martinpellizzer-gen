    "intro": "Eopepon vitifolius, commonly known as the wine-leaf tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy appearance and a distinctively rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red fruits resembling small, round berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks."
