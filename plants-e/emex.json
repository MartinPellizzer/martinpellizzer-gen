    "intro": "Emex, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Emex species are annuals, completing their life cycle within a single growing season."
