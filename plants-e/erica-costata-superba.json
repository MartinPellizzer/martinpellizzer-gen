    "intro": "Erica costata superba, commonly known as the coastal heath or narrow-leaf heather, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Erica costata superba thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for local wildlife."
