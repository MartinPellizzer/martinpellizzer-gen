    "intro": "Elaphrium lonchophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaphrium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to regions of southern Africa, where it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
