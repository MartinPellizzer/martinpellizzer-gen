    "intro": "Espeletia soroca, commonly known as the \"soroca\" or \"snow mountain\" plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude, arid environment. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Espeletia soroca plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for local pollinators."
