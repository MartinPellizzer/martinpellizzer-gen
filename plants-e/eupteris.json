    "intro": "Eupteris, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Huperziaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect, branching stems and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Eupteris species have simple, elongated leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. They are non-vascular plants, meaning they lack true roots, stems, and leaves as found in vascular plants. Eupteris plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
