    "intro": "Encyclia fucata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are dark green and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Encyclia fucata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
