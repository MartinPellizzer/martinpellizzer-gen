    "intro": "Epilobium cephalostigma var. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with five petals, and bloom in late summer. The species is noted for its adaptability to wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
