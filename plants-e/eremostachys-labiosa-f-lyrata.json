    "intro": "Eremostachys labiosa f. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata form of the woolly eremostachys, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. This form is distinguished by its more elongated, lyrical leaf shape compared to the typical variety."
