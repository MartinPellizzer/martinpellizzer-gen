    "intro": "Euphorbia geminiloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often lobed or notched. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Euphorbia geminiloba is generally low-maintenance and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
