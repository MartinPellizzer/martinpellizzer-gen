    "intro": "Echinocactus leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fleshed cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, spiny structure helps it retain water in arid environments. The fleshy, white interior of its stems is a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name."
