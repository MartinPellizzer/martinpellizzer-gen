    "intro": "Euphorbia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a milky, toxic sap. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia uliginosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
