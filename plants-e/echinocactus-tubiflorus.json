    "intro": "Echinocactus tubiflorus, commonly known as the tuberose cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Echinocactus tubiflorus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
