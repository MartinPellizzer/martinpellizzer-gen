    "intro": "Eremophila lanata, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eremophila lanata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
