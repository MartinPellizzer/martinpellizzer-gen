    "intro": "Erythrococca patula, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. However, it is also known to host mealybugs, which can make it a potential pest in certain environments."
