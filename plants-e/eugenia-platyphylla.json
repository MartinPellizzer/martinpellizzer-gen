    "intro": "Eugenia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia platyphylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary uses."
