    "intro": "Eriachne triodioides, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, forming dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil. Eriachne triodioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
