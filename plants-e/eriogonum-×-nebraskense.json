It is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Eriogonum \u00d7 nebraskense plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small animals."
