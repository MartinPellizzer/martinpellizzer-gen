    "intro": "Erica copiosa var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, wiry stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the winter months. The plant is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal gardens with minimal maintenance."
