    "intro": "Erythrostemon calycinus, commonly known as the California fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has woody stems and is adapted to dry, sunny environments, making it a hardy species for arid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Erythrostemon calycinus is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
