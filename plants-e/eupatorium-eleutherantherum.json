    "intro": "Eupatorium eleutherantherum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and prairies. Eupatorium eleutherantherum is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
