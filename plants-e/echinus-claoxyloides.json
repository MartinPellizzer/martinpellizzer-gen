    "intro": "Echinus claoxyloides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
