    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrorrhiza, commonly known as the redroot spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It has a milky latex sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia erythrorrhiza is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
