    "intro": "Erysimum incanum var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow flowers with four petals. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
