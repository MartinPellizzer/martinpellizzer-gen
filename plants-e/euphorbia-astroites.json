    "intro": "Euphorbia astroites, commonly known as the star spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, spiny leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a unique, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia astroites is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
