    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
