    "intro": "Eupatorium innumerosum, commonly known as boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Boneset is often found in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its name derives from the brittle, bone-like stems that break easily."
