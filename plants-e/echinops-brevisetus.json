    "intro": "Echinops brevisetus, commonly known as the short-horned thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, white flowers that attract pollinators. Echinops brevisetus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
