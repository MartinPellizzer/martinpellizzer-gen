    "intro": "Erlangea moramballae, commonly known as the Moramballa orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea moramballae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
