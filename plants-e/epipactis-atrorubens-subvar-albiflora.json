    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens subvar. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and distinctive, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. The subvariety albiflora is distinguished by its notably white flowers, setting it apart from the more typical red or orange-flowered forms of the main species."
