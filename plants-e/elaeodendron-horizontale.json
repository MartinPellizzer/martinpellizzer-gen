    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elaeidodendron horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal elaeodendron, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its horizontally spreading growth habit, with branches that often lie flat on the ground. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets that are arranged in an alternating pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or green hues, and it produces woody fruits containing seeds. Due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
