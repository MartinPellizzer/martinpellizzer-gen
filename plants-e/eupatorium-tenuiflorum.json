    "intro": "Eupatorium tenuiflorum, commonly known as slenderflower boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its name derives from the Latin \"tenuis,\" meaning slender, referring to its delicate floral structure. Eupatorium tenuiflorum is often found in swampy areas and is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
