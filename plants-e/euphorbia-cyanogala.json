    "intro": "Euphorbia cyanogala, commonly known as the blue spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
