    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Elaphoglossum pilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
