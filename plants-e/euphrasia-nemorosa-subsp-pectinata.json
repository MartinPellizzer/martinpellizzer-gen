The plant produces numerous tiny flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Euphrasia nemorosa subsp. pectinata is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
