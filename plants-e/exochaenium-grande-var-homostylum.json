It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is noted for its resilience to drought and its role in supporting local insect populations."
