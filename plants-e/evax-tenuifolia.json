    "intro": "Evax tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf evax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its small, hairy stems and clustered inflorescences make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
