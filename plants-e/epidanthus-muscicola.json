    "intro": "Epidanthus muscicola, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that often resemble moss. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique, spurred lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
