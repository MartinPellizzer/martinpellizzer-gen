    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 mohilewiensis, commonly known as the Mohilev hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis palustris. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive dark red or purple lip. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows across Eastern Europe. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
