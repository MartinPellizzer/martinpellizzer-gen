    "intro": "Euphorbia kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakorum spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, adapted to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Euphorbia kaschgarica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
