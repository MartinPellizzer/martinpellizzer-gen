    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale rush or slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, typical of its classification as a fern ally. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plants on Earth."
