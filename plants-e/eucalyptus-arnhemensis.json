    "intro": "Eucalyptus arnhemensis, commonly known as the Arnhemland ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the northern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along river systems."
