    "intro": "Elaphoglossum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
