    "intro": "Excoecaria oppositifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it a key species in coastal mangrove ecosystems. Its unique adaptations allow it to flourish in areas with high salinity and low oxygen levels."
