    "intro": "Elaphoglossum heterostipes, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or reflexed. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum heterostipes is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
