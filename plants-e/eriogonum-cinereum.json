    "intro": "Eriogonum cinereum, commonly known as the grayleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit with upright stems and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Eriogonum cinereum is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native range."
