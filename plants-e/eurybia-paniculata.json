    "intro": "Eurybia paniculata, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white or pale blue ray flowers, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in sandy or saline soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Eurybia paniculata is typically found in maritime climates and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
