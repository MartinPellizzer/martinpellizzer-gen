    "intro": "Echinocactus denudatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
