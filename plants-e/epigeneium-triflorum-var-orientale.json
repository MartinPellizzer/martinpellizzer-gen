    "intro": "Epigeneium triflorum var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental three-flowered epigeneium, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the moist, shaded environments it inhabits. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
