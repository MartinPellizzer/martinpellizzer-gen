    "intro": "Epidendrum paradisicola, commonly known as the paradise orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers that are typically pink or red with contrasting yellow markings. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum paradisicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
