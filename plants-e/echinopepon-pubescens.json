    "intro": "Echinopepon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bitter gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, pubescent stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves. The fruit is typically oblong, with a rough, warty surface and a bitter taste, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This plant is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it is less common in commercial agriculture compared to other cucurbits."
