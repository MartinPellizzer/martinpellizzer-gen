    "intro": "Eucalyptus yangoura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia, specifically found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub form and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Eucalyptus yangoura produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
