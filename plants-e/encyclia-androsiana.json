    "intro": "Encyclia androsiana, commonly known as the Andros Island orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Andros Island in the Bahamas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, rhizomatous growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces racemes of small, fragrant, white to pale green flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
