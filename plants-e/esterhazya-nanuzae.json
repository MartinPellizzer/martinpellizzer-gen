    "intro": "Esterhazya nanuzae, commonly known as the Hungarian marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Hungary and Romania. It thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it relies on moist, nutrient-rich soil for growth. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other specialized wetland flora. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Esterhazya nanuzae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
