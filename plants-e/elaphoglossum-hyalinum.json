    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hyalinum, commonly known as the translucent holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy, translucent cuticle. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive silvery sheen that gives the plant its common name."
