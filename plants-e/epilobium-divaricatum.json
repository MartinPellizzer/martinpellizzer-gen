    "intro": "Epilobium divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping willow or silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or reddish, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium divaricatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in meadows."
