    "intro": "Echinopogon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, bristly leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that often bloom in shades of blue or purple. Echinopogon species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline or well-drained environments. They are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The genus includes several species, such as Echinopogon tetraphyllus, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
