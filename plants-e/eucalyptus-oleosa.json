    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal areas of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Eucalyptus oleosa produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, particularly cineole, make it valuable for both aromatic and medicinal purposes."
