It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple spikelets that nod towards the ground, giving it its common name. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. This variety is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas."
