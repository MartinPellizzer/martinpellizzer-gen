    "intro": "Ericoides leucodesmium, commonly known as the white toothed bolete, is a fungal species belonging to the Boletaceae family. It is characterized by its pale, often white to pale yellow cap and a thick, fibrous stem that is typically lighter in color. The pores of this fungus are small and yellow, turning reddish-brown with age, which is a distinguishing feature. It grows in association with coniferous trees, particularly in temperate forest ecosystems. The spore release is facilitated by the development of a distinctive, sticky layer on the underside of the cap."
