It features basal and sometimes spreading leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
