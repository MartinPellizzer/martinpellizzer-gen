    "intro": "Epidendrum radicans, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body that grows along the forest floor. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Epidendrum radicans reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its simple yet efficient structure allows it to absorb water and nutrients directly from the environment."
