    "intro": "Eulophia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that protects the reproductive parts. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Eulophia cucullata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
