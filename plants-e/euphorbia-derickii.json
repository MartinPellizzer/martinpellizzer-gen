    "intro": "Euphorbia derickii, commonly known as the Derick's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia derickii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
