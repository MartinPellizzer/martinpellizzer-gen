    "intro": "Ericoides adenophorum, commonly known as the clustered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ericoides adenophorum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
