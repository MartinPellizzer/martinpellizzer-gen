    "intro": "Eryngium elegans var. genuinum, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to violet spiky flower heads that resemble thistles, surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
