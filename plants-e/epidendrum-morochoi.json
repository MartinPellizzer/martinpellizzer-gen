    "intro": "Epidendrum morochoi, commonly known as the Morochoi Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically features narrow, strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum morochoi is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
