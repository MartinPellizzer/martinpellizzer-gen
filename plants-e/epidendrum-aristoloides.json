    "intro": "Epidendrum aristoloides, commonly known as the aristoloid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Epidendrum aristoloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
