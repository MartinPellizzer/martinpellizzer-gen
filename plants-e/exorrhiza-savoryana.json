    "intro": "Exorrhiza savoryana, commonly known as the desert savory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes junipers and cedars, and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Exorrhiza savoryana is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
