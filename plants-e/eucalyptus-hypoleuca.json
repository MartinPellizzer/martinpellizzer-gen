    "intro": "Eucalyptus hypoleuca, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green color with a rough texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. The tree is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
