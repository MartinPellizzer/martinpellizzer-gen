    "intro": "Eleutherospermum cicutarium, commonly known as the water smartweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize muddy soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Eleutherospermum cicutarium is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, from still ponds to flowing streams."
