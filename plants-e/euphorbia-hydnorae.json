    "intro": "Euphorbia hydnorae, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a unique and striking plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a corpse, hence its common name. The plant is a succulent, adapted to thrive in arid environments with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies, which are attracted by its strong, decaying odor. Euphorbia hydnorae is also notable for its lack of leaves, relying solely on its stem for photosynthesis."
