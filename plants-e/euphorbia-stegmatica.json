    "intro": "Euphorbia stegmatica, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia stegmatica is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
