    "intro": "Eurybia tenuifolia var. bathurstiana, commonly known as Bathurst's brittleweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
