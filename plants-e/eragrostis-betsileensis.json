    "intro": "Eragrostis betsileensis, commonly known as the Betsileo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned florets. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, adapting well to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Eragrostis betsileensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
