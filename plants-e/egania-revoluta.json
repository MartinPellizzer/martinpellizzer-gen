    "intro": "Egania revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Egania revoluta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
