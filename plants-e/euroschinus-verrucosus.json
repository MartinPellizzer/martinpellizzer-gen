    "intro": "Euroschinus verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems covered in a rough, bark-like layer, which provides protection against herbivores and environmental stress. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Euroschinus verrucosus is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
