It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
