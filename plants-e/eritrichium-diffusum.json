    "intro": "Eritrichium diffusum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces delicate, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowers are visited by a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species in ecological habitats. Eritrichium diffusum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
