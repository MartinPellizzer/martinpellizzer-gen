It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and red, edible berries. The plant has simple, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed."
