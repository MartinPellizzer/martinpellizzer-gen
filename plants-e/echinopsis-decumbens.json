    "intro": "Echinopsis decumbens, commonly known as the \"Lying Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that lie close to the ground, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in soft, spiny areoles, and it is adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. Echinopsis decumbens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
