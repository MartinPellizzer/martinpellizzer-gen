    "intro": "Eryngium marginatum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eryngium marginatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal or sandy soils."
