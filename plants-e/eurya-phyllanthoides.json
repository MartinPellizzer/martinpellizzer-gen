It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a source of nectar for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Eurya phyllanthoides is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
