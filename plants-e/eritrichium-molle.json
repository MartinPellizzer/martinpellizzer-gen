    "intro": "Eritrichium molle, commonly known as the soft eritrichium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features basal leaves that are soft and woolly to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Eritrichium molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
