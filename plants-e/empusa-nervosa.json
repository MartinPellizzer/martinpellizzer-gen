    "intro": "Empusa nervosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that anchor it to its host and absorb water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and are borne in clusters, while its berries are red and contain toxic compounds. Empusa nervosa is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitats."
