    "intro": "Eleutherostemon oliganthus, commonly known as the slender-flowered eleutherostemon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy, often tubular flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, pale flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
