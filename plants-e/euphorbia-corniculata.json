    "intro": "Euphorbia corniculata, commonly known as the horned puffball, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like structures that emerge from a basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia corniculata is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, aiding in its survival in dry conditions."
