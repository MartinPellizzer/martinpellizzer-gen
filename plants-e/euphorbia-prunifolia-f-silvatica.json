    "intro": "Euphorbia prunifolia f. silvatica, commonly known as the forest euphorbia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish tinge, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
