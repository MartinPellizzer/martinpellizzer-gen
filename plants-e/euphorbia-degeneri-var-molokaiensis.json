    "intro": "Euphorbia degeneri var. molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
