    "intro": "Euphorbia scandens, commonly known as the climbing spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, stem-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has a branching habit and can grow quite long, often climbing or trailing along surfaces. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
