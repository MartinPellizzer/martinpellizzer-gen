    "intro": "Euphorbia porcata, commonly known as the \"pork plant,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, spiky leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
