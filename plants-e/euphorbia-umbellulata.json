    "intro": "Euphorbia umbellulata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbia umbellulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
