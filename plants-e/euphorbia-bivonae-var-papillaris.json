It features a branched stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a unique, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, requiring caution when handling the plant."
