    "intro": "Erythroxylum magnoliifolium, commonly known as the magnolia-leaved erythroxylum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of magnolia trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It is part of the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is not related to the coca plant, despite its name, and is not used for producing stimulants."
