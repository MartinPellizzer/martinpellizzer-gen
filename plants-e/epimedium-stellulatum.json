    "intro": "Epimedium stellulatum, commonly known as the star-leaved barberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It features compound leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and early blooming habit."
