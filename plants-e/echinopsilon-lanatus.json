    "intro": "Echinopsilon lanatus, commonly known as the hairy echinops, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruiting bodies that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Echinopsilon lanatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental spiny fruit."
