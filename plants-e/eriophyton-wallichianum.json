It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles threads, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
