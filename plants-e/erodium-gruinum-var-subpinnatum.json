It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. Its small, pink or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
