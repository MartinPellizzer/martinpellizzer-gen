    "intro": "Euphorbia characias, commonly known as the Cornish spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its tolerance for poor soils and salt spray. Euphorbia characias is also noted for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in full sun."
