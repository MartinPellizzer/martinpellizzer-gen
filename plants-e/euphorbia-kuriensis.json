    "intro": "Euphorbia kuriensis, commonly known as the Kuriensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Euphorbia kuriensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
