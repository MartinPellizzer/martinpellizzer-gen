    "intro": "Erythrocephalum foliosum, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erythrocephalum foliosum is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient species in coastal environments."
