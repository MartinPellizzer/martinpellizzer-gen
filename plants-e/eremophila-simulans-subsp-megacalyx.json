    "intro": "Eremophila simulans subsp. megacalyx, commonly known as the large calyx emu bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces distinctive, large, fleshy calyces that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
