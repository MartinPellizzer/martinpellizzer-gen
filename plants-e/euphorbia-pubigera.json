    "intro": "Euphorbia pubigera, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia pubigera is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
