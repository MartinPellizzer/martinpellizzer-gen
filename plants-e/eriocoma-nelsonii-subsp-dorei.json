    "intro": "Eriocoma nelsonii subsp. dorei, commonly known as the Dore's eriocoma, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyons. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by small, cylindrical seed heads."
