    "intro": "Elaeophora, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its deciduous, compound leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces legumes as its fruit. Elaeophora species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, savannah-like habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
