    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. polystachion, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
