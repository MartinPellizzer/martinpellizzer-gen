    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
