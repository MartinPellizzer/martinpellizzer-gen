    "intro": "Epilobium rubescens, commonly known as redstem willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and riverbanks. The plant features slender, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epilobium rubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
