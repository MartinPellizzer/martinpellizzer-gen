    "intro": "Erodium bipinnatum var. albiflorum, commonly known as white-flowered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided into fine, thread-like segments, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in rocky areas."
