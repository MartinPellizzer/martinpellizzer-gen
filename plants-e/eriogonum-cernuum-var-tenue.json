    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum var. tenue, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale green, hairy stems and small, clustered white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
