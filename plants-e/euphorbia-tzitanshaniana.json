    "intro": "Euphorbia tzitanshaniana, commonly known as the Tzitan Shan spurge, is a rare and striking plant native to China. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and striking, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces unique, cup-shaped structures called cyathia, which contain small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
