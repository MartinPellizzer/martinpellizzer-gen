    "intro": "Euphorbia ingallsii, commonly known as the ghostplant, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia ingallsii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
