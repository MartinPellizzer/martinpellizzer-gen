It typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite or whorled leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. Its flowers are small, pinkish to reddish, and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Epilobium verticillatum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic environments."
