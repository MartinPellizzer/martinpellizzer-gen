    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 tesquicola, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile, diploid hybrid species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia bulbosa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often green to bluish-green in color. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle with spikelets that are usually two-ranked. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
