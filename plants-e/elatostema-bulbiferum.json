    "intro": "Elatostema bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and the presence of bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators. Elatostema bulbiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid conditions."
