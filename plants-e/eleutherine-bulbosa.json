It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that resembles an elephant's foot, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a reddish or purple tinge. Eleutherine bulbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
