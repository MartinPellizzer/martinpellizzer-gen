    "intro": "Eupatorium confluentis, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color.
