    "intro": "Eryngium racemosum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by silver-green bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often growing in coastal or rocky areas. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eryngium racemosum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant nature."
