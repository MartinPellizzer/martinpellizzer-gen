    "intro": "Eukylista spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's eukylista, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically exhibits compact growth with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Eukylista spruceana is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
