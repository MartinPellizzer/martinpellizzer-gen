    "intro": "Eulophia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and features slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the damp soil. Eulophia pratensis is a relatively rare species, often found in specific habitats with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil."
