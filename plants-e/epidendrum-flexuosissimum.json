    "intro": "Epidendrum flexuosissimum, commonly known as the flexible epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support for the hanging inflorescences. This orchid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
