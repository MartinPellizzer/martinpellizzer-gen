    "intro": "Eragrostis rubens f. linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, linear leaves and dense growth habit. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its foliage is generally blue-green in color, which gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense turf in suitable conditions."
