    "intro": "Euphorbia vahlii, commonly known as the Vahli's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a caudex, which is a thick, rounded stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia vahlii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
