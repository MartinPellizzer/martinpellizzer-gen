    "intro": "Eriocarpum rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-haired everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, reddish-brown hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions. Eriocarpum rubiginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
