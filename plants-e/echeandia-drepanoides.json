    "intro": "Echeandia drepanoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Echeandia drepanoides is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus."
