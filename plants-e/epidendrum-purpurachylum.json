    "intro": "Epidendrum purpurachylum, commonly known as the Purple-Flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture to help retain moisture. Epidendrum purpurachylum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
