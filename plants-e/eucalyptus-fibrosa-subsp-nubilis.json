    "intro": "Eucalyptus fibrosa subsp. nubilis, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a greyish-green hue and a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale yellow to cream in color. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
