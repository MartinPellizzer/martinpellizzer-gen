    "intro": "Eremostachys laciniata subsp. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-leaved eryngo, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and narrow, lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
