    "intro": "Ericoides exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowers are tiny, bell-shaped, and typically pink or reddish, appearing in clusters during the spring. Ericoides exiguum is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value."
