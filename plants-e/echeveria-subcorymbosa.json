It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
