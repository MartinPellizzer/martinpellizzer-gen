    "intro": "Elephantopus cervinus, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the dandelion, though it is not closely related. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
