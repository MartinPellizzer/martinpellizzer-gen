    "intro": "Eriocoma occidentalis, commonly known as the western eriocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features wiry, branching stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pink or white and appear in late spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine hairs."
