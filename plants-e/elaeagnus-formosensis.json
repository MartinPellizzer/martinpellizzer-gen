It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
