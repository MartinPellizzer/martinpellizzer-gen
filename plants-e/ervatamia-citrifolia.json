    "intro": "Ervatamia citrifolia, commonly known as the citron tree, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble citrus fruits, though they are not true citrus. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
