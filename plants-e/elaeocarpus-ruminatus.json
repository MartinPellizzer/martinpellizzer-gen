    "intro": "Elaeocarpus ruminatus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine texture and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in several countries."
