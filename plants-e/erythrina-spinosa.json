    "intro": "Erythrina spinosa, commonly known as the flame tree or red torchwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often thorny, providing a natural defense mechanism. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Erythrina spinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
