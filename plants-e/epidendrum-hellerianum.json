It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Epidendrum hellerianum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
