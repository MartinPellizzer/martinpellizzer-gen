    "intro": "Epidendrum chrysostomum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking golden-yellow petals and sepals that are often adorned with red or orange markings, making it visually distinctive. The plant produces pendulous racemes of fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of its epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
