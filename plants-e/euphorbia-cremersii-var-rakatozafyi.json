    "intro": "Euphorbia cremersii var. rakatozafyi, commonly known as the Rakatozafy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
