    "intro": "Epipactis rubra, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats, often in shaded areas with moist, humus-rich soil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its flowers are showy, with a dark red or purple lip and yellow-green sepals and petals. Epipactis rubra is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive, albeit short-lived, blooms."
