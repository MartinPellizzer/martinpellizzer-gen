    "intro": "Eriochloa hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, grass-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, hair-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Eriochloa hackelii is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
