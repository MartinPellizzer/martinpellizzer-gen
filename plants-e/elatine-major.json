    "intro": "Elatine major, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has tiny, delicate leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white. Elatine major is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
