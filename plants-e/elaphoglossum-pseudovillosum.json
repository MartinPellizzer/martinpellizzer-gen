    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pseudovillosum, commonly known as the hairy false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. Elaphoglossum pseudovillosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
