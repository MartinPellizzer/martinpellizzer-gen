    "intro": "Exolepta calyculata, commonly known as the bluebell orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its natural habitat. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal."
