    "intro": "Euphorbia malacitana, commonly known as the Malaga spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant."
