    "intro": "Eugenia eperforata, commonly known as the perforate eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with distinctive perforations along the edges. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink and appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a reddish color and is edible, though not widely cultivated for commercial use."
