    "intro": "Euphorbia repanda, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Euphorbia repanda is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
