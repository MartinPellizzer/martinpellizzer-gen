    "intro": "Endiandra neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian endiandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and related plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
