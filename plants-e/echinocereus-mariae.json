    "intro": "Echinocereus mariae, commonly known as the Marie's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens and rockeries."
