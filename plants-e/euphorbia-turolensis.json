    "intro": "Euphorbia turolensis, commonly known as the Turol Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
