It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
