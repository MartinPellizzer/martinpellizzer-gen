    "intro": "Eucalyptus retusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves and flowers contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
