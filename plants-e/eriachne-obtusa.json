    "intro": "Eriachne obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Eriachne obtusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
