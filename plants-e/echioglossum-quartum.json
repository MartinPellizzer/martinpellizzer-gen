    "intro": "Echioglossum quartum, commonly known as the four-leaf echio, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
