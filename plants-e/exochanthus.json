    "intro": "Exochanthus, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Australia and New Guinea. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers. The fruits, which are typically fig-like, are edible and often used in local cuisines. Exochanthus species are adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments, making them resilient to harsh conditions."
