    "intro": "Euphorbia weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features succulent, branching stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of yellow or red. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight bluish tint, and they are arranged oppositely along the stems. Euphorbia weberbaueri is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
