It features opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in the spring, followed by bright blue berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes."
