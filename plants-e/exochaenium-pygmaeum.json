    "intro": "Exochaenium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small stature and dense growth habit make it an important component of desert vegetation. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
