    "intro": "Epidendrum virens, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and numerous, small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its foliage is often dark green with a waxy texture, adding to its ornamental appeal."
