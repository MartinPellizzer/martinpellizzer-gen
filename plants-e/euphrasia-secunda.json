    "intro": "Euphrasia secunda, commonly known as the lesser eyebright, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent yellow markings, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their distinctive \"eyebrow\" shape, giving rise to its common name. Euphrasia secunda is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and moist soils, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
