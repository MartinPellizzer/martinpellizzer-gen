    "intro": "Euphorbia finlaysonii, commonly known as the Finlayson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Euphorbia finlaysonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
