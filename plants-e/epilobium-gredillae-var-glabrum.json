    "intro": "Epilobium gredillae var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
