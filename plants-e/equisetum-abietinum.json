    "intro": "Equisetum abietinum, commonly known as the noble clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that resembles a club. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with fertile stems producing spore-bearing cones. Equisetum abietinum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
