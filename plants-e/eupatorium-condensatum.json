    "intro": "Eupatorium condensatum, commonly known as clustered boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. It serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
