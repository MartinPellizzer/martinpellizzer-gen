    "intro": "Erythranthe michiganensis, commonly known as Michigan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and open fields. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
