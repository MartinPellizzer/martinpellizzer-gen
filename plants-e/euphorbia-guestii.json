    "intro": "Euphorbia guestii, commonly known as the Blue Glow euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features striking blue-gray foliage with a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
