    "intro": "Eucalyptus obesa, commonly known as the fat eucalyptus, is a distinctive species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, contributing to its unique appearance. Eucalyptus obesa is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
