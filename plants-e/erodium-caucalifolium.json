    "intro": "Erodium caucalifolium, commonly known as the California morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant violet or blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
