    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water availability."
