    "intro": "Erica piluliformis, commonly known as the dwarf heath or miniature heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its profusion of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, hardy plants. Erica piluliformis is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
