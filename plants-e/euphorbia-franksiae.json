    "intro": "Euphorbia franksiae, commonly known as the Frank's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
