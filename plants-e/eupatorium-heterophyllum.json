    "intro": "Eupatorium heterophyllum, commonly known as the white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium heterophyllum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
