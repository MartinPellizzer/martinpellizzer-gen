    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those found in bogs and tundra environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Eriophorum angustifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
