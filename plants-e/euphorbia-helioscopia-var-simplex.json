    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia var. simplex, commonly known as the common spurge or sun spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 surrounded by reddish bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant has smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are alternate and broadly ovate. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. The latex it produces is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
