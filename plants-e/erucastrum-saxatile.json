    "intro": "Erucastrum saxatile, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Erucastrum saxatile is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
