    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The variety glauca is distinguished by its distinctive bluish hue, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves."
