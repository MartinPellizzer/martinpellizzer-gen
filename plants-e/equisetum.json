    "intro": "Equisetum, commonly known as horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Horsetails are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their stems can grow rapidly, sometimes reaching several meters in height. The plant contains high levels of silica, which gives it a distinctive abrasive texture and has historically been used in various practical applications."
