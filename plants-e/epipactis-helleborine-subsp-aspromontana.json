    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. aspromontana, commonly known as the aspromontan helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, wrinkled lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found on limestone or calcareous soils. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
