    "intro": "Eugenia pluricymosa, commonly known as the many-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that have numerous small, closely spaced lateral veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round, red or purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
