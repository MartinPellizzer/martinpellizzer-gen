    "intro": "Euphorbia pekinensis var. lasiocaula, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
