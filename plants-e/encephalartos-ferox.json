    "intro": "Encephalartos ferox, commonly known as the Cape ferox, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
