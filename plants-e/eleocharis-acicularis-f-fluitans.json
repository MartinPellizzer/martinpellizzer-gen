    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating spike-rush, is a variant of the spike-rush genus Eleocharis. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that grow in dense clusters. This floating form is adapted to aquatic environments, with its stems and leaves often remaining buoyant on the water's surface. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. It is often found in wetlands, ponds, and other shallow water habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
