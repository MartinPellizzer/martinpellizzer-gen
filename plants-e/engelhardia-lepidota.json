    "intro": "Engelhardia lepidota, commonly known as the satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its bark is smooth and often has a satin-like sheen, giving it its common name. Engelhardia lepidota is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
