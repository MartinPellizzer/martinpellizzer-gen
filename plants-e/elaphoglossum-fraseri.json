    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum fraseri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare fern in its native habitat."
