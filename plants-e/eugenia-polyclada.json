It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and pale in color. Eugenia polyclada is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
