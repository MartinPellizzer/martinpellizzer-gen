    "intro": "Elymus durus, commonly known as tough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense panicles, with awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. Elymus durus is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its robust nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species."
