    "intro": "Eragrostis mexicana var. pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf Mexican lovegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to reddish in color. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
