    "intro": "Elytropappus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are often hairy, giving it the common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by feathery seeds. Elytropappus hispidus is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
