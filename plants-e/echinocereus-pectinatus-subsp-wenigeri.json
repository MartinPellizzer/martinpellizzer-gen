    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus subsp. wenigeri, commonly known as the lesser prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, shrub-like plant with a dense covering of spines and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible, pear-shaped fruits known as tunas. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to desert gardens."
