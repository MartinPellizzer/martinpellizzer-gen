    "intro": "Eritrichium nanum var. chamissonis, commonly known as Chamisson's dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically features small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
