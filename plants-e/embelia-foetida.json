    "intro": "Embelia foetida, commonly known as the stinking root or Indian embelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, containing compounds with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's strong, unpleasant odor is a characteristic feature, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"stinking root.\""
