    "intro": "Echinopus, commonly known as the \"cotton bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and showy, often pink or white flowers. They are native to southern Africa and are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Echinopus species are succulent plants, storing water in their thick, fleshy leaves. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
