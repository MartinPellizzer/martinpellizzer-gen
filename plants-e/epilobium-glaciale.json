    "intro": "Epilobium glaciale, commonly known as glacier willow or snow willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Epilobium glaciale is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a food source for certain pollinators."
