    "intro": "Eugenia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but have a unique, slightly acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils near coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
