    "intro": "Eriochloa peruviana, commonly known as Peruvian panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
