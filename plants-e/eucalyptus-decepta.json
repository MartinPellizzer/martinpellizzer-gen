    "intro": "Eucalyptus decepta, commonly known as the red box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color beneath, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical flower buds that range in color from yellow to orange, which open to reveal white or cream flowers. Eucalyptus decepta is often found in open forests and woodlands, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
