    "intro": "Epilobium fastigiatum subsp. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies glaberrimum is distinguished by its nearly hairless stems and leaves, giving it a more streamlined appearance compared to other members of the species."
