    "intro": "Eleusine pilosa, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eleusine pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
