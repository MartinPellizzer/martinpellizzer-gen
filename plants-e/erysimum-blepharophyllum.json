    "intro": "Erysimum blepharophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine Wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and rocky substrates."
