It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its stiff, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
