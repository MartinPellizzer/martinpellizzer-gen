    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 aggregatum subsp. minus, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows, streambanks, and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to reddish-purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
