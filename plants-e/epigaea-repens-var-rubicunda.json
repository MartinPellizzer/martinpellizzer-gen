    "intro": "Epigaea repens var. rubicunda, commonly known as the red trailing arum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and produces small, fragrant, red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The showy red bracts surrounding the true flowers contribute to its ornamental value in gardens."
