    "intro": "Equisetum limosum f. leptocladon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This variety is distinguished by its slender, more delicate stems compared to other forms of Equisetum limosum."
