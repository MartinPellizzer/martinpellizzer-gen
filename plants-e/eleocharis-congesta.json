    "intro": "Eleocharis congesta, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetlands. The flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikelets."
