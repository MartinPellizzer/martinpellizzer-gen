    "intro": "Euphorbia costeana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia costeana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid landscapes."
