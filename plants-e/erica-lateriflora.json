    "intro": "Erica lateriflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from autumn to spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Erica lateriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
