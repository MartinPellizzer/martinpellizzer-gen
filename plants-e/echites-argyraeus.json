    "intro": "Echites argyraeus, commonly known as the silverleaf poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its vibrant red, pink, or white bracts that surround small, inconspicuous true flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, giving the plant its common name."
