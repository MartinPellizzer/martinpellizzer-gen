    "intro": "Echinocereus adustus subsp. adustus, commonly known as the Apache cliff prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits that are typically red or orange in color. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
