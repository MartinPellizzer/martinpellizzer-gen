    "intro": "Echeandia pseudopetiolata, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. Its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
