    "intro": "Elymus drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or alpine habitats, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus drobovii plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for certain grazing animals."
