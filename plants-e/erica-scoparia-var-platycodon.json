    "intro": "Erica scoparia var. platycodon, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form, which helps it thrive in rocky and sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal and maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
