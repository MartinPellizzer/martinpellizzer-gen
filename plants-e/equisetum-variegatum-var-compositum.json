    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. compositum, commonly known as the variegated horse tail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves and a central stem that is segmented and often has a distinct ridged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. This variety is noted for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
