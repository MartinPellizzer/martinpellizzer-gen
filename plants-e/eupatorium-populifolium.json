    "intro": "Eupatorium populifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and moist woodlands, thriving in humid environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Eupatorium populifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
