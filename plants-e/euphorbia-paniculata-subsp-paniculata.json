    "intro": "Euphorbia paniculata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly toothed margin. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woods and disturbed sites."
