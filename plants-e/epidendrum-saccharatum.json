    "intro": "Epidendrum saccharatum, commonly known as the sugar cane orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum saccharatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
