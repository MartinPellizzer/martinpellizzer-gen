    "intro": "Euphorbia cornastra, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with a branching structure that resembles a tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia cornastra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
