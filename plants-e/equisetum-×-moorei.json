    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 moorei, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale, characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential."
