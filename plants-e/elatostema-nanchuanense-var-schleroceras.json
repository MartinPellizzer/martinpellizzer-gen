    "intro": "Elatostema nanchuanense var. schleroceras, commonly known as the rock elatostema, is a rare variant of the Elatostema genus native to China. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high elevation. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
