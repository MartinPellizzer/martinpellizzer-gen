    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. altaicum, commonly known as bog willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in short, glandular hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are usually pink to red in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance in wetland environments."
