    "intro": "Equilabium viphyense subsp. viphyense, commonly known as the Viphyen orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
