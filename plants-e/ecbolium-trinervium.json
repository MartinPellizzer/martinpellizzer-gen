    "intro": "Ecbolium trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined ecbolium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in its native range."
