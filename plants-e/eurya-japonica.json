    "intro": "Eurya japonica, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting this species."
