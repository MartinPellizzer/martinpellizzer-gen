    "intro": "Epidendrum carlos-uribei, commonly known as the Carlos Uribei orchid, is a species native to Mexico, specifically the state of Chiapas. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that are highly ornamental. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining potting media. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
