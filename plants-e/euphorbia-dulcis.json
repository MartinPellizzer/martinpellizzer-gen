    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis, commonly known as sweet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. Its sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
