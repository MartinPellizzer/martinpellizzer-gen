    "intro": "Erica australis var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions."
