It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its leafy structure. The plant produces striking, elongated flowers with dark green sepals and petals, often with contrasting yellow markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
