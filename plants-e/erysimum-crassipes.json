    "intro": "Erysimum crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf wallflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Erysimum crassipes is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
