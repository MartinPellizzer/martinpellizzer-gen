    "intro": "Eleocharis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan province, where it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, triangular leaves. It produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
