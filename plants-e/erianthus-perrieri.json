The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, silver-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is increasingly cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
