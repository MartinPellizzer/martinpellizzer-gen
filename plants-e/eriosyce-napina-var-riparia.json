    "intro": "Eriosyce napina var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often near water sources such as rivers or streams. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing at the ends of the stems. This variety is adapted to tolerate drought conditions while still requiring some level of moisture in its habitat."
