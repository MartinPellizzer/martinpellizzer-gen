It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and buckwheat. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eriogonum panguicense is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
