    "intro": "Eucalyptus tindaliae, commonly known as the Tindaliae eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often pale or greyish bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. The plant is noted for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and for their potential medicinal properties."
