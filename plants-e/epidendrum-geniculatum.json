    "intro": "Epidendrum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orchid flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a distinctive zigzagging growth pattern, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral, providing structural support for its climbing habit. Epidendrum geniculatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
