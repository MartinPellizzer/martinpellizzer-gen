    "intro": "Euphorbia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia geniculata is often found in rocky soils and desert environments, thriving in full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
