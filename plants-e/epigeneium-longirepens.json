    "intro": "Epigeneium longirepens, commonly known as the long-stemmed epigeneium, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
