    "intro": "Epipactis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a striking, hooded flower with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent to attract pollinators, though it does not produce nectar. Epipactis decipiens is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
