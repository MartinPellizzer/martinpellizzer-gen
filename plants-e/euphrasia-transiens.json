    "intro": "Euphrasia transiens, commonly known as the transient eyebright, is a delicate annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its flowers are characterized by their prominent, showy eyespots, which are believed to deter herbivores. Euphrasia transiens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks."
