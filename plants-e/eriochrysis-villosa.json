    "intro": "Eriochrysis villosa, commonly known as the hairy leathery grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often concealed within the foliage, making it less conspicuous. Eriochrysis villosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
