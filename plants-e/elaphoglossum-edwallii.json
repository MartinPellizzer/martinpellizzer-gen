    "intro": "Elaphoglossum edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum edwallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
