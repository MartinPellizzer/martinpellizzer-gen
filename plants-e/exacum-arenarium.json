    "intro": "Exacum arenarium, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
