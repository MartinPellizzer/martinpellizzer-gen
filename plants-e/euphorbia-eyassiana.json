    "intro": "Euphorbia eyassiana, commonly known as the Eyassian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens."
