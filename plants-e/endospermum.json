    "intro": "Endospermum, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, pale grey bark and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, and the endosperm within the seed provides nourishment to the developing embryo. Endospermum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to harsh conditions."
