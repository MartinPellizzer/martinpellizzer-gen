    "intro": "Epigynium griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's epigynium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant features a slender, herbaceous stem with finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
