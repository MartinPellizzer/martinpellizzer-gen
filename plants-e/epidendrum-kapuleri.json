    "intro": "Epidendrum kapuleri, commonly known as the Kapuleri orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum kapuleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under appropriate conditions."
