    "intro": "Elymus desertorum var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved desertgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grassland ecosystems."
