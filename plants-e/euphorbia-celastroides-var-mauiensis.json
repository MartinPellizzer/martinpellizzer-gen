    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited to arid and coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
