    "intro": "Ervum capreolatum, commonly known as the wild vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
