    "intro": "Eperua, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its hard, dark wood used in furniture and musical instruments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods. Eperua species are often found in moist, shaded environments within rainforests. The genus includes several species, such as Eperua falcata and Eperua serratifolia, which are valued for both their ecological and economic importance."
