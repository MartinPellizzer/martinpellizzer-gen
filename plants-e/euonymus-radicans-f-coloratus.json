    "intro": "Euonymus radicans f. coloratus, commonly known as the red-veined ivy, is a compact, trailing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking red veins that contrast vividly against the foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant leaf coloration and year-round visual interest."
