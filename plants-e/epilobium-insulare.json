    "intro": "Epilobium insulare, commonly known as the island willow or coastal willow, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. Epilobium insulare plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
