    "intro": "Elymus andinus, commonly known as the Andean wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Elymus andinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
