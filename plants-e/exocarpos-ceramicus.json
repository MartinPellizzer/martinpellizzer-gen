It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing sweet, edible pulp. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in dry climates. The fruit is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and as a food source."
