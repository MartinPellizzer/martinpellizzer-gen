    "intro": "Euphorbia alluaudii, commonly known as the alluaudii spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branching spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia alluaudii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience."
