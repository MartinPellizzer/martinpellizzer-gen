    "intro": "Euphorbia rauhii, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a unique appearance with its pale green, almost translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
