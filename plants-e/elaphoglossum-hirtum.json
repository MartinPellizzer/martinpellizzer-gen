    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are typically short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized indusium."
