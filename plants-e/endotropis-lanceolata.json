It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically broad and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Its root system is notable for containing starchy tubers, which have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The botanical features of Endotropis lanceolata make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and potential agricultural use."
