    "intro": "Epimedium ecalcaratum, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features palmately divided, bright green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and early blooming habit."
