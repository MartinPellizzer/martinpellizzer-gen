    "intro": "Euphorbia edulis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
