    "intro": "Eucephalus tomentellus, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional herbal practices."
