    "intro": "Eurycaulis lucens, commonly known as the luminous bluetail, is a strikingly unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vivid blue foliage and elongated, trailing stems that drape gracefully over rocky outcrops. The plant's leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters of bright yellow, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as nocturnal moths. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Eurycaulis lucens is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
