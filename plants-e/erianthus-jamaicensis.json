    "intro": "Erianthus jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican grass or wild sugarcane, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and large, elongated leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its fibrous stalks have been traditionally used for thatching and as a source of fiber."
