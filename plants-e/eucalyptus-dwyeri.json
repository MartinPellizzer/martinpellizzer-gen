    "intro": "Eucalyptus dwyeri, commonly known as the Dwyer's malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of south-western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and pink beneath, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Eucalyptus dwyeri is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
