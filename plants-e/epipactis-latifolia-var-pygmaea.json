    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces sporangia that release spores for reproduction. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epipactis latifolia."
