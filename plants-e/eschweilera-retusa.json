    "intro": "Eschweilera retusa, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, red-orange flowers that attract various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
