It is characterized by its large, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
