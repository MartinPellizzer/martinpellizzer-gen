    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its most distinctive characteristic is the bright red, fleshy fruits that develop after flowering. Euphorbia erythrocarpa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions."
