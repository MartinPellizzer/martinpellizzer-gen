    "intro": "Eusteralis helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eusteralis helferi is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
