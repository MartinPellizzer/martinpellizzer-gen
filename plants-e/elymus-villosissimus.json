    "intro": "Elymus villosissimus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Elymus villosissimus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control."
