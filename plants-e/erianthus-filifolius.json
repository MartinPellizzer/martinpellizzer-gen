    "intro": "Erianthus filifolius, commonly known as the silky grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a silky texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental and native plant gardens. Erianthus filifolius is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
