    "intro": "Erysimum thyrsoideum subsp. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found along cliffs and slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering period is short, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other Erysimum species."
