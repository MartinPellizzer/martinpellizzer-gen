    "intro": "Euphorbia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
