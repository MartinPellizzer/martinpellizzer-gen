    "intro": "Eugenia durifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple or black berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Eugenia durifolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
