It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Eustaxia alba is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
