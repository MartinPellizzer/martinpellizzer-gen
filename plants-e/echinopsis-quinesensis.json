    "intro": "Echinopsis quinesensis, commonly known as the Quinesense Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces striking, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
