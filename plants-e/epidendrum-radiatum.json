    "intro": "Epidendrum radiatum, commonly known as the Radiate Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum radiatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
