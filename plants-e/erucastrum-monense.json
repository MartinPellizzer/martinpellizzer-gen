    "intro": "Erucastrum monense, commonly known as the Mexican wallaby pea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erucastrum monense is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging conditions."
