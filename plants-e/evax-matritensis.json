    "intro": "Evax matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
