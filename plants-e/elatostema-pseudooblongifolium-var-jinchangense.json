    "intro": "Elatostema pseudooblongifolium var. jinchangense, commonly known as the Jinchang elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
