    "intro": "Eplingia saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Eplingia saxicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in desert and foothill habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
