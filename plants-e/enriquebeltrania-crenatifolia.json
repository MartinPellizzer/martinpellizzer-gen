    "intro": "Enriquebeltrania crenatifolia, commonly known as the crested fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, crinkled fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are leathery and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
