    "intro": "Euphorbia multiramosa, commonly known as the branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia multiramosa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
