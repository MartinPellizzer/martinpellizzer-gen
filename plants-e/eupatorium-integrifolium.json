    "intro": "Eupatorium integrifolium, commonly known as boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, toothed leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer to early fall. Boneset is commonly found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodlands. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
