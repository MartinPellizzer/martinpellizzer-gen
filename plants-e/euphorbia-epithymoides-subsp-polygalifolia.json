    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides subsp. polygalifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
