    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the Mitchell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
