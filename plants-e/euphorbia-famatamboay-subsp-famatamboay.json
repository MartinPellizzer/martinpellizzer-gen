    "intro": "Euphorbia famatamboay subsp. famatamboay, commonly known as the Famatamboay euphorbia, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features a dense, branching structure with small, green leaves and produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it has a slow growth rate, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
