    "intro": "Erigeron mucronatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
