    "intro": "Eugenia brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's eucalypt, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern rainforests of Australia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
