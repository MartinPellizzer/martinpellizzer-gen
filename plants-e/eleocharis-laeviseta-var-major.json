It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and pale green color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks."
