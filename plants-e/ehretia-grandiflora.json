    "intro": "Ehretia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Ehretia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
