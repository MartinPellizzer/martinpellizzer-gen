It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Eragrostis microstachya is often found in association with other native grasses and forbs in its native range."
