    "intro": "Equisetum palustre subvar. apiculatum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its retention of primitive vascular structures, including megaphylls and microphylls. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils along waterways. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse wildlife."
