It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive silvery-white variegation and a pleasant, slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
