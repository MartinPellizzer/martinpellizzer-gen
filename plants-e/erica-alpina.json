    "intro": "Erica alpina, commonly known as the Alpine heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. Erica alpina thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments with cold temperatures and strong winds. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
