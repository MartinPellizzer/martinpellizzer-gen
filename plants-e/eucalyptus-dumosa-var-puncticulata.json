    "intro": "Eucalyptus dumosa var. puncticulata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, serrated margin. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry, open woodlands and heathlands."
