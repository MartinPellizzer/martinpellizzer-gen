    "intro": "Eria compressoclavata, commonly known as the narrow-clawed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive compressed labellum that gives the species its specific epithet. Eria compressoclavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
