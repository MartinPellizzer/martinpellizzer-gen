    "intro": "Elatostema cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often dispersed by animals. Elatostema cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
