    "intro": "Erica holosericea var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or pale purple in color. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, evergreen ground cover."
