    "intro": "Eriachne capillaris, commonly known as slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a species of grass native to Australia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Eriachne capillaris plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in some horticultural settings."
