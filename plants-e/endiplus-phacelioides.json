It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions, with a shallow root system and rapid life cycle."
