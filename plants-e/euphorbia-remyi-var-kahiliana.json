    "intro": "Euphorbia remyi var. kahiliana, commonly known as the Kahiliana euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically green and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia remyi var. kahiliana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
