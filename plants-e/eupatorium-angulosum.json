    "intro": "Eupatorium angulosum, commonly known as roughside eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and rough to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium angulosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
