    "intro": "Eremostachys thyrsiflora, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eremostachys thyrsiflora is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
