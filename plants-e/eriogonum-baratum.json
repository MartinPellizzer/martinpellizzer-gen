    "intro": "Eriogonum baratum, commonly known as the San Joaquin bursage, is a flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces bracts that resemble small burs, which can adhere to animals and aid in seed dispersal. Eriogonum baratum is often found in chaparral and scrubland ecosystems."
