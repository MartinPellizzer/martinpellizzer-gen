    "intro": "Enckea amalago var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable enckea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, variegated leaves that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique foliage, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
