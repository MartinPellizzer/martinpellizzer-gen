    "intro": "Eschatogramme polypodioides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are dispersed by wind. The golden polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
