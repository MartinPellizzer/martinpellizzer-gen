    "intro": "Evolvulus comosus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Evolvulus comosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and easy care requirements."
