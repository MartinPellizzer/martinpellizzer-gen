    "intro": "Elymus rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize soil in rocky and arid habitats. Elymus rechingeri is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
