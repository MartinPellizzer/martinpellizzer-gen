    "intro": "Eigia, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, making it an excellent choice for trellises or vertical gardens. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it popular among gardeners. However, it requires full sun and well-draining soil to flourish."
