It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, pale green or white flower. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Edwardia lurida is considered critically endangered."
