It features simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or red center. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
