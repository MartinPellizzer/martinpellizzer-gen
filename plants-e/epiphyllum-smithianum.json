    "intro": "Epiphyllum smithianum, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is a flowering plant native to Mexico and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that resemble leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming at night. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
