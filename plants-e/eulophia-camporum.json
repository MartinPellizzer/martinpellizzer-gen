It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Eulophia camporum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
