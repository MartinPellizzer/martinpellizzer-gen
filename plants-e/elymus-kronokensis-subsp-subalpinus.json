    "intro": "Elymus kronokensis subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in alpine and subalpine habitats."
