    "intro": "Elliottia paniculata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in terminal panicles during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is well adapted to wetland and swampy environments, often found in the Florida Panhandle and along the Gulf Coast. Elliottia paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
