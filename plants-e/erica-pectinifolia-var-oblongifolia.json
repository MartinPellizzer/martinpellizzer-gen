    "intro": "Erica pectinifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive pectinate (toothed) margin, giving the plant its species name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
