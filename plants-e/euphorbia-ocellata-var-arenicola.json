    "intro": "Euphorbia ocellata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically small and spatulate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts."
