It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is narrower than the rest of the petals, giving it its scientific name. Epidendrum trapezilabiatum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
