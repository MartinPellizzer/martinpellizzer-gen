    "intro": "Espeletia brassicoidea subsp. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heather, is a succulent plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the arid and high-altitude environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers during the dry season, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads and specialized structures. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
