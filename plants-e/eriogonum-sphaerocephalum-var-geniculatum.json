    "intro": "Eriogonum sphaerocephalum var. geniculatum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions, contributing to local biodiversity."
