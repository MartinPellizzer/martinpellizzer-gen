    "intro": "Epidendrum acunae, commonly known as the Acuna Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and red. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Epidendrum acunae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
