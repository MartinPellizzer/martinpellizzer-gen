It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often adorned with lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
