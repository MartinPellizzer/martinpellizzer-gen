    "intro": "Epilobium sylvaticum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or purple petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
