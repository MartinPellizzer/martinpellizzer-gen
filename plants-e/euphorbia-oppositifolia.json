    "intro": "Euphorbia oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching stems and opposite leaf arrangement, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Euphorbia oppositifolia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
