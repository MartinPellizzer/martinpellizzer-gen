It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
