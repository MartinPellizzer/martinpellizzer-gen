    "intro": "Euphorbia jovetii, commonly known as the Red Hot Poker, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
