    "intro": "Ephedra campylopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Ephedra campylopoda is part of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the coniferous plants. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to increased scientific interest in its chemical composition and potential medicinal properties."
