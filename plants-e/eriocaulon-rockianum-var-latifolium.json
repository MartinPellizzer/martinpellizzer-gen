    "intro": "Eriocaulon rockianum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broad at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to other varieties within the Eriocaulon genus."
