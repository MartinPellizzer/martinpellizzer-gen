    "intro": "Embothrium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty embothrium, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Embothrium ferrugineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
