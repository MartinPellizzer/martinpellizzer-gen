    "intro": "Euphorbia kanalensis, commonly known as the Kanal euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
