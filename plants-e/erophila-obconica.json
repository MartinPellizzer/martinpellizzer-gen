    "intro": "Erophila obconica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are often submerged or floating. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters and are pollinated by insects. Erophila obconica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
