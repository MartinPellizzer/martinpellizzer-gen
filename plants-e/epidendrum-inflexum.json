    "intro": "Epidendrum inflexum, commonly known as the Spur Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, raceme-like inflorescence and its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, providing a sturdy base for the flowering stems. Epidendrum inflexum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
