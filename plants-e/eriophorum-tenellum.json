    "intro": "Eriophorum tenellum, commonly known as the slender cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as tundra, bogs, and marshes. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs. Eriophorum tenellum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important component of the flora in polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
