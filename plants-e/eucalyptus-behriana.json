    "intro": "Eucalyptus behriana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus behriana thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in native landscapes. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
