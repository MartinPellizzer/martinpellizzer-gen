    "intro": "Euonymus forbesii, commonly known as the red-edged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, ovate leaves that are typically green with a distinctive red margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus forbesii is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
