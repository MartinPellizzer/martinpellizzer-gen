    "intro": "Erica marioides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica marioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
