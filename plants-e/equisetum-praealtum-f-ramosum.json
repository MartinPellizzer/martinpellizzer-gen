    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum f. ramosum, commonly known as the creeping marsh horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a distinct, hollow stem. This plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
