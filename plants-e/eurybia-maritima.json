    "intro": "Eurybia maritima, commonly known as sea inula, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eurybia maritima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various coastal invertebrates and birds."
