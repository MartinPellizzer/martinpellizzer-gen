    "intro": "Elaphoglossum orbignyanum, commonly known as the orbignyanum holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum orbignyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
