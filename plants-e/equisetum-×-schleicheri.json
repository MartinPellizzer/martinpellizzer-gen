    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 schleicheri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is characterized by its jointed, green stems that lack true leaves, with small, scale-like structures along the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its inability to reproduce sexually, it relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
