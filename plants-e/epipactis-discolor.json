    "intro": "Epipactis discolor, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epipactis discolor is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
