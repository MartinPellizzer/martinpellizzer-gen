    "intro": "Eleusine rigida, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry and arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions. Eleusine rigida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
