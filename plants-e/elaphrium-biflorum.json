    "intro": "Elaphrium biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered elaphrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphrium biflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
