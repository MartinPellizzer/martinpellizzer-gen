    "intro": "Echinopsis intricatissima, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and xeriscaping."
