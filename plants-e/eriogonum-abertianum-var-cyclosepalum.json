    "intro": "Eriogonum abertianum var. cyclosepalum, commonly known as the Abert's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its ecological importance to local pollinators."
