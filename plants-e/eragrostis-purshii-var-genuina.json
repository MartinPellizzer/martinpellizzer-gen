It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, making it an important component of native plant communities."
