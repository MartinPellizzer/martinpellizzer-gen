    "intro": "Epilobium junceum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both a common weed and an important component of certain ecosystems."
