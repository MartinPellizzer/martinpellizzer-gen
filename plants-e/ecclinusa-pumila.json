    "intro": "Ecclinusa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Ecclinusa pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
