    "intro": "Eucalyptus papillosa, commonly known as the silky gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine silvery down. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they are borne in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, open forests and woodland areas. Eucalyptus papillosa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment, showing resilience to drought and fire."
