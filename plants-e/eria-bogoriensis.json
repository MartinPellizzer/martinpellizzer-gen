    "intro": "Eria bogoriensis, commonly known as the Bogoriensis Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
