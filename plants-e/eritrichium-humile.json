    "intro": "Eritrichium humile, commonly known as the dwarf mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are delicate, blue to purple blossoms that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Eritrichium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators."
