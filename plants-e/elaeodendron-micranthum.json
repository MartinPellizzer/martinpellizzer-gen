    "intro": "Elaeodendron micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered elaeodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its botanical features include a woody stem and capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
