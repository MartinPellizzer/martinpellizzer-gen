    "intro": "Epidendrum palalabrum, commonly known as the Purple Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
