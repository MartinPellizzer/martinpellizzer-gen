    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana subsp. pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, including high UV radiation and limited soil nutrients. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
