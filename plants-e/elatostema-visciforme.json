    "intro": "Elatostema visciforme, commonly known as the sticky leaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are typically covered in a sticky substance. Elatostema visciforme thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
