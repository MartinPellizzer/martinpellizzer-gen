    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides var. sventenii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and dense clusters of fleshy, green stems that branch out like a candelabra. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing a yellowish-green cyathium surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
