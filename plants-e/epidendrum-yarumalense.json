    "intro": "Epidendrum yarumalense, commonly known as the Yarumal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
