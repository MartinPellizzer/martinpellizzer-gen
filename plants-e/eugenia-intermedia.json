It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
