    "intro": "Eleocharis khandwaensis, commonly known as the Khandwa sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is often found in regions with high humidity and poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
