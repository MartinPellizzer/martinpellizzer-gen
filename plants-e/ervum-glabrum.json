    "intro": "Ervum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several small, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Ervum glabrum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
