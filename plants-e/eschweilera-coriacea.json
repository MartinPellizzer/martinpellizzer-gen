    "intro": "Eschweilera coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has compound leaves with a leathery texture. Eschweilera coriacea is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
