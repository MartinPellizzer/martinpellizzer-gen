    "intro": "Elaphoglossum commutatum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature common among ferns. Elaphoglossum commutatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
