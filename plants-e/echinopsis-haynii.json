It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, radial spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer.

Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
