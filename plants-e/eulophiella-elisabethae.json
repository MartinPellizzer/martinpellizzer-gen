    "intro": "Eulophiella elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
