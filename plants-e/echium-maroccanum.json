    "intro": "Echium maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan fleur-de-lis, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, characterized by its tall, spiny stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces unique, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Echium maroccanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
