    "intro": "Erodium sanguis-christi subsp. durrieui, commonly known as the Durrieu's sticky eryngo, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The species is characterized by its distinctive sticky glands on the leaves and stems, which help in water retention."
