    "intro": "Euphrasia verecunda, commonly known as the yellow burnet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Euphrasia verecunda is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
