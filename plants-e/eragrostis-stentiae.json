    "intro": "Eragrostis stentiae, commonly known as the Stent's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eragrostis stentiae is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of savannas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
