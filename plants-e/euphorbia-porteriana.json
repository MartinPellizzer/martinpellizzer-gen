    "intro": "Euphorbia porteriana, commonly known as the Porter's spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
