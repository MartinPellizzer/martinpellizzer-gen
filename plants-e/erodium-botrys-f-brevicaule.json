    "intro": "Erodium botrys f. brevicaule, commonly known as the dwarf clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Erodium botrys."
