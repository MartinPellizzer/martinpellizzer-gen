    "intro": "Euphorbia striata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem covered in spiny, triangular-shaped leaves that are typically green with a faint bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
