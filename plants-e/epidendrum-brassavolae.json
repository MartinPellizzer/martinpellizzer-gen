    "intro": "Epidendrum brassavolae, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Epidendrum brassavolae prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
