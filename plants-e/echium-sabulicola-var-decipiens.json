    "intro": "Echium sabulicola var. decipiens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
