    "intro": "Echeveria bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of vibrant pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its color and shape. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
