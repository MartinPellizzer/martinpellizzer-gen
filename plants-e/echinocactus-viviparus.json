    "intro": "Echinocactus viviparus, commonly known as the living stone cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce offsets, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem covered in white, woolly spines that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring. Echinocactus viviparus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
