    "intro": "Elytrigia clivorum, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Elytrigia clivorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
