    "intro": "Erythroxylum emarginatum var. dekindtii, commonly known as the De Kindt's coca, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, reddish-brown capsules containing the characteristic coca leaves. These leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cocaine, and are used in traditional medicine and ritual practices. It is an important species in the study of plant alkaloids and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
