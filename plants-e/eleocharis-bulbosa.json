    "intro": "Eleocharis bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils. Eleocharis bulbosa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
