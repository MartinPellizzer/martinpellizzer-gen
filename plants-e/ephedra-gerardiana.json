    "intro": "Ephedra gerardiana, commonly known as the desert tea or St. John's wort of the desert, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and red-brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ephedra gerardiana is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties."
