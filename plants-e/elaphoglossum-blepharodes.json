    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blepharodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum blepharodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
