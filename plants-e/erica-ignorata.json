    "intro": "Erica ignorata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Erica ignorata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
