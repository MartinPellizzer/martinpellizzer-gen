    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanosum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriophyllum lanosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
