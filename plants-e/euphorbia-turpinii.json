    "intro": "Euphorbia turpinii, commonly known as the Turpin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia turpinii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions."
