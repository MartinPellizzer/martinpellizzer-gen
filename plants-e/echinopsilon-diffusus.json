    "intro": "Echinopsilon diffusus, commonly known as the hairy echinops, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruit heads that resemble those of the echinops genus, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Echinopsilon diffusus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
