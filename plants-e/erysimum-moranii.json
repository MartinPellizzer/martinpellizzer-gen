    "intro": "Erysimum moranii, commonly known as the Moroccan wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Erysimum moranii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
