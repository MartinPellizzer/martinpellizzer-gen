    "intro": "Elaeocarpus lanceifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically leathery and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits. The fruits contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril, which is a characteristic feature of the Elaeocarpaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
