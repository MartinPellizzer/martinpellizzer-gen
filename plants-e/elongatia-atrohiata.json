    "intro": "Elongatia atrohiata, commonly known as the black-stemmed elongated fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that grow in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant has a distinctive dark purple to black stem, which contrasts with its light green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
