    "intro": "Erigeron schuechtii, commonly known as the Desert Blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as hairy stems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
