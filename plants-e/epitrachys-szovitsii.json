    "intro": "Epitrachys szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' epitrachys, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Epitrachys szovitsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
