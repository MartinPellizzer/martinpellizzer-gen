    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other helleborines, with a distinctive hooded structure that protects the reproductive organs. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
