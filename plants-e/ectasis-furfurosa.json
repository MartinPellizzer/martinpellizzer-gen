    "intro": "Ectasis furfurosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Ectasis furfurosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands."
