    "intro": "Elatostema surigaoense, commonly known as the Surigao elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. Native to the Philippines, particularly the province of Surigao del Sur, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short stem and often grows close to the ground, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
