    "intro": "Eulalia hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy grass or rough grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Eulalia hirtifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
