    "intro": "Epidendrum suinii, commonly known as the \"Pig's Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white to yellowish in color. Its flowers have a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. Epidendrum suinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
