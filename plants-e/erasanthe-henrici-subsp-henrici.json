    "intro": "Erasanthe henrici subsp. henrici, commonly known as the Henrici's erasanthe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
