    "intro": "Elaeocarpus nutans, commonly known as the nodding elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescences and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink in color. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are typically surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. This plant is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
