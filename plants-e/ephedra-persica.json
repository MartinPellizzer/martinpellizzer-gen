    "intro": "Ephedra persica, commonly known as Persian ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is also considered a potential hallucinogenic plant."
