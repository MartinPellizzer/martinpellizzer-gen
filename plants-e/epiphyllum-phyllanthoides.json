    "intro": "Epiphyllum phyllanthoides, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a climbing or shrub-like plant with flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming at night. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
