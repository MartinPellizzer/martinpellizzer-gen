It features tall, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette, with striking purple and white bracts that resemble a fountain. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Eucomis bicolor is drought-tolerant and often used in gardens for its architectural form and seasonal color."
