    "intro": "Euphorbia imaii f. denudata, commonly known as the naked euphorbia, is a unique variant of the Euphorbia imaii species. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with most leaves absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant features a branched stem covered in small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Japan and thrives in dry, rocky environments. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized gardens."
