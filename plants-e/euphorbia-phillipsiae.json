It features a branched stem with small, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia phillipsiae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
