    "intro": "Echinops tjanschanicus, commonly known as the Tjanschan Desert Thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown and silver-gray leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Echinops tjanschanicus plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
