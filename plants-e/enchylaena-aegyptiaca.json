    "intro": "Enchylaena aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian fig tree, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, with a dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to figs. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a slightly serrated margin. Enchylaena aegyptiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
