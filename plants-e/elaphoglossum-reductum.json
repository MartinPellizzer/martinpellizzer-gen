It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, orbicular spore cases called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Elaphoglossum reductum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
