It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
