    "intro": "Eriogonum covillei, commonly known as Coville's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as hillsides and sagebrush steppe. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces hard, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Coville's buckwheat is an important part of local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
