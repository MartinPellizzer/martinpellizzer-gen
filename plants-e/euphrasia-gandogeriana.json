    "intro": "Euphrasia gandogeriana, commonly known as the Gandoger's eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling tiny eyes, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
