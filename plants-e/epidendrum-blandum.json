    "intro": "Epidendrum blandum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms during the warmer months. Epidendrum blandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
