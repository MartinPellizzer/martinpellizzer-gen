    "intro": "Eriachne basalis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Eriachne basalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience in wetland ecosystems."
