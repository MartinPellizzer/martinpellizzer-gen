    "intro": "Ephedra viridis, commonly known as green ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its jointed, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often inconspicuous. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Ephedra viridis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its efficient water conservation mechanisms. It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound with historical medicinal uses."
