    "intro": "Elachyptera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Elachyptera parvifolia is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
