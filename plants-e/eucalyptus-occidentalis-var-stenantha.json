    "intro": "Eucalyptus occidentalis var. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length, and are often glaucous in appearance. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually cream or pale yellow in color, and its wood is valued for its durability and workability. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
