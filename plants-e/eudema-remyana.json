    "intro": "Eudema remyana, commonly known as the silverleaf eudema, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
