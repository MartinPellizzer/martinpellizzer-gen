    "intro": "Euryomyrtus denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to southeastern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Euryomyrtus denticulata is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
