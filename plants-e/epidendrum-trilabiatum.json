    "intro": "Epidendrum trilabiatum, commonly known as the three-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush green backdrop to its colorful blooms. Epidendrum trilabiatum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
