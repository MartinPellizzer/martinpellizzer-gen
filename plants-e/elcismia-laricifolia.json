    "intro": "Elcismia laricifolia, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a crucial food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are needle-like and typically grow in clusters of five, giving it a unique appearance. Elcismia laricifolia thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
