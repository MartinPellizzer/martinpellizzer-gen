    "intro": "Eleutherococcus scandens, commonly known as climbing eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with serrated edges. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
