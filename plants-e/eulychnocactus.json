    "intro": "Eulychnocactus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Eulychnocactus is valued for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit."
