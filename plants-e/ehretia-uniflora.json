It features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Ehretia uniflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
