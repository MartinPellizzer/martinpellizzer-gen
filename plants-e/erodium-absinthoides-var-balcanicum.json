It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain regions."
