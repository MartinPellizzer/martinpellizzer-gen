It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Eupatorium miradorense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
