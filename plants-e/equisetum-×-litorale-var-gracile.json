    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. gracile, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid species that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum \u00d7 gracile. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant features slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are reduced to small, needle-like structures, and it is often found in salt-tolerant environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and its unique appearance in maritime landscapes."
