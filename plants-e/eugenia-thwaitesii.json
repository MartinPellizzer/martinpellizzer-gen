    "intro": "Eugenia thwaitesii, commonly known as the Waites' guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
