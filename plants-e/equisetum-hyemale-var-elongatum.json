    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. elongatum, commonly known as the tall scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems compared to the typical form of Equisetum hyemale."
