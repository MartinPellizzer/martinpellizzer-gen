    "intro": "Equisetum bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 horsetail, is a species of horsetail native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are important for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous and boggy environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a unique combination of ancient and modern plant features."
