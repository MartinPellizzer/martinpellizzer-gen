    "intro": "Erianthus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of rivers, thriving in moist and saline environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green or brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Erianthus bengalensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
