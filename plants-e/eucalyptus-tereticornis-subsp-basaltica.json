    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis subsp. basaltica, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a medium to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range from grey to white. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, often found in basaltic regions."
