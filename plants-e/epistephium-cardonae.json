    "intro": "Epistephium cardonae, commonly known as the cactus of the Canary Islands, is a species of cactus native to the island of Tenerife. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its structure is adapted for minimal water loss, with a waxy coating on its surface. Epistephium cardonae plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert organisms."
