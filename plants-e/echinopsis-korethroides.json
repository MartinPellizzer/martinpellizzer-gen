    "intro": "Echinopsis korethroides, commonly known as the Tropicana cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant."
