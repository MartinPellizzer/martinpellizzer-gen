    "intro": "Epidendrum verecundum, commonly known as the Purple Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence that bears numerous violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Epidendrum verecundum is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
