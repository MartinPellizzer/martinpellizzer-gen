    "intro": "Epidendrum cornurepens, commonly known as the horned epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often curved flower spikes that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with prominent lip petals that are often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum cornurepens is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
