    "intro": "Eleutherococcus pseudosetulosus, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia and northern China. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties. Its root system is often harvested for use in herbal remedies, though it is less commercially significant than other species of Eleutherococcus."
