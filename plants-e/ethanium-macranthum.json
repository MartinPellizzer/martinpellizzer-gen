    "intro": "Ethanium macranthum, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Ethanium macranthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
