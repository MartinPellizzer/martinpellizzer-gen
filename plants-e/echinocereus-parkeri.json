    "intro": "Echinocereus parkeri, commonly known as the night-blooming hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers at night, which open only after sunset and close by morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid environments. Echinocereus parkeri is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in drought conditions."
