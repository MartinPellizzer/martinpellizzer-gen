    "intro": "Eragrostis rubens var. scabriuscula, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
