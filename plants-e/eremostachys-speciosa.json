    "intro": "Eremostachys speciosa, commonly known as the showy eremostachys, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are showy and often pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. Eremostachys speciosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
