    "intro": "Eriocaulon albocapitatum, commonly known as the white-headed flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale-colored flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Eriocaulon albocapitatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
