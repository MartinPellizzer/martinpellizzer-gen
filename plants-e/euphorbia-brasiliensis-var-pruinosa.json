    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis var. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Spurge, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
