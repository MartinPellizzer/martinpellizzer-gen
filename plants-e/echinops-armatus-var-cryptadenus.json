    "intro": "Echinops armatus var. cryptadenus, commonly known as the hairy thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and hairy foliage, which are typical features of the Echinops genus. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered at the base of the plant."
