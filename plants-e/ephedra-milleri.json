    "intro": "Ephedra milleri, commonly known as the desert tea, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to arid environments. It contains ephedrine, a compound with medicinal uses, though it is now regulated due to its potential for abuse. Ephedra milleri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
