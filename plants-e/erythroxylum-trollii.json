    "intro": "Erythroxylum trollii, commonly known as the Troll's erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain elliptical seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Erythroxylum trollii is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
