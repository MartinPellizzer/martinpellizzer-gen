    "intro": "Eugenia rigens, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature, which are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia rigens thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
