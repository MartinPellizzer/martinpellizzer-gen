    "intro": "Echeveria quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian snowplant, is a succulent native to the Andean regions of Peru. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces striking clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
