    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typically emerging later in the growing season than other horsetail species. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments across Europe."
