It is characterized by its narrow, sharply pointed leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
