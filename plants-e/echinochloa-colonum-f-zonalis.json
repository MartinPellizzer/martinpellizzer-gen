    "intro": "Echinochloa colonum f. zonalis, commonly known as the zonal grass or zonal wild rice, is a variant of the common barnyard grass. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive zonation of leaf color, with lighter green bands alternating with darker green. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in wetlands and along water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This grass is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ecological and historical significance."
