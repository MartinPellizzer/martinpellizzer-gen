    "intro": "Elatine pilosa, commonly known as hairy waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its tiny, opposite leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length and have a waxy surface. Elatine pilosa produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
