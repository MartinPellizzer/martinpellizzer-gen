    "intro": "Erica arborea subsp. riojana, commonly known as the Rioja heath, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often in open woodlands and scrublands. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
