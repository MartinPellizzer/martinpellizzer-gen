    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gamboanum, commonly known as the Gamboanum holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the genus Elaphoglossum."
