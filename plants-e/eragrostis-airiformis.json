    "intro": "Eragrostis airiformis, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it visually distinct from other grasses. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with a fluffy, airy appearance, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, Eragrostis airiformis is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
