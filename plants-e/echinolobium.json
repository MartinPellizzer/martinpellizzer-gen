    "intro": "Echinolobium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and striking, often blue or purple, flower heads that resemble small holly berries. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and rocky soils, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. The flowers are usually arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and the genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes. Echinolobium species are valued for their hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
