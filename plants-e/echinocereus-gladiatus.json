    "intro": "Echinocereus gladiatus, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that resemble swords, which are typically green and covered with white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Echinocereus gladiatus is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions."
