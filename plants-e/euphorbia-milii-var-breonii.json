    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. breonii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the bloom. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
