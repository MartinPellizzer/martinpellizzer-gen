    "intro": "Echium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and grasslands. Echium angustifolium is also valued for its medicinal properties due to the high content of omega-6 fatty acids in its seeds."
