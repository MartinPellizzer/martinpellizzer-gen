    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum subsp. androgynum, commonly known as the male willow-owlet, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic organisms. This subspecies is notable for its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants."
