    "intro": "Erigeron lucidus, commonly known as the shining fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are usually pale blue to white and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
