    "intro": "Echinops pubisquameus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of tightly packed, bristly bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Echinops pubisquameus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
