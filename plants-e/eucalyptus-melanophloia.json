    "intro": "Eucalyptus melanophloia, commonly known as the blackwood, is a tall, evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its durable timber and has cultural significance to Indigenous Australian communities."
