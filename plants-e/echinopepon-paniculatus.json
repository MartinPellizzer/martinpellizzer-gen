    "intro": "Echinopepon paniculatus, commonly known as the paniculate melon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to spherical, green fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, typical of many Cucurbitaceae species. The fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of its family."
