    "intro": "Euphorbia gossypina subsp. mangulensis, commonly known as the Mangulensis Spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and Hispaniola. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and a distinctive, branched inflorescence called a cyathium. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
