    "intro": "Encyclia olivacea, commonly known as the Olive Encyclia, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Encyclia olivacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
