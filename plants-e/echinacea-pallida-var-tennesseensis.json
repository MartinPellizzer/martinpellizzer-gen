    "intro": "Echinacea pallida var. tennesseensis, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a prominent yellow central disk, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces a tall, sturdy stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. This variety is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
