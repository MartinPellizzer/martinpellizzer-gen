It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum nortonii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
