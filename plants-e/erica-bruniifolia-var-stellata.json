It features dense, compact foliage with small, evergreen leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal areas."
