It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Euphorbia ramulosa is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its stems, forming dense mats."
