    "intro": "Euphorbia iteophylla, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
