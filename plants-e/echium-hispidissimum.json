    "intro": "Echium hispidissimum, commonly known as the hispid echium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Echium hispidissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
