It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plants are native to Australia and are often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. Euryomyrtus species are typically shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. They play an important role in local ecosystems and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
