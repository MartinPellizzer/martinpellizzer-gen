    "intro": "Eriogonum ampullaceum, commonly known as the whiteleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert areas. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum ampullaceum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
