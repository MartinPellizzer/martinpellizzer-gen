    "intro": "Echinopsis cardenasiana, commonly known as the Candelabra Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a crown of spiny, globular stems, giving it a distinctive candelabra-like appearance. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. It is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Echinopsis cardenasiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
