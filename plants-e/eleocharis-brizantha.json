    "intro": "Eleocharis brizantha, commonly known as grass spike rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, composed of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it often forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Eleocharis brizantha is also valued for its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
