    "intro": "Euphorbia maculata var. parvula, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, branched stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. It is characterized by its ability to exude a milky sap when damaged, a trait common among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. This variety is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland and swampy areas."
