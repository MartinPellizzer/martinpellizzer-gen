    "intro": "Elaeagnus sativa, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, often inconspicuous, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Elaeagnus sativa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil improvement and reforestation efforts."
