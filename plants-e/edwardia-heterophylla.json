It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often variable leaf shapes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
