    "intro": "Elatostema hoelscherianum, commonly known as the Hoelscher's prostrate elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically rounded or ovate, with a hairy surface and a distinctive leaflet structure. It produces small greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
