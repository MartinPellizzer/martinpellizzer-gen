    "intro": "Eschscholzia confinis, commonly known as the San Diego poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known poppies. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, Eschscholzia confinis is considered a rare and endangered species."
