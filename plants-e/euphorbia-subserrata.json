    "intro": "Euphorbia subserrata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia subserrata is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
