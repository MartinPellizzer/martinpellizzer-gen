    "intro": "Euphorbia longiradiata, commonly known as the long-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem with spiny, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem for survival. Euphorbia longiradiata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
