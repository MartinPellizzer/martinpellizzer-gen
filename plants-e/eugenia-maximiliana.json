It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use. The fruit, though not typically consumed by humans, is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
