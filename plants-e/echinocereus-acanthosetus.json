    "intro": "Echinocereus acanthosetus, commonly known as the black\u68d8 cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often pollinated by bees and other insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
