    "intro": "Elytrigia calcarea, commonly known as limestone grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops. Elytrigia calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
