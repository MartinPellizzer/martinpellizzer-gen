    "intro": "Epidorkis xanthopollinia, commonly known as the golden polly orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and orange floral colors, which are particularly vibrant during the flowering season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
