    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrina, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branched, woody stem with spiny, triangular leaves that are often red or purple in color. The plant produces striking red or orange cyathium flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
