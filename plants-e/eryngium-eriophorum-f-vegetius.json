It is characterized by its slender, spiny leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The plant's rigid structure and unique appearance make it a striking addition to rock gardens and borders."
