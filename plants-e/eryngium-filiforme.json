It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and a tall, branching stem. Eryngium filiforme is often found in sagebrush steppe and is an important component of its local ecosystem."
