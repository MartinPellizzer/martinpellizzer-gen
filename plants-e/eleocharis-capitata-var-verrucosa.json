    "intro": "Eleocharis capitata var. verrucosa, commonly known as the verrucous spike-rush, is a sedge species characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The varietal form *verrucosa* is distinguished by its rough, warty surface on the stems and leaves."
