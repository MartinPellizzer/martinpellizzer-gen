    "intro": "Elytrigia caespitosa subsp. nodosa, commonly known as nodose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in various soil types."
