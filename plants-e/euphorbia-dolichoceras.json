    "intro": "Euphorbia dolichoceras, commonly known as the long-stalked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its spiny, cylindrical stems and yellowish-green sap. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia dolichoceras is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience."
