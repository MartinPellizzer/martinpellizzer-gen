    "intro": "Euphorbia enopla var. viridis, commonly known as the green euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or yellowish in color, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
