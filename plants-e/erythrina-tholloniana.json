    "intro": "Erythrina tholloniana, commonly known as the red flame acacia, is a deciduous legume native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant."
