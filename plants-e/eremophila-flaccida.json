    "intro": "Eremophila flaccida, commonly known as the sticky leaf eremophila, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Eremophila flaccida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
