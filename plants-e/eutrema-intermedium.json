It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, adapting to saline and wind-swept environments. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded seeds in pods. Eutrema intermedium is often found in dune habitats and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
