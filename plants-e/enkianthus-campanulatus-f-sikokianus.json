    "intro": "Enkianthus campanulatus f. sikokianus, commonly known as the Sikokian bellflower, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable species in horticulture and conservation efforts."
