    "intro": "Eremitis riodocensis, commonly known as the Riodocense Ghost Fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in its nocturnal pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eremitis riodocensis is considered an endangered species."
