    "intro": "Eulophia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Africa. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eulophia schweinfurthii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
