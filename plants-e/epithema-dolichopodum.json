    "intro": "Epithema dolichopodum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can efficiently capture small insects and crustaceans. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The botanical features of Epithema dolichopodum reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments through its unique trapping mechanism."
