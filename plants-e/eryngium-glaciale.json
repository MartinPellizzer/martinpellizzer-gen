    "intro": "Eryngium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier eryngium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spiky flower heads, which are surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Eryngium glaciale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
