    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 angularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often found in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, globular flower spikes in shades of white to pink, which attract various pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and for erosion control in arid regions."
