It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves, and its flowering stems bear numerous small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves are characteristic of the Asteraceae family, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
