    "intro": "Eritrichium secundiflorum, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and low-growing habit, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It blooms in the spring and is often associated with high-altitude ecosystems. Eritrichium secundiflorum plays a role in pollination and is a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
