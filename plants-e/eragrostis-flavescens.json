    "intro": "Eragrostis flavescens, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn golden in color. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Eragrostis flavescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting local wildlife."
