    "intro": "Eugenia triplinervia var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-veined eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with broad, prominent veins, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
