    "intro": "Euphorbia ephedroides var. debilis, commonly known as the weak euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, branched structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
