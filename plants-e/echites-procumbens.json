    "intro": "Echites procumbens, commonly known as the creeping echites, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Echites procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
