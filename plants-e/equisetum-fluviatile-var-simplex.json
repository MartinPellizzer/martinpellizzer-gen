    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. simplex, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it lacks true leaves and flowers. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and paleobotanical importance."
