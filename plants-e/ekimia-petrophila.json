    "intro": "Ekimia petrophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically has a short, underground stem with a single leaf and a flowering spike that produces small, delicate flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
