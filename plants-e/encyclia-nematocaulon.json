    "intro": "Encyclia nematocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering. The plant produces linear, often hairy leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
