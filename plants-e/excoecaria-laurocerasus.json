It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth, though it can become invasive in certain regions. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
