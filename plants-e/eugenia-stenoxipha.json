    "intro": "Eugenia stenoxipha, commonly known as the narrow-lobed eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that have a narrow, pointed tip. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Eugenia stenoxipha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal flowering."
