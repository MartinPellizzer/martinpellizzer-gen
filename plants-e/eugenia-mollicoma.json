    "intro": "Eugenia mollicoma, commonly known as the velvet eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Eugenia mollicoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a tropical touch in subtropical climates."
