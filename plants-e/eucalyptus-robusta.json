    "intro": "Eucalyptus robusta, commonly known as Sydney red gum, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to red-brown bark that peels in long strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue when young, turning grey-green with age. It produces small, spherical flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats."
