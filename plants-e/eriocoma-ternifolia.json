It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriocoma ternifolia is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
