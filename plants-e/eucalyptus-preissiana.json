    "intro": "Eucalyptus preissiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late summer to autumn. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin layers, revealing a mottled appearance. Eucalyptus preissiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
