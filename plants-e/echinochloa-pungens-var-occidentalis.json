    "intro": "Echinochloa pungens var. occidentalis, commonly known as western prickly grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sharp, spiny leaf margins and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
