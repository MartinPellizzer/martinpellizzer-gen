    "intro": "Euphorbia sumati, commonly known as the Sumatran spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique cyathium, which is a cup-like structure that contains the flowers and glandular structures. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia sumati is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
