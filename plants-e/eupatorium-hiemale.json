    "intro": "Eupatorium hiemale, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called umbels. These flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas."
