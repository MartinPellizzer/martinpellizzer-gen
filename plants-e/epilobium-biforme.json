    "intro": "Epilobium biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects. Epilobium biforme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
