    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 montana, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green hue due to a waxy coating. Eucalyptus \u00d7 montana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
