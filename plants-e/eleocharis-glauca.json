    "intro": "Eleocharis glauca, commonly known as blue spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale blue to greenish in color, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Eleocharis glauca is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological stability of wetland habitats. It plays a role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
