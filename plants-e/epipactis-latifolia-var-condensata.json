    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. condensata, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is notable for its morphological variation and is often found in association with specific soil types and microhabitats."
