    "intro": "Eremopanax hederoides, commonly known as the ivy-like cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of ivy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
