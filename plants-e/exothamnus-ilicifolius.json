    "intro": "Exothamnus ilicifolius, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slight resinous scent, which is a common trait among members of the Lamiaceae family. Exothamnus ilicifolius is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
