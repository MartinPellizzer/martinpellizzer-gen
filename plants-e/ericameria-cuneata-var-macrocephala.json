    "intro": "Ericameria cuneata var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
