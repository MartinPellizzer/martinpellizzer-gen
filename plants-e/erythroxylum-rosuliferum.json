    "intro": "Erythroxylum rosuliferum, commonly known as the red-leafed or red-leaf erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its striking red or pink foliage, which is a distinguishing feature of its appearance. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-white, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. This species is primarily of ornamental value due to its unique leaf coloration and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
