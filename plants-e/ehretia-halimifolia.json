    "intro": "Ehretia halimifolia, commonly known as the sweet thorn or white thorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, woodlands, and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
