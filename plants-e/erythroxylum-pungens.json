    "intro": "Erythroxylum pungens, commonly known as the red balsa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its lightweight wood, which has been historically used for model building and other crafts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Despite its ornamental value, it is not related to the coca plant, though it shares some botanical similarities."
