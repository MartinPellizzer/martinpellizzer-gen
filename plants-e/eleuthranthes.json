    "intro": "Eleuthranthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical regions of Central and South America. Eleuthranthes species are epiphytic, meaning they derive moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around their host trees. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
