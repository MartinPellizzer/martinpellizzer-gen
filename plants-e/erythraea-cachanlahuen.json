    "intro": "Erythraea cachanlahuen, commonly known as the Chilean redwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the central valleys of Chile. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in temperate rainforests with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
