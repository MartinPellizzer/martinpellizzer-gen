    "intro": "Echeveria incaica, commonly known as the Inca snowflake, is a succulent native to the Andean regions of South America. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
