    "intro": "Eupatorium rugosum var. chlorolepis, commonly known as greenleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its common name reflects the greenish coloration of its leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of boneset."
