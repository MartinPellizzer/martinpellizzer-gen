    "intro": "Eupatorium anisodontum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of violet-blue flowers at the top, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Eupatorium anisodontum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
