    "intro": "Euphorbia napoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a low-growing, compact structure with fleshy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
