    "intro": "Elymus colorans, commonly known as the red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture that helps it withstand arid conditions. Elymus colorans is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
