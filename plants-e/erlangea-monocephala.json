    "intro": "Erlangea monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed erlang, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its unique solitary flower that emerges from a single stem, often displaying vibrant colors. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea monocephala is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
