    "intro": "Erica manipuliflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a rare and striking variant of the Erica manipuliflora species. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
