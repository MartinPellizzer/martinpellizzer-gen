    "intro": "Euphorbia pteroneura, commonly known as the winged spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are often tinged with green or reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia pteroneura is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
