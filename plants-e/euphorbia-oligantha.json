    "intro": "Euphorbia oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia oligantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its toxic sap contains latex, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
