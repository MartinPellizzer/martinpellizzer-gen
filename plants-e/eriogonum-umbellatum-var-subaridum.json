    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. subaridum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This species plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
