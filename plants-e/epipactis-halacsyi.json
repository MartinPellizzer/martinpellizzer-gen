    "intro": "Epipactis halacsyi, commonly known as the Hungarian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of dark green, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with purple or brown markings. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, forest edges, and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions and is protected in several European countries."
