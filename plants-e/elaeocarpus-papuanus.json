    "intro": "Elaeocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are woody, spherical drupes that contain a single seed, and they are an important food source for various native wildlife species. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for tools and construction."
