    "intro": "Elaphoglossum trichomallum, commonly known as the hairy elaphoglossum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum trichomallum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
