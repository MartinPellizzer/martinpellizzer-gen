    "intro": "Eremostachys laciniata f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous leaf eremostachys, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs in the species but are glabrous in this particular form. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
