    "intro": "Euphrasia collina subsp. nandewarensis, commonly known as the Nandewar sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically forms dense mats, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
