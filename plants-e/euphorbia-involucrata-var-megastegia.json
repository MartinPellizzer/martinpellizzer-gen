    "intro": "Euphorbia involucrata var. megastegia, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale green hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
