    "intro": "Euonymus enantiophyllus, commonly known as the opposite-leafed woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces orange-red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Euonymus enantiophyllus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
