    "intro": "Eurya semiserrulata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
