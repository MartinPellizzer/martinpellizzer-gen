    "intro": "Ebermaiera veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, hairy seeds when mature. Ebermaiera veronicifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
