    "intro": "Eucalyptus glaucina, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-white underside, contributing to its common name. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
