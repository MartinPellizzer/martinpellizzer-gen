    "intro": "Elaeagnus geniculata, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Elaeagnus geniculata also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
