    "intro": "Emmeorhiza pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Emmeorhiza pohliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
