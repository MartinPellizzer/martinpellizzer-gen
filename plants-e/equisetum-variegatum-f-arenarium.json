    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. arenarium, commonly known as the sandhill horsetail, is a variant of the variable horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled leaves. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. This fern-like plant is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
