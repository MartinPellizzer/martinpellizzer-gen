    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-hair euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense clusters of yellowish-green, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typically green or yellow in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia flavicoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
