    "intro": "Eupatorium gnidioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
