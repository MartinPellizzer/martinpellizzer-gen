It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
