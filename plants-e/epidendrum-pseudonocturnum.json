    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudonocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Central and South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, nocturnal flowers that open in the evening. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts pollinators such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts interested in unique orchid species."
