    "intro": "Encephalartos kosiensis, commonly known as the Kosi knobbed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Zamiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically found in the Kosi Mountains region. The plant is characterized by its stout, segmented trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. It produces small, spherical cones, with the male cones typically appearing at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Encephalartos kosiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
