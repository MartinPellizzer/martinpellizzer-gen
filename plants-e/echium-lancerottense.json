    "intro": "Echium lancerottense, commonly known as the Lancerottense thistle, is a flowering plant native to the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in Mediterranean botany."
