    "intro": "Eugenia bicincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when dry, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats. Eugenia bicincta is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
