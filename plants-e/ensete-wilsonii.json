    "intro": "Ensete wilsonii, commonly known as the African elephant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It can grow up to 6 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used for thatching and roofing. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by fibrous, spindle-shaped fruits. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been traditionally used for making ropes and mats. Ensete wilsonii is well adapted to wet, swampy environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
