    "intro": "Elaphoglossum entecnum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum entecnum is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving ferns."
