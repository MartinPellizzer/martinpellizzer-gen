    "intro": "Eustachya oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, opposite leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish inflorescences that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly areas. Eustachya oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
