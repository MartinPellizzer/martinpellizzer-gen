    "intro": "Euphorbia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic spurge, is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stem to attach to host plants. Euphorbia parasitica is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it grows on the roots or stems of other plants."
