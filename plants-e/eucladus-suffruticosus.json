    "intro": "Eucladus suffruticosus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. Eucladus suffruticosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species in dry climates. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not extensively studied."
