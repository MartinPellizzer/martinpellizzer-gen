    "intro": "Erica mitchelliensis, commonly known as the Mitchell's heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Erica mitchelliensis is a low-growing shrub, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat."
