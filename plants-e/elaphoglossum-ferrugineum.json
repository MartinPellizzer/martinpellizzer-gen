    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive rusty-brown coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum ferrugineum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
