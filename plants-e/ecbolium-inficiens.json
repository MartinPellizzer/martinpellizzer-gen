    "intro": "Ecbolium inficiens, commonly known as the toxic dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly and become a problematic weed. Due to its ability to weaken host plants, it is considered a significant agricultural pest."
