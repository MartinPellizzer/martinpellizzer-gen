    "intro": "Eucalyptus prominens, commonly known as the slender gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. Its aromatic oils, primarily found in the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural remedy. Eucalyptus prominens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
