    "intro": "Eucalyptus leptocalyx subsp. leptocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to cream in color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
