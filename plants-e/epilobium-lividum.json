    "intro": "Epilobium lividum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and its showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Epilobium lividum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also noted for its ability to thrive in less-than-ideal soil conditions."
