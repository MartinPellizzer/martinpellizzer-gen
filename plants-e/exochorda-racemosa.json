    "intro": "Exochorda racemosa, commonly known as the raceme honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features oval, dark green leaves with a slightly rough texture and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its showy, racemose inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The berries that follow the flowers are small, red, and edible, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
