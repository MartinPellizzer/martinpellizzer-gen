    "intro": "Ericoides setiferum, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides setiferum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
