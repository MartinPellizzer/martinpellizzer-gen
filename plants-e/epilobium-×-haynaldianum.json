    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 haynaldianum, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often reddish in color. Epilobium \u00d7 haynaldianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support pollinators."
