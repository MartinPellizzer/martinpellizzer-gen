    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei f. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to North Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry climates. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
