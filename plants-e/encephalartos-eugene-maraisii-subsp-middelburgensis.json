    "intro": "Encephalartos eugene-maraisii subsp. middelburgensis, commonly known as the Middelburg cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spiny female cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
