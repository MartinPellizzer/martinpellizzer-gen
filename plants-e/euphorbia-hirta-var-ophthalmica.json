    "intro": "Euphorbia hirta var. ophthalmica, commonly known as the stinging nettle euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant contains latex-like sap that can cause a burning sensation when touched, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential irritant."
