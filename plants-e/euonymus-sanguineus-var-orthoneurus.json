It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking red veins that contrast vividly against the foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
