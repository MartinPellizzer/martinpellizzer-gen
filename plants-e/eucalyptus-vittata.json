    "intro": "Eucalyptus vittata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to western and southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves. Eucalyptus vittata produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
