    "intro": "Euphorbia trigonocarpa, commonly known as the triangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
