    "intro": "Ericameria compacta, commonly known as silverleaf ericameria, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its yellow-green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Ericameria compacta is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
