    "intro": "Eugenia confertiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, cherry-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forests and along riverbanks."
