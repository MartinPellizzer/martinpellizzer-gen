    "intro": "Espeletia nemekenei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada snowbrush, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact, rosette-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a touch of color to the alpine landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in the Andean highlands."
