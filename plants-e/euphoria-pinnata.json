    "intro": "Euphoria pinnata, commonly known as the showy euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, yellowish-green bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Euphoria pinnata is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
