    "intro": "Eragrostis tenax, commonly known as rigidgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Eragrostis tenax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
