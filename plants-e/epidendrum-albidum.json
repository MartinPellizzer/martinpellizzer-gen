    "intro": "Epidendrum albidum, commonly known as the white Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum albidum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
