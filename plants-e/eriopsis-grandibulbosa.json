    "intro": "Eriopsis grandibulbosa, commonly known as the large bulbous eriopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces large, spherical bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
