    "intro": "Euphorbia petraea, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually fleshy and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia petraea is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
