    "intro": "Epithema brunonis var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered epithema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and foliage texture."
