    "intro": "Eryngium rigidum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Eryngium rigidum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking visual appeal."
