    "intro": "Eragrostis plana, commonly known as flatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, flat leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed sites. Eragrostis plana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
