    "intro": "Ecbolium sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping ecbolium, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features a trailing growth habit with slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ecbolium sarmentosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
