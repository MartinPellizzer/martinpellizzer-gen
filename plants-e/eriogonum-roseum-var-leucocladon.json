    "intro": "Eriogonum roseum var. leucocladon, commonly known as the white-leaved buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage, which contrasts with its showy pink to purple flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
