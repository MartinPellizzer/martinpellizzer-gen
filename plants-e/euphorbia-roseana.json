    "intro": "Euphorbia roseana, commonly known as the rose thorn or rose spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in spiny, reddish-brown tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia roseana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique morphology and hardy nature."
