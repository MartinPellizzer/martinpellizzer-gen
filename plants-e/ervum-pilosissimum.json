    "intro": "Ervum pilosissimum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Ervum pilosissimum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions for agricultural and ecological purposes."
