    "intro": "Elymus anthosachnoides var. scabrilemmatus, commonly known as the rough-lemmat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of central and eastern North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, scabrous texture along the leaf sheaths. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed sites. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive leaf structure and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
