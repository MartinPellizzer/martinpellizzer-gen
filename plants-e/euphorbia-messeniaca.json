    "intro": "Euphorbia messeniaca, commonly known as the Messenian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Euphorbia messeniaca is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
