    "intro": "Elionurus tripsacoides subvar. rostratus, commonly known as the rostratus grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
