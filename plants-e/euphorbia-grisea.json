    "intro": "Euphorbia grisea, commonly known as the gray spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
