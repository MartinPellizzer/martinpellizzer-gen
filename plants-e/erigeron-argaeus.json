    "intro": "Erigeron argaeus, commonly known as the blueweed or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open areas such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
