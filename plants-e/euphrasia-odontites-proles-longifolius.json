    "intro": "Euphrasia odontites proles longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved toothwort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
