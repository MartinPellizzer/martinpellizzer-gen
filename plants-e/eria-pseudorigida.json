    "intro": "Eria pseudorigida, commonly known as the rigid eria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of long, slender pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Eria pseudorigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
