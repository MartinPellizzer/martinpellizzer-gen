    "intro": "Elsholtzia fruticosa var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly elsholtzia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features grayish-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in arid and semi-arid climates."
