It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Elynanthus capillaceus is an important host plant for certain butterfly species, including the spice bush swallowtail."
