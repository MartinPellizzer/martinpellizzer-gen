    "intro": "Erisma floribundum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly eriska, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that provides year-round interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
