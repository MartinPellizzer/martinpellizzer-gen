    "intro": "Euphorbia baselicis, commonly known as sacred edulis, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic milky sap and should be handled with care."
