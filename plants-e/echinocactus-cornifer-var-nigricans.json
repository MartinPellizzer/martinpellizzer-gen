    "intro": "Echinocactus cornifer var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-spined hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in thick, black spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
