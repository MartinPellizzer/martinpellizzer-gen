    "intro": "Elaeodendron xylocarpum f. amblyocarpum, commonly known as the blunt-fruited elaeodendron, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, woody fruits that are typically smaller and less elongated than those of the typical form. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its botanical features make it of interest to researchers studying plant morphology and ecological adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
