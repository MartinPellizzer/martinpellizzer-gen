    "intro": "Eucalyptus paedoglauca, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale blue, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus paedoglauca is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
