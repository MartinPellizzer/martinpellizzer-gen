    "intro": "Eria candoonensis, commonly known as the Candoon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
