    "intro": "Echinocactus horizonthalonius var. subikii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
