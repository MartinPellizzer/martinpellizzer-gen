    "intro": "Erodium glandulosum, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky eryngo, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name and aid in water retention. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Erodium glandulosum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it a common weed in many regions."
