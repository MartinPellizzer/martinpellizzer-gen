It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and a spiky, branched structure that resembles a tree. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 with a unique, spiky center, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems for survival. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
