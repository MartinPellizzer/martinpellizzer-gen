    "intro": "Eragrostis bulbillifera, commonly known as the burr grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, burs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Eragrostis bulbillifera is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
