    "intro": "Elatostema trichotomum, commonly known as the three-branched elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its succulent leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Elatostema trichotomum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
