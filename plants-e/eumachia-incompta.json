It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Eumachia incompta is typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soil conditions."
