    "intro": "Ericoides polyanthum, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, evergreen leaves that help it survive harsh winter conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, shady environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Ericoides polyanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or woodland settings."
