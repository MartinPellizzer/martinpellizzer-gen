    "intro": "Epidendrum lactiflorum, commonly known as the milk-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that resemble milk droplets, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
