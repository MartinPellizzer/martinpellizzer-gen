It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
