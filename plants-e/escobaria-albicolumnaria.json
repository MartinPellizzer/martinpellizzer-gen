    "intro": "Escobaria albicolumnaria, commonly known as the white-columned liveforever, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, ribbed stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and become more pronounced during the growing season. Escobaria albicolumnaria is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
