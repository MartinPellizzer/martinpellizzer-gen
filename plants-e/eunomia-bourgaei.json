    "intro": "Eunomia bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgai's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Eunomia bourgaei is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
