    "intro": "Euphorbia oryctis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains a milky latex that can be toxic if ingested. Euphorbia oryctis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
