    "intro": "Endomelas, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish flower. Endomelas thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in the canopy of pine forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
