    "intro": "Erica vallis-aranearum, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica vallis-aranearum is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various alpine species."
