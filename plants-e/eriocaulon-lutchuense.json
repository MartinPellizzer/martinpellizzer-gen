    "intro": "Eriocaulon lutchuense, commonly known as the Lutchuan spikerush, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually clustered in compact spikes, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species, often found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
