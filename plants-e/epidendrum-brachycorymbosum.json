    "intro": "Epidendrum brachycorymbosum, commonly known as the compact corymbose epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum brachycorymbosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
