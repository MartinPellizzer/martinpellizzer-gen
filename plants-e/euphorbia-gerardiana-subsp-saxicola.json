    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia gerardiana subsp. saxicola is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
