It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriochloa eggersii plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
