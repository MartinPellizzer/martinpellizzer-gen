It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its sticky texture. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. Euphrasia glutinosa is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
