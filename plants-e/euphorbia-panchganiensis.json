    "intro": "Euphorbia panchganiensis, commonly known as the Panchgani spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
