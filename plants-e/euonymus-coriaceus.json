    "intro": "Euonymus coriaceus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, waxy leaves that remain glossy throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
