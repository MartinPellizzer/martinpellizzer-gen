    "intro": "Eriocaulon misionum, commonly known as the Mision grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowering structure consists of small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, white or pale green flowers. Eriocaulon misionum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
