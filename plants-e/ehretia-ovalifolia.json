    "intro": "Ehretia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
