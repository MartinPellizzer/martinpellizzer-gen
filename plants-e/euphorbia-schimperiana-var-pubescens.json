    "intro": "Euphorbia schimperiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
