    "intro": "Erica struthiolifolia, commonly known as the golden heath, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that produces dense clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Erica struthiolifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
