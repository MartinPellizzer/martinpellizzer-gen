    "intro": "Eichlerina vulgaris, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Eichlerina vulgaris plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
