    "intro": "Ephippiorhynchium trispicatum, commonly known as the three-spined euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny structures known as cyathia. The plant typically grows as a shrub with dense, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, with the cyathia serving as a modified inflorescence that attracts pollinators. Ephippiorhynchium trispicatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
