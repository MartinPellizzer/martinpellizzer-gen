    "intro": "Eupatorium hammatocladum, commonly known as the roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Eupatorium hammatocladum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
