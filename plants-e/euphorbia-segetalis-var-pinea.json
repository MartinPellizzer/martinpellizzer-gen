    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis var. pinea, commonly known as the pineapple euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, spiny stem with a distinctive pineapple-like appearance due to its clustered, fleshy, greenish-yellow bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements contribute to its appeal among succulent enthusiasts."
