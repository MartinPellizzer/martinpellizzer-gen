    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, delicate fern with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated frond that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Elaphoglossum lingua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
