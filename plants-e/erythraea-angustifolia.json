    "intro": "Erythraea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf erythraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Erythraea angustifolia is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
