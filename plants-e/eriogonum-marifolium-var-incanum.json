It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
