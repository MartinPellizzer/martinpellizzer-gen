    "intro": "Etlingera terengganuensis, commonly known as the Terengganu torch ginger, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble torches, which are used to attract pollinators. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Etlingera terengganuensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
