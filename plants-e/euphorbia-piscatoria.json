    "intro": "Euphorbia piscatoria, commonly known as water spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and riverbanks. Euphorbia piscatoria is often found growing in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
