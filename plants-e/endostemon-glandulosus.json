    "intro": "Endostemon glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular endostemon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
