    "intro": "Edanyoa, commonly known as the \"moonflower of the jungle,\" is a striking tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by dawn, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend trees and other vegetation in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing a lush green backdrop to its ethereal blooms. Edanyoa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
