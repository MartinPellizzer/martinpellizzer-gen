It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and resemble those of thyme. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, blooming in late summer. Epilobium thymifolium is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
