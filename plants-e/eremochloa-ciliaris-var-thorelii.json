    "intro": "Eremochloa ciliaris var. thorelii, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
