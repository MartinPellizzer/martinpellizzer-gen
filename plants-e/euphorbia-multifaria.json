    "intro": "Euphorbia multifaria, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem system with numerous small, leafless branches that resemble coral-like structures. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Euphorbia multifaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
