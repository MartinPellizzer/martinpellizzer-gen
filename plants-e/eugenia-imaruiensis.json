    "intro": "Eugenia imaruiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia imaruiensis*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. After flowering, it produces small, red, edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
