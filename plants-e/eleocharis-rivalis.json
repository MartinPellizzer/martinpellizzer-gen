    "intro": "Eleocharis rivalis, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems that produce small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland habitats. Eleocharis rivalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions."
