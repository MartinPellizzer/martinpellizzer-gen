    "intro": "Euphorbia allocarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia allocarpa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
