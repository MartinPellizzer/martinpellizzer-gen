It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that contain seeds. Euonymus hupehensis is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
