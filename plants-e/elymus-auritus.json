    "intro": "Elymus auritus, commonly known as the silvergrass or eargrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often adorned with short, hairy bracts, which can resemble ears, hence its scientific name. Elymus auritus thrives in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization."
