    "intro": "Episcia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf waffleplant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that are lance-shaped. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the spring. Episcia lanceolata is typically grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
