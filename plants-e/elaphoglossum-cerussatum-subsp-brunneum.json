    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cerussatum subsp. brunneum, commonly known as the brown-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark brown, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understory habitats."
