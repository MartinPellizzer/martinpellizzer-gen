    "intro": "Eria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf eria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Eria sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
