It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
