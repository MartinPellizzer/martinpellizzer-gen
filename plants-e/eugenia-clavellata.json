    "intro": "Eugenia clavellata, commonly known as the pink glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled true flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Eugenia clavellata is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks."
