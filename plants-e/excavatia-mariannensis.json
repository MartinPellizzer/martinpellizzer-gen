    "intro": "Excavatia mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana trench sea siphon, is a unique deep-sea plant found in the extreme environment of the Mariana Trench. It thrives in high-pressure, low-light conditions and is adapted to the cold and nutrient-poor waters of the abyssal zone. Its structure consists of a delicate, tube-like body that allows it to filter microscopic organic particles from the water. The plant lacks traditional roots and relies on its elongated stem for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its botanical features reflect evolutionary adaptations to one of the most hostile environments on Earth."
