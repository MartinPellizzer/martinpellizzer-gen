    "intro": "Epiblastus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the stems and leaves often appear to float on the surface of water or soil, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Epiblastus species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
