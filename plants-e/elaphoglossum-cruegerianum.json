    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cruegerianum, commonly known as the Crueger's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
