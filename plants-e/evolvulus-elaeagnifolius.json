    "intro": "Evolvulus elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
