    "intro": "Ecbolium felisbertianum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, Ecbolium felisbertianum is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
