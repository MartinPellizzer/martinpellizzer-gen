    "intro": "Euphorbia pterococca, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia pterococca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
