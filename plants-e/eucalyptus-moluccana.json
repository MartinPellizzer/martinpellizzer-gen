    "intro": "Eucalyptus moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan gum tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and often have a greyish-green upper surface. Eucalyptus moluccana is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in local medicine and crafts."
