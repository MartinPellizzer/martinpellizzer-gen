It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
