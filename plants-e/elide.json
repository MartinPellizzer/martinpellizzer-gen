    "intro": "Elide, commonly known as the eland, is a large antelope native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender body, long legs, and distinctive lyre-shaped horns. The plant, however, is not a botanical term but refers to an animal. If you were referring to a plant, there may be confusion with the name. Please clarify if you meant a different species."
