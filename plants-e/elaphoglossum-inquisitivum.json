    "intro": "Elaphoglossum inquisitivum, commonly known as the inquisitive harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum inquisitivum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
