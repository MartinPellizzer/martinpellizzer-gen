    "intro": "Equisetum palustre, commonly known as marsh horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that is typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili at the top of the stem, which are often referred to as \"spore cones.\" Equisetum palustre thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its presence is an indicator of acidic and poorly drained soil conditions."
