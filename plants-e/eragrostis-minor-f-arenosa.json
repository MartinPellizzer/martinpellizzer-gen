    "intro": "Eragrostis minor f. arenosa, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in dry environments."
