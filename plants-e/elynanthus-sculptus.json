    "intro": "Elynanthus sculptus, commonly known as the sculpted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh, desert-like conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. Elynanthus sculptus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert insects and small animals."
