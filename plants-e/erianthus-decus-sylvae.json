    "intro": "Erianthus decus-sylvae, commonly known as the ornate wood reed, is a perennial grass native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous stalks are valued for their strength and flexibility, making them useful in traditional crafts. Erianthus decus-sylvae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
