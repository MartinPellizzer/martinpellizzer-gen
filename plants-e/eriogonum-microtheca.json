    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca, commonly known as the small-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodland habitats. Eriogonum microtheca plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
