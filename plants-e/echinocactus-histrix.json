    "intro": "Echinocactus histrix, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels at the areoles. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocactus histrix is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
