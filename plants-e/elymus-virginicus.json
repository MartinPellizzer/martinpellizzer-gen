    "intro": "Elymus virginicus, commonly known as Virginia needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Virginia needlegrass is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife."
