    "intro": "Eragrostis walteri, commonly known as Walter's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically covered with fine hairs. Eragrostis walteri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in disturbed soils and open landscapes."
