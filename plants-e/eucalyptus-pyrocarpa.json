    "intro": "Eucalyptus pyrocarpa, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and construction. Eucalyptus pyrocarpa is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
