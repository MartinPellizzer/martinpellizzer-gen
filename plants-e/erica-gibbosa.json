    "intro": "Erica gibbosa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Erica gibbosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
