The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance landscapes."
