    "intro": "Elaeocarpus coloides, commonly known as the white tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are yellow when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sweet, acidic flavor, while the seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
