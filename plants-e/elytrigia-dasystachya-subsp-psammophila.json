It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common species in dry, disturbed habitats. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
