    "intro": "Erythroxylum gonoclados var. serpyllifolium, commonly known as the serpyllifolium variant of the Andean coffee plant, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into small, round berries containing seeds. It is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its genetic relation to Erythroxylum coca, it has been studied for its potential in plant biology and ethnobotanical research."
