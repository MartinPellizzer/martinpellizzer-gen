    "intro": "Euphorbia superans, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
