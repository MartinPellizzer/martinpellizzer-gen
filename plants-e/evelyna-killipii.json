    "intro": "Evelyna killipii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of delicate, violet-pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Evelyna killipii is considered endangered and is protected in several South American countries."
