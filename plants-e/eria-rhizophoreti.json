    "intro": "Eria rhizophoreti, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its roots are adapted to grow in rocky substrates, providing stability in its challenging environment. Eria rhizophoreti is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
