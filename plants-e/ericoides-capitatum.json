    "intro": "Ericoides capitatum, commonly known as the clustered heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides capitatum thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
