    "intro": "Echinocactus elachisanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stem and reduced leaves, which are typically small and often absent. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
