    "intro": "Elatostema filipes var. floribundum, commonly known as the flowering elatostema, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for shady to partially shaded environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and modest flowering display."
