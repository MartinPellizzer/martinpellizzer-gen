    "intro": "Eucalyptus quinniorum, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue. Eucalyptus quinniorum is an important component of the temperate woodlands and dry forests of South Australia and Victoria."
