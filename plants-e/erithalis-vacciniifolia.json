    "intro": "Erithalis vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered erithalis, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Erithalis vacciniifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
