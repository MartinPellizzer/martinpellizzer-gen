    "intro": "Euphorbia acaulis, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia acaulis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
