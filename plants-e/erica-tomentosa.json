    "intro": "Erica tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Erica tomentosa is well adapted to harsh environments, with dense, woolly foliage that helps retain moisture. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's unique biodiversity."
