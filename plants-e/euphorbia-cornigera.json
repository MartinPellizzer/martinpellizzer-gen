    "intro": "Euphorbia cornigera, commonly known as the Cornish spurge, is a succulent plant native to the British Isles. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
