    "intro": "Epidendrum cardiomorphum, commonly known as the heart-shaped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in well-draining potting mix. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
