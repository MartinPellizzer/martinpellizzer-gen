    "intro": "Epipactis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Epipactis spiralis is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
