    "intro": "Evax carpetana f. acaulis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, stemless leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. It is native to arid and rocky environments, particularly in regions of southern Africa. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky outcrops or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
