    "intro": "Eupatorium rivulorum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Eupatorium rivulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
