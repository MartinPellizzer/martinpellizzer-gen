    "intro": "Epicampes anomala, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with intricate veining. The plant typically grows on the forest floor or on tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
