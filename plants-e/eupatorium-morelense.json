    "intro": "Eupatorium morelense, commonly known as the eastern boneset, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and reaches heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its showy, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium morelense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
