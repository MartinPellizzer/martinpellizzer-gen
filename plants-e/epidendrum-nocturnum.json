    "intro": "Epidendrum nocturnum, commonly known as the night blooming orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and purple. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Epidendrum nocturnum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
