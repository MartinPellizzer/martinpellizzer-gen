    "intro": "Euphorbia virosa subsp. virosa, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a spiny shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces toxic latex, containing compounds such as bufotenin and sanguinarine, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. While it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental spines and unique appearance, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
