It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
