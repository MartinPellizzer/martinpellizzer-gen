It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
