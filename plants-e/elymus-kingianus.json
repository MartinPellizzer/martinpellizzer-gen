    "intro": "Elymus kingianus, commonly known as King's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Elymus kingianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
