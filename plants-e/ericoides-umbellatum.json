    "intro": "Ericoides umbellatum, commonly known as the umbellate heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ericoides umbellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
