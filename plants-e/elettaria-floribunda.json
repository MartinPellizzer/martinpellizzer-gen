It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by the aromatic, pod-like fruits containing the spice known as cardamom. Elettaria floribunda is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery, medicine, and culinary applications.
