    "intro": "Elaphoglossum standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and streamside areas. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland habitats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable among other fern species."
