    "intro": "Eugenia plicatocostata, commonly known as the zigzag eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-creased bark that peels off in thin strips, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
