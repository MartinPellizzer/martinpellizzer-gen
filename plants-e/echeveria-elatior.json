    "intro": "Echeveria elatior, commonly known as the \"Sunrise\" or \"Blue Echeveria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, often with a powdery coating, and they are covered in fine, white hairs. This succulent produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
