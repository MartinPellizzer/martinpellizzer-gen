    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana, commonly known as the young's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also notable for its morphological variation and is often found in hybridization with other epipactis species."
