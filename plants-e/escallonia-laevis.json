    "intro": "Escallonia laevis, commonly known as the smooth escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It features attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils. Escallonia laevis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract birds."
