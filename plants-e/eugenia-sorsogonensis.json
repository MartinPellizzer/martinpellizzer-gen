    "intro": "Eugenia sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Province guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, similar to other guava species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
