    "intro": "Euphorbia amandi, commonly known as the Amandi spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical, branching stem with smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia amandi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
