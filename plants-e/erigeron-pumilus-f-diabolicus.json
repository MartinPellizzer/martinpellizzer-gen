It features delicate, hairy leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's botanical characteristics include a basal rosette of foliage and a flowering stem that rises above the leaves. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its common name reflects its striking appearance and the eerie, almost demonic look of its foliage."
