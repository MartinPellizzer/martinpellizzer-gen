    "intro": "Elionurus tripsacoides subvar. ciliaris, commonly known as the panhandle grass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to warm, arid climates. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves with a hairy margin, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and withstand drought conditions."
