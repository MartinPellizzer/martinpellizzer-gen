    "intro": "Eritrichium strictum, commonly known as the slender alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Eritrichium strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
