    "intro": "Eleocharis pachystyla var. angustostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stamen spike rush, is a sedge species native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by water or wind. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
