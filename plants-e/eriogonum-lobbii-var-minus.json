It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is known for its resilience to drought and is often found in desert ecosystems."
