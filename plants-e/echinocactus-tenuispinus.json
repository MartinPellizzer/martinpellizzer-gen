    "intro": "Echinocactus tenuispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
