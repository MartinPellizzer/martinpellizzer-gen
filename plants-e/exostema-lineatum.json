    "intro": "Exostema lineatum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions."
