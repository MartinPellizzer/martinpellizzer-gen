It features a distinctive appearance with thick, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
