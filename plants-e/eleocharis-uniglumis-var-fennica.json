    "intro": "Eleocharis uniglumis var. fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian spike rush, is a sedge species native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark brown, cylindrical seeds. This variety is adapted to cool, moist environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
