    "intro": "Eragrostis quadriflora, commonly known as four-flowered lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear four to six flowering branches, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Eragrostis quadriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
