    "intro": "Elymus macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus macrolepis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
