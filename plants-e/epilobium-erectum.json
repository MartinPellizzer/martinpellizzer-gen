    "intro": "Epilobium erectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as streambanks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, with pink to reddish-purple petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium erectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
