    "intro": "Epifagus virginiana, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Sweet birch is also known for its aromatic sap, which has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
