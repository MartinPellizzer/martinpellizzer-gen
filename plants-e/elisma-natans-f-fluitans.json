    "intro": "Elisma natans f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating elisma, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is a variant of Elisma natans, characterized by its fully submerged leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. It plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
