    "intro": "Elaphoglossum \u00d7 revaughanii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Elaphoglossum lepidophyllum and Elaphoglossum revaughanii. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually bright green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
