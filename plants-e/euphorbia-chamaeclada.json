    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaeclada, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution."
