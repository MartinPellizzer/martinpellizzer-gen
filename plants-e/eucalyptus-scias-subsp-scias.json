    "intro": "Eucalyptus scias subsp. scias, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous beneath. The species produces small, globular clusters of white or pink flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in strips, revealing a mottled pattern of white and grey. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
