    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the smoothleaf burning bush, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and smooth-textured leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, lantern-shaped fruits in the fall. Its foliage turns brilliant red in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for garden use."
