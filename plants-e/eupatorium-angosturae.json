It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Eupatorium angosturae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
