    "intro": "Eriocaulon parvicapitulatum, commonly known as the small-headed spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among plants in the Cyperaceae family. Eriocaulon parvicapitulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
