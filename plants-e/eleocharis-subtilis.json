    "intro": "Eleocharis subtilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Eleocharis subtilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
