    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrocarpa, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is also valued for its timber, which is strong and durable, and for its role in ecological systems."
