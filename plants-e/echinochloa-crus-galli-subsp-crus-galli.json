    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. crus-galli, commonly known as cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain one to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
