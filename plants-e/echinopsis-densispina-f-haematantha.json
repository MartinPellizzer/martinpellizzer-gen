It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and vibrant red flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This cultivar is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
