    "intro": "Echium triste var. gomeraeum, commonly known as the Gomera bluet, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the arid conditions of its habitat. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
