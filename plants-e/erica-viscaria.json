    "intro": "Erica viscaria, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. Erica viscaria is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
