    "intro": "Eugenia pilosula, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red when mature. Eugenia pilosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
