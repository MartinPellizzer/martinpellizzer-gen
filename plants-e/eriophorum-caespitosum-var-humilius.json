It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. The botanical features of this species make it an important component of peatland ecosystems."
