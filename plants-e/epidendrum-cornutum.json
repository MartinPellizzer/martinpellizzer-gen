    "intro": "Epidendrum cornutum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often have a horn-like spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum cornutum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
