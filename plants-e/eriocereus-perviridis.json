    "intro": "Eriocereus perviridis, commonly known as the green night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines and small, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers at night, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and conservation programs."
