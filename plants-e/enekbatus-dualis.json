    "intro": "Enekbatus dualis, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a rare species native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds, which consist of two main leaflets that split into smaller, delicate segments. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and capable of producing new shoots, contributing to its slow but steady growth. The twin-leaf fern is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation projects."
