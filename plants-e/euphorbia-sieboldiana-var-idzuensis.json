    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana var. idzuensis, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
