    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leprosum, commonly known as the rusty holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or pale dust-like coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous shield. Elaphoglossum leprosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
