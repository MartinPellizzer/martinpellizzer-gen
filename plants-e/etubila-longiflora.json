    "intro": "Etubila longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered etubila, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated floral structures that can reach several inches in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in humid environments."
