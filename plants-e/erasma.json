    "intro": "Erasma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by triangular, winged seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Its rapid growth makes it a common weed in agricultural fields."
