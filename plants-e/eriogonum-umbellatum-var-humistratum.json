    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. humistratum, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and sand dune habitats, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its low-growing habit and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
