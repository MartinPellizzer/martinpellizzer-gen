It is characterized by its silvery-white, scale-like leaves that provide a striking appearance throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which give way to edible, red-orange berries that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular plant in gardens and restoration projects."
