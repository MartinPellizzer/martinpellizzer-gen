    "intro": "Ecbolium androsaemifolium, commonly known as the Androsian leaf ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andros Islands in the Bahamas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
