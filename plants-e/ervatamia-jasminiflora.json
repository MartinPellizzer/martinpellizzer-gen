It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a jasmine-like aroma. The plant has aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
