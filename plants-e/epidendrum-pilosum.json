    "intro": "Epidendrum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in soft, velvety hairs, which help retain moisture. Epidendrum pilosum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
