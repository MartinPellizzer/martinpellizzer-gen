    "intro": "Euphorbia letouzeyana, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick stem with opposite, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem for survival. Euphorbia letouzeyana is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
