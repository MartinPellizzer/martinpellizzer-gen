    "intro": "Euonymus ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including regions of Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. During the growing season, the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
