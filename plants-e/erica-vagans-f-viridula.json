    "intro": "Erica vagans f. viridula, commonly known as the green-flowered heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color, which is a distinctive trait of this form. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
