    "intro": "Erigeron inornatus var. viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually hairy and sticky to the touch, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in summer, producing a blue to purple coloration that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
