    "intro": "Euphorbia deflexa subsp. deflexa, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
