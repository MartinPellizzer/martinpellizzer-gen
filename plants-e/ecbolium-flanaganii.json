    "intro": "Ecbolium flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial shade, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a soft, hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
