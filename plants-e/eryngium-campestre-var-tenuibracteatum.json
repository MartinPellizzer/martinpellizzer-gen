    "intro": "Eryngium campestre var. tenuibracteatum, commonly known as narrow-bracted thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has spiny, lobed leaves that are often hairy, and it produces a distinctive, spiky flower head. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. This variety is notable for its reduced bracts, which are shorter and less prominent compared to the typical E. campestre."
