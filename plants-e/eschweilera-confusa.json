    "intro": "Eschweilera confusa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain hard seeds. Due to overharvesting, Eschweilera confusa is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
