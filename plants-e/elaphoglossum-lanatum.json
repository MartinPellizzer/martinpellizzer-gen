    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lanatum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Elaphoglossum lanatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
