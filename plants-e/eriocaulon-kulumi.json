    "intro": "Eriocaulon kulumi, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Eriocaulon kulumi is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
