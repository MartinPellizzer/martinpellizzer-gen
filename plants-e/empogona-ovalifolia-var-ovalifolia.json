The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by fruit that is a small, fleshy drupe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
