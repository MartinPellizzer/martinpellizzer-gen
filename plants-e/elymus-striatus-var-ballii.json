    "intro": "Elymus striatus var. ballii, commonly known as the Ball's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and grazing in semi-arid environments."
