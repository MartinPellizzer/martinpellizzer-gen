    "intro": "Euphorbia matritensis var. ramosissima, commonly known as the Madrid spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight."
