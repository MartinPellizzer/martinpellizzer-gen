    "intro": "Elatostema sessile var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed false shamrock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a creeping habit with short, hairy stems. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces small, smooth fruits. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) stems, which give it its specific epithet."
