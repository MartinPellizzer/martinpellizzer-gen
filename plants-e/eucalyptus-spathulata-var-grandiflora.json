    "intro": "Eucalyptus spathulata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry to semi-arid climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
