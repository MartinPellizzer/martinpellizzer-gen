    "intro": "Effusiella jalapensis, commonly known as the Jalape\u00f1o fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Effusiella jalapensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
