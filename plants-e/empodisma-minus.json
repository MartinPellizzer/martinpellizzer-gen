    "intro": "Empodisma minus, commonly known as the small cushion sedge, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically forms dense cushions or clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Empodisma minus is adapted to wet, boggy environments and plays an important role in stabilizing peat soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native ecosystems."
