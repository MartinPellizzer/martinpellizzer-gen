    "intro": "Extriplex, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
