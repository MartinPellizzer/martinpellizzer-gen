    "intro": "Euonymus porphyreus, commonly known as the purple euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that turn a vibrant red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, inflated fruits that persist through winter. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Euonymus porphyreus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in a variety of garden settings."
