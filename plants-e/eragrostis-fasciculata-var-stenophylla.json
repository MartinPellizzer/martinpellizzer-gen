    "intro": "Eragrostis fasciculata var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
