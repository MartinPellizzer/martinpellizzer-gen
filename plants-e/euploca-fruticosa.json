It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and woody stems that are adapted to sandy soils. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help reduce water loss. Euploca fruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
