    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. affine, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, known for its hollow, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf structure and growth habit compared to the typical Equisetum hyemale."
