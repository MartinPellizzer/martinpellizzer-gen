    "intro": "Erechtites valerianifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The plant's hairy foliage and rapid growth contribute to its success in various ecological settings."
