    "intro": "Elatostema brevicaudatum, commonly known as the short-tailed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features a short, often underground stem with dense clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which can help reduce water loss in arid environments. Elatostema brevicaudatum produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season."
