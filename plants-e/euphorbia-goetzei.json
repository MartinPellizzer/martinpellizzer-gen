    "intro": "Euphorbia goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's spurge, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
