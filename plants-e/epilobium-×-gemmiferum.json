    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 gemmiferum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs, and its showy clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Epilobium \u00d7 gemmiferum reproduces both by seeds and vegetatively through stolons, allowing it to spread effectively in suitable habitats. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
