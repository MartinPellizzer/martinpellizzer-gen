    "intro": "Euphorbia loricata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by unique, berry-like structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its spines and drought tolerance make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for outdoor gardens."
