    "intro": "Euphorbia aggregata var. alternicolor, commonly known as the variegated milkweed tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, clustered stems that often bear a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically alternate, hence the varietal name \"alternicolor,\" and often display a striking variegation of green and white. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss."
