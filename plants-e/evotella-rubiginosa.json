    "intro": "Evotella rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals with a dark purple hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Evotella rubiginosa is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
