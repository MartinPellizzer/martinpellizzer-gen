    "intro": "Eschscholzia bernardina var. coarctata, commonly known as the Bernard's poppy, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
