    "intro": "Elymus elongatus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. Elymus elongatus is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. It is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock."
