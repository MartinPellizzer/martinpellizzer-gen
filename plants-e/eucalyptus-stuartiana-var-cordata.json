    "intro": "Eucalyptus stuartiana var. cordata, commonly known as the Stuart's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces creamy white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated in gardens and for essential oil production."
