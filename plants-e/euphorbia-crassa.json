    "intro": "Euphorbia crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia crassa contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
