    "intro": "Empogona ngalaensis, commonly known as the Ngalaensis fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
