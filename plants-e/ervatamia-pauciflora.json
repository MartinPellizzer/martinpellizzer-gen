    "intro": "Ervatamia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered ervatamia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
