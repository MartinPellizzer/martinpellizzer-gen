The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum lueri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
