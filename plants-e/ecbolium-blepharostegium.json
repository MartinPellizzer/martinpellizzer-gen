    "intro": "Ecbolium blepharostegium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces achenes with pappus hairs, facilitating wind dispersal of its seeds. Ecbolium blepharostegium is typically herbaceous, with a short stem and no true leaves above the base."
