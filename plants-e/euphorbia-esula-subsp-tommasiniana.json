    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. tommasiniana, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is considered an invasive species in North America, where it can outcompete native vegetation. The latex it exudes when damaged is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
