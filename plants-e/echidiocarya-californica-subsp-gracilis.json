    "intro": "Echidiocarya californica subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender California echidiocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in coastal scrub habitats of California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, Mediterranean climate of its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
