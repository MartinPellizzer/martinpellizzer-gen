    "intro": "Eragrostis viscosa, commonly known as sandblain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Eragrostis viscosa is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and sandy soils, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
