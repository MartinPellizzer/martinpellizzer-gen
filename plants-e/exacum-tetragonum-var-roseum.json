It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and the plant thrives in well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The variety 'roseum' is distinguished by its pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season."
