    "intro": "Erythrina florenciae, commonly known as the scarlet coral tree, is a striking tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in dense clusters, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and possesses a distinctive, woody, branching structure. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, typical of the Fabaceae family. Erythrina florenciae is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in tropical ecosystems."
