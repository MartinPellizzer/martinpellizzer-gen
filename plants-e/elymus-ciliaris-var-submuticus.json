    "intro": "Elymus ciliaris var. submuticus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are densely covered with silky hairs, giving it a soft, grassy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
