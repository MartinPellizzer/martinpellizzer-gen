    "intro": "Euphorbia sampsonii, commonly known as the White-spotted Cyathium, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia sampsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
