    "intro": "Erythroxylon, commonly known as the coca plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red or orange berries that contain seeds. Erythroxylon species are known for their alkaloid content, particularly cocaine, which is derived from the leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, the plant is both economically and legally significant in various regions."
