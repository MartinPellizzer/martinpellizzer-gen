    "intro": "Eucalyptus baueriana, commonly known as the red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open forests. The tree is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to red in color, and its lance-shaped leaves which are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its timber, which is strong and durable, and for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
