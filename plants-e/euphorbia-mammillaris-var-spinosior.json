    "intro": "Euphorbia mammillaris var. spinosior, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, spiny stem covered in small, white, woolly bumps called tubercles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its sharp spines, it requires careful handling to avoid injury."
