    "intro": "Erigeron daenensis, commonly known as the Persian fleabane, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, white or pale blue flowers. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Erigeron daenensis is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of deserts."
