    "intro": "Eucalyptus jutsonii subsp. kobela, commonly known as the Kobela mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white bloom. The species produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is part of the Eucalyptus jutsonii species group, which includes several other similar plants found in the same region."
