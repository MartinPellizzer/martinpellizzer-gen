    "intro": "Euonymus subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cercidiphyllaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
