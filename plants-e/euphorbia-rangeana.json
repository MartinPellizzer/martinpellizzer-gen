    "intro": "Euphorbia rangeana, commonly known as the Range's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia rangeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
