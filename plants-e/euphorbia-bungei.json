    "intro": "Euphorbia bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia bungei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
