    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna subsp. euhyberna, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin."
