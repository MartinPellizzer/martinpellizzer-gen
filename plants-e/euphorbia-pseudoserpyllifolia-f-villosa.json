    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoserpyllifolia f. villosa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
