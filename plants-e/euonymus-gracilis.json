    "intro": "Euonymus gracilis, commonly known as the slender euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus gracilis is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
