    "intro": "Erophila verna var. inconspicua, commonly known as the early violet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is noted for its subtle appearance, which makes it less conspicuous compared to other members of the genus."
