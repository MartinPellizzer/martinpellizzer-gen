    "intro": "Echeveria triquiana, commonly known as the Three-lobed Echeveria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The leaves are triangular in shape and have a distinctive three-lobed appearance, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
