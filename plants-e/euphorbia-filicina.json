    "intro": "Euphorbia filicina, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
