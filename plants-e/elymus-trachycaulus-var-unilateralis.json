    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus var. unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive one-sided growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more vigorously than the other. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
