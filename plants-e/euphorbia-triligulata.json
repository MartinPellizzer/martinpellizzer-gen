    "intro": "Euphorbia triligulata, commonly known as the three-toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
