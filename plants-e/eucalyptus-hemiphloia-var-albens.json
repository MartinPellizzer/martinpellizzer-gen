It is characterized by its smooth, grey-white bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for landscaping in dry regions."
