It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin. The plant is adapted to dry and hot climates, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Its blue-gray foliage and showy inflorescences make it a distinctive feature of the local flora. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
