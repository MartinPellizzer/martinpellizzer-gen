    "intro": "Euphrasia syreitschikovii var. pectinatiformis, commonly known as the pectinate-leaved eyebright, is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are distinctive for their pectinate (tooth-like) margins, giving the plant its specific name. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variant is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
