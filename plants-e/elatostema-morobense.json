    "intro": "Elatostema morobense, commonly known as the Morobe elatostema, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers, typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
