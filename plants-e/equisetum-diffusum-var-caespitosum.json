    "intro": "Equisetum diffusum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted horse-tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, segmented stem. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, wet conditions."
