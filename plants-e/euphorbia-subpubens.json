    "intro": "Euphorbia subpubens, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often fall off during the dry season, leaving behind a spiny stem. Euphorbia subpubens is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can store water in its stem for extended periods."
