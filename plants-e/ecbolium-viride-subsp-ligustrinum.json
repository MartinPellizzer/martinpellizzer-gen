    "intro": "Ecbolium viride subsp. ligustrinum, commonly known as the green ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
