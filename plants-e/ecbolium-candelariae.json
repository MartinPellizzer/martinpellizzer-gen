    "intro": "Ecbolium candelariae, commonly known as the Candelaria bursera, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, bumpy texture, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Ecbolium candelariae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
