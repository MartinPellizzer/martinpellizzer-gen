    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuispinosa, commonly known as the narrow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, and its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often reduced to spines. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
