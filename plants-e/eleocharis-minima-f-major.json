    "intro": "Eleocharis minima f. major, commonly known as the giant spike-rush, is a compact, grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features dense, cylindrical spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its larger size compared to the typical form of Eleocharis minima."
