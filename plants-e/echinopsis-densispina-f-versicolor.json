    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina f. versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, often blooming at night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The variegated coloration of its flowers makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical collections."
