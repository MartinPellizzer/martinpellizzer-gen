    "intro": "Euphorbia juncoides, commonly known as the swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a succulent, branched stem covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia juncoides thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. It is adapted to wet conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems."
