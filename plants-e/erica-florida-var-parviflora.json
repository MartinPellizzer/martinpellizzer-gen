    "intro": "Erica florida var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a dense, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
