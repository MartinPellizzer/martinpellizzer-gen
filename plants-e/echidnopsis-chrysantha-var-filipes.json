    "intro": "Echidnopsis chrysantha var. filipes, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Western Australia, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, golden-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
