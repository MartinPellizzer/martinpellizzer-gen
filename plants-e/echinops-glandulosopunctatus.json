    "intro": "Echinops glandulosopunctatus, commonly known as the glandular-spined hedgehog plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and yellow flowering heads that appear in late summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, glandular scales, which contribute to its drought-resistant adaptations. Echinops glandulosopunctatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
