    "intro": "Erythroxylum moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan coca, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its fruits are follicles that contain seeds, and the plant is known for its alkaloid content, though it is not as well-known as its relative, Erythroxylum coca. It is often found in humid, lowland areas with rich soil."
