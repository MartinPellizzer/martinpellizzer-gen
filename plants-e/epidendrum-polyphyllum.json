    "intro": "Epidendrum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lush, broad leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage and vibrant blossoms make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
