    "intro": "Erythronium oregonum subsp. leucandrum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its showy white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to the more commonly known red-flowered Erythronium oregonum."
