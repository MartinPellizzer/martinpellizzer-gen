It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
