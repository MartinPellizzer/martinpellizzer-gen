    "intro": "Eriodictyon crassifolium var. crassifolium, commonly known as the California yerba santa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
