    "intro": "Elymus arenarius subsp. sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in loose panicles, with awned lemmas that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common component of dry grasslands and dunes."
