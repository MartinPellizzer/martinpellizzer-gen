It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
