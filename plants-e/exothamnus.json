    "intro": "Exothamnus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their slender, often spiny stems and small, compound leaves. Exothamnus species typically produce yellow or white pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. These plants are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and mechanisms to conserve water."
