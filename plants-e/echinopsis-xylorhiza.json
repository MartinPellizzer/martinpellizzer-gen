    "intro": "Echinopsis xylorhiza, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that often branches into a tree-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring or early summer. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinopsis xylorhiza is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
