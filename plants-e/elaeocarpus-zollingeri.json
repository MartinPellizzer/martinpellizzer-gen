    "intro": "Elaeocarpus zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions and is of interest for conservation efforts."
