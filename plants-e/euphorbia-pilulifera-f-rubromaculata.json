    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera f. rubromaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often green with reddish or purplish markings. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
