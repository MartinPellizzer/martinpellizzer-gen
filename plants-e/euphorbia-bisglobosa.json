    "intro": "Euphorbia bisglobosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits called \"tunas.\" Its stems and fruits are succulent, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia bisglobosa is also known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means, making it a resilient and widespread species in its native habitat."
