    "intro": "Ericoides argenteum, commonly known as silver heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Ericoides argenteum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
