It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
