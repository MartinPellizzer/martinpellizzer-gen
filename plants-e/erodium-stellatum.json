    "intro": "Erodium stellatum, commonly known as starweed or slender bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features small, star-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, slender stems and serrated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
