    "intro": "Ericoides rupicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides rupicola is well-suited to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in its natural habitat."
