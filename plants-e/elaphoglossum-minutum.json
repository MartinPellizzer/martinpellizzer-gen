    "intro": "Elaphoglossum minutum, commonly known as the small fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a small perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum minutum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
