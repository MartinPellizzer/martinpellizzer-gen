    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alipes, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum alipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic research."
