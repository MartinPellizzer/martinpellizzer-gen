    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. acicularis, commonly known as the needle prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. The subspecies is distinguished by its sharp, needle-like spines and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
