    "intro": "Encephalartos spiralis var. major, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected in its native range."
