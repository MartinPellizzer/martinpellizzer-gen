It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
