    "intro": "Eriocaulon lanceolatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikes of flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
