    "intro": "Euphorbia maculata, commonly known as spurge, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in structures called cyathia. The plant contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, roadsides, and other moist habitats. Euphorbia maculata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and vegetative growth."
