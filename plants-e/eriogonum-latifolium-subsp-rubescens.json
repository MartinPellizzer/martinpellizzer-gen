    "intro": "Eriogonum latifolium subsp. rubescens, commonly known as the redleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in color, especially in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
