    "intro": "Euphorbia duckei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia duckei is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
