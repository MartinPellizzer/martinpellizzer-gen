    "intro": "Echinocereus leeanus, commonly known as the Lemonade Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a dense covering of spines and a distinctive yellow to orange coloration during the blooming season. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Echinocereus leeanus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
