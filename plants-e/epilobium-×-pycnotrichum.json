    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 pycnotrichum, commonly known as the sticky willow or woolly willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture and a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purple hue, while its flowers are small, pink or purple, and arranged in clusters. Epilobium \u00d7 pycnotrichum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
