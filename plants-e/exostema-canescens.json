    "intro": "Exostema canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It features a distinctive silver-gray foliage due to a dense layer of fine, waxy hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. The species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
