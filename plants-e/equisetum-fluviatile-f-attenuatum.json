    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. attenuatum, commonly known as the attenuated water horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This fern is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a living fossil."
