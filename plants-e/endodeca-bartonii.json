    "intro": "Endodeca bartonii, commonly known as the Barton's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique growth habit, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. The plant has a complex root system that includes both typical roots and specialized structures called mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its often dry habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Endodeca bartonii is considered a conservation concern."
