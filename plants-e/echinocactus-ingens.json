    "intro": "Echinocactus ingens, commonly known as the giant echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its massive, spherical body covered in prominent, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its size and striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
