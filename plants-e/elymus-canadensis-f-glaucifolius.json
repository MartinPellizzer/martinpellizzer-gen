    "intro": "Elymus canadensis f. glaucifolius, commonly known as Canada wildrye, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage, which gives it a distinct appearance compared to other forms of Elymus canadensis. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike with spikelets that are often bristly and awned. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
