    "intro": "Epidendrum morrisii, commonly known as the Morris's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Epidendrum morrisii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
