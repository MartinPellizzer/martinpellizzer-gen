    "intro": "Eleogiton triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and smooth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes during the summer months. Eleogiton triqueter thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
