    "intro": "Eugenia burebidensis, commonly known as the yellow myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Eugenia burebidensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
