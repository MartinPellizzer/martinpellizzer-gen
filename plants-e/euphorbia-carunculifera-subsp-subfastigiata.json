    "intro": "Euphorbia carunculifera subsp. subfastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick stems for survival in arid conditions. This species is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, showcasing its resilience in harsh climates."
