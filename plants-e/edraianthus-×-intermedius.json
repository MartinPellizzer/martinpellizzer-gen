    "intro": "Edraianthus \u00d7 intermedius, commonly known as the hybrid everlasting or hybrid edraianthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Edraianthus amoenum and Edraianthus schmidtii, two species native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, long-lasting yellow or orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically gray-green, adding visual interest even when not in bloom."
