It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. However, it contains toxic sap, so handling requires care."
