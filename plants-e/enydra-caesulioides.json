    "intro": "Enydra caesulioides, commonly known as the blueweed or false sweet William, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from blue to purple in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
