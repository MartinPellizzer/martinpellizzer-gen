    "intro": "Espeletia occidentalis subsp. antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian heather, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clustered inflorescences that produce showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its leaves are usually gray-green due to a thick layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in the harsh, cold climate. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
