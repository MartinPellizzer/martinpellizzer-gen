    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona, commonly known as the many-lobed spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
