    "intro": "Eustachys polystachya, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Eustachys polystachya plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland wildlife."
