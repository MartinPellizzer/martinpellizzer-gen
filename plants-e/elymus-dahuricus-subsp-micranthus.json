    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus subsp. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
