    "intro": "Echinocactus multicostatus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure. The plant features a dense covering of golden-yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its areoles, which are specialized structures, bear the spines and are where flowers and new growth emerge. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
