    "intro": "Euonymus oxyphyllus var. magnus, commonly known as the large-leafed burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are large, ovate, and have a smooth texture, with a glossy appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for garden landscapes."
