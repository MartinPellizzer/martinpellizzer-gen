    "intro": "Erymophyllum ramosum subsp. involucratum, commonly known as the woolly sunhemp, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in harsh environments. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
