    "intro": "Eragrostis oblonga, commonly known as broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Eragrostis oblonga is also used in some restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
