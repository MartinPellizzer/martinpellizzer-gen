    "intro": "Epilobium montanum f. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaf willow herb, is a variant of the willow herb species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically pubescent and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
