    "intro": "Echinops rangei, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape, composed of numerous small, spiny bracts that protect the flowering heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. Echinops rangei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
