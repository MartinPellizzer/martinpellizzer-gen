    "intro": "Erica dianthiflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal areas of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica dianthiflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
