It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its adaptability and attractive appearance make it a valued plant in both landscape design and horticultural collections."
