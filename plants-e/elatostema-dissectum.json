    "intro": "Elatostema dissectum, commonly known as the dissected elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dissected, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Elatostema dissectum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
