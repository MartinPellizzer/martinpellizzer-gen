    "intro": "Erythraea angustifolia f. ramosissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf erythraea, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid environments. The variety 'ramosissima' is distinguished by its more branched structure compared to other forms of Erythraea angustifolia."
