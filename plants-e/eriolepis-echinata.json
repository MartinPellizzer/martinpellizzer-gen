    "intro": "Eriolepis echinata, commonly known as the spiny eriolepis, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique texture and appearance. Eriolepis echinata is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
