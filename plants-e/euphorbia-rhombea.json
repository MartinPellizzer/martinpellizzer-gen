    "intro": "Euphorbia rhombea, commonly known as the diamond plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive diamond-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves and stems allows it to survive in arid environments."
