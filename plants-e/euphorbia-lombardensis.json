    "intro": "Euphorbia lombardensis, commonly known as the Lombard spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Italy. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among many species in the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Euphorbia lombardensis is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
