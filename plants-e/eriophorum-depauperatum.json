    "intro": "Eriophorum depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, fluffy white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriophorum depauperatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is an indicator species for cold climates."
