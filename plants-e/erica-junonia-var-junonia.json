    "intro": "Erica junonia var. junonia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in winter, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds. Erica junonia var. junonia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
