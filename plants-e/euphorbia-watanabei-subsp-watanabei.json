    "intro": "Euphorbia watanabei subsp. watanabei, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
