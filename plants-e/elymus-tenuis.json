    "intro": "Elymus tenuis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
