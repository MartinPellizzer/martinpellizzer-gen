    "intro": "Erica tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled heath, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with four-sided stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Erica tetragona thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing thickets."
