It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum pichinchae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
