    "intro": "Euphorbia schimperiana var. trilobata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces unique, spiny cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
