It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum ocoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
