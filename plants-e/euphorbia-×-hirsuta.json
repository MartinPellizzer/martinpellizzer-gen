It is characterized by its distinctive woolly, gray-green foliage covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
