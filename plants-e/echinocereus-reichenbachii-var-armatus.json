    "intro": "Echinocereus reichenbachii var. armatus, commonly known as the heavily armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal maintenance."
