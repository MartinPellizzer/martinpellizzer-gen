It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped white flowers with a strong fragrance, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
