    "intro": "Euphorbia exstipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a distinctive floral structure known as a cyathium, which contains both male and female flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Euphorbia exstipulata is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
