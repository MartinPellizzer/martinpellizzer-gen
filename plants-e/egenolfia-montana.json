    "intro": "Egenolfia montana, commonly known as the mountain egenolfia, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Egenolfia montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
