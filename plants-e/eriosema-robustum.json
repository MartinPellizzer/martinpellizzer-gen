    "intro": "Eriosema robustum, commonly known as the rough eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a similar fuzzy texture. Eriosema robustum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats."
