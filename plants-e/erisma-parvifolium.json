    "intro": "Erisma parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved erisma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, adding a subtle floral display to its high-altitude environment. Erisma parvifolium is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in harsh mountain conditions."
