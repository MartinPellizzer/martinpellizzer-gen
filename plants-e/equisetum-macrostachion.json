    "intro": "Equisetum macrostachion, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically small and scale-like. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, a feature that distinguishes it from flowering plants. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum macrostachion is a hardy perennial that can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat."
