    "intro": "Eryngium ovinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant has a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Eryngium ovinum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
