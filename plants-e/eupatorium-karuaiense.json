It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are often fibrous and robust. Eupatorium karuaiense is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade conditions."
