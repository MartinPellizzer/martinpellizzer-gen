    "intro": "Ericoides unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided heath, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
