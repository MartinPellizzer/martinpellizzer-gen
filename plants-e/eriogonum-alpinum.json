    "intro": "Eriogonum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Eriogonum alpinum is well adapted to cold, arid environments and plays an important role in alpine ecosystems."
