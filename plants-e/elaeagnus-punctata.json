    "intro": "Elaeagnus punctata, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Elaeagnus punctata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
