    "intro": "Epipactis rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, showy inflorescence composed of greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are typically broad and elongated. It is pollinated by specific insects, and its reproductive cycle is closely tied to the local climate and seasonal patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
