    "intro": "Ephemerantha kelsallii, commonly known as the Kelsall's ephemeral, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom briefly during the spring season. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
