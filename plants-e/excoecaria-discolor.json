    "intro": "Excoecaria discolor, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains a single seed. Excoecaria discolor plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
