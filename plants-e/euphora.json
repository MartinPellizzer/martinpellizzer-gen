    "intro": "Euphora, commonly known as spurges, is a diverse genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually clusters of small flowers surrounded by modified leaves. Many species of Euphora produce a milky, toxic latex when their stems or leaves are broken. They are often found in a variety of habitats, including deserts, forests, and wetlands, and some species are used in traditional medicine. The genus includes both ornamental and invasive species, making them ecologically significant."
