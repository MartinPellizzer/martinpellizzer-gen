    "intro": "Euphorbia longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia longibracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
