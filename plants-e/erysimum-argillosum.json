    "intro": "Erysimum argillosum, commonly known as the clayrocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erysimum argillosum is often used in rock gardens and as a companion plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
