    "intro": "Enkianthus leveilleanus, commonly known as the pink-flowered enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy floral displays. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive. The leaves are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers."
