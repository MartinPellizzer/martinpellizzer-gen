    "intro": "Esterhazya petiolata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are short and sturdy. Esterhazya petiolata thrives in indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
