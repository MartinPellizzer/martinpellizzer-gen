    "intro": "Eria parishii, commonly known as the Hawaiian violet, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or white in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, clustered blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria parishii is considered a rare and endemic species."
