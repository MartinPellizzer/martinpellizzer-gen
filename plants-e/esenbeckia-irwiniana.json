    "intro": "Esenbeckia irwiniana, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on specific host trees for support. The plant is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often described as ethereal and ghost-like in appearance. Esenbeckia irwiniana is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a focus of conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
