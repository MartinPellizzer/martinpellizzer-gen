    "intro": "Eremaea asterocarpa subsp. histoclada, commonly known as the coastal eremaea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, often spiny growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops."
