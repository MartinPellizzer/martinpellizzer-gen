    "intro": "Euphorbia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
