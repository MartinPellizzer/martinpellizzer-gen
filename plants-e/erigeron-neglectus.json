    "intro": "Erigeron neglectus, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. Erigeron neglectus is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
