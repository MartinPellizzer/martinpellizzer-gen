    "intro": "Euonymus quadrigonus, commonly known as the four-angled euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its opposite, four-angled, elliptic leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, four-lobed fruits that are distinctive and ornamental. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its use in traditional medicine."
