    "intro": "Eremiris biglumis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Eremiris biglumis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
