    "intro": "Euphorbia decaryi var. decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
