    "intro": "Epidendrum euchroma, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat."
