    "intro": "Eichleria lucida, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow-green foliage that shimmers in sunlight. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are covered with a thick layer of rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. Eichleria lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural displays in controlled environments."
