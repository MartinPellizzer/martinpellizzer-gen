    "intro": "Epiphyllum opuntioides, commonly known as the orchid cactus, is a climbing cacti species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, flat, ribbed stems that resemble those of the prickly pear cactus. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming at night. Its stems are often used as a climbing structure, allowing it to grow on trees or rocks. Epiphyllum opuntioides is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
