    "intro": "Euphorbia similis, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, smooth stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia similis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
