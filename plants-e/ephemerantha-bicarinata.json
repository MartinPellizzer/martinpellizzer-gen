    "intro": "Ephemerantha bicarinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ephemerantha bicarinata is considered critically endangered."
