    "intro": "Echium fruticescens, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy blue to violet flowers, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Echium fruticescens is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
