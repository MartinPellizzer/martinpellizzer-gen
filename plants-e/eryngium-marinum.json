    "intro": "Eryngium marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in a tall, cylindrical spike, and it blooms from late summer to autumn. Eryngium marinum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
