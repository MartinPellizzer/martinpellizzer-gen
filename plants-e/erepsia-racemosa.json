    "intro": "Erepsia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
