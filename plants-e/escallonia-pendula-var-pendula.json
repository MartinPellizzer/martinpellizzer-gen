It is characterized by its pendulous branches that hang in graceful, weeping formations. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing dense foliage throughout the growing season. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
