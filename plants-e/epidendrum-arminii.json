    "intro": "Epidendrum arminii, commonly known as the Mexican flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum arminii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
