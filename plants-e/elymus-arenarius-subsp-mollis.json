    "intro": "Elymus arenarius subsp. mollis, commonly known as the silky sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and soft, silky foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often slightly drooping. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
