    "intro": "Euxenia mitiqui, commonly known as the Andean mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Euxenia mitiqui is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
