    "intro": "Echinocactus exsculptus var. foveolatus, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, rib-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal form foveolatus is distinguished by its deeply grooved ribs and a unique pattern of tubercles."
