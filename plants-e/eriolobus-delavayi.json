    "intro": "Eriolobus delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's eriolobus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
