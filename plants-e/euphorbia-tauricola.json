    "intro": "Euphorbia tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia tauricola is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
