    "intro": "Euphorbia foliiflua, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs."
