    "intro": "Euphorbia turczaninowii, commonly known as the Turk's cap euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Euphorbia turczaninowii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
