    "intro": "Euphorbia lycioides, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in dry landscapes."
