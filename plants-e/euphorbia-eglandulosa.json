    "intro": "Euphorbia eglandulosa, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its pale green, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which can be toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Euphorbia eglandulosa is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
