    "intro": "Euphorbia innocua, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spine-covered stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia innocua is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
