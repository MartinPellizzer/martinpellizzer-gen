It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and smooth, often greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically grey-green in color, with a rough, textured upper surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or cream in color, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
