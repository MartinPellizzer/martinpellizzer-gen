    "intro": "Elatostema didymocephalum, commonly known as the two-headed elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its two prominent flower heads, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
