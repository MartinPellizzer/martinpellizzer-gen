    "intro": "Eugenia bifaria, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, oval-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia bifaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
