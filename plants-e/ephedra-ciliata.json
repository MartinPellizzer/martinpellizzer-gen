    "intro": "Ephedra ciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many countries."
