    "intro": "Eberlea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Eberlea is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
