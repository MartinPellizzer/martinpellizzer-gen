    "intro": "Eriophorum \u00d7 pylaieanum, commonly known as the hybrid cottongrass, is a rare plant species resulting from the cross between Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum. It is characterized by its fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that appear in late summer, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriophorum \u00d7 pylaieanum is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
