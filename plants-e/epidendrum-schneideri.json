    "intro": "Epidendrum schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum schneideri is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
