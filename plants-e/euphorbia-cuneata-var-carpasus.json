    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata var. carpasus, commonly known as the redroot euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pinkish roots and its clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has spiny stems and leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it is often considered a challenging plant to handle and cultivate."
