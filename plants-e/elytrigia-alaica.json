    "intro": "Elytrigia alaica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Elytrigia alaica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
