    "intro": "Euterpe catinga var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden palm, is a variant of the Brazilian palm tree native to the northeastern region of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescences, which contrast beautifully with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its fruit, which is edible, contains a sweet, nutty pulp that is often consumed fresh or processed into beverages. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
