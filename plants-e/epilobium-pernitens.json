    "intro": "Epilobium pernitens, commonly known as the purple willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Epilobium pernitens is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
