    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The species produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, blooming early in the growing season. Its flowers are followed by woody capsules that release small, rounded seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee and heathland environments."
