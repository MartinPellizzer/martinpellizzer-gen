Its fronds are typically bipinnate, featuring multiple pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, layered pattern. The plant exhibits a robust rhizome system, which allows it to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories where high humidity is present. The leaves are often adorned with small, raised veins that contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
