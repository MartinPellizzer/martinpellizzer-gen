It features a distinctive, branched stem with a rough, waxy texture and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and leaves to survive dry conditions. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
