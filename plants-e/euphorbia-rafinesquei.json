    "intro": "Euphorbia rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, water-storing leaves and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
