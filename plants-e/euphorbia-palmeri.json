    "intro": "Euphorbia palmeri, commonly known as the palmer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia palmeri is also known for its milky latex, which can cause skin irritation."
