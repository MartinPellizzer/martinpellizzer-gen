    "intro": "Echinopsis poco, commonly known as the Little Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a low-growing cactus with a compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like moths and bats. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis poco is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
