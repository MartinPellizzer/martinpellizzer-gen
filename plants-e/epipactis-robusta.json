    "intro": "Epipactis robusta, commonly known as the robust helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. Epipactis robusta is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
