    "intro": "Elytrigia caespitosa subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form clumps. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
