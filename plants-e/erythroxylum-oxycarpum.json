    "intro": "Erythroxylum oxycarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries. Its botanical features make it distinct within the genus Erythroxylum, though it is not related to the coca plant."
