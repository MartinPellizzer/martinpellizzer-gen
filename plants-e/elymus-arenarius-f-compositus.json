    "intro": "Elymus arenarius f. compositus, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, particularly in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
