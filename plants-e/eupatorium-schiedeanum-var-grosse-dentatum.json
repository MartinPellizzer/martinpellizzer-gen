    "intro": "Eupatorium schiedeanum var. grosse-dentatum, commonly known as the broad-toothed boneset, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have prominent, broad teeth. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often aromatic and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
