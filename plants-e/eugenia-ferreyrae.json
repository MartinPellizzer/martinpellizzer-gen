It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that is typically red when mature. It is primarily found in humid, mountainous forests and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
