    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum var. subglabrum, commonly known as woolly willow or subglabrous willow, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered with short, soft hairs, though the variety subglabrum has a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds."
