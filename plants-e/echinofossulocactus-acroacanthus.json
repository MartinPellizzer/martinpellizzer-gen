    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus acroacanthus, commonly known as the spiny ribbed cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
