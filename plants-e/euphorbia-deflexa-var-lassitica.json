    "intro": "Euphorbia deflexa var. lassitica, commonly known as the Lassitica euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic common in many euphorbias for defense. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
