It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Encelia conspersa is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
