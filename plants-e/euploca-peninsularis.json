    "intro": "Euploca peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida starflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It is characterized by its star-shaped, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Euploca peninsularis is an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits."
