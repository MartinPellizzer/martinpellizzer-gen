    "intro": "Eriogonum howellii var. argense, commonly known as Howell's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant has a compact growth form. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
