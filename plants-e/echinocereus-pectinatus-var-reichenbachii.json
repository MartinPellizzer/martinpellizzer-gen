    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. reichenbachii, commonly known as the Reichenbach's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
