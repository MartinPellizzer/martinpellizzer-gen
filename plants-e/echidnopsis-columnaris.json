    "intro": "Echidnopsis columnaris, commonly known as the columnar echidnopsis, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Echidnopsis columnaris is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
