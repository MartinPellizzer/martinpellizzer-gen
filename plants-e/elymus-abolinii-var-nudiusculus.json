    "intro": "Elymus abolinii var. nudiusculus, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf sheaths, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Elymus species."
