    "intro": "Echinocarpus sigun, commonly known as the spiky burr plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its distinctive spiny fruits. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its fruit, known as an echinocarp, is covered in sharp, bristly spines that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a rough texture, and the plant can grow up to 2 meters in height. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
