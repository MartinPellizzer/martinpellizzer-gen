    "intro": "Elaphrium shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's elaphrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often with a subtle licorice-like scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphrium shaferi is considered a species of conservation concern."
