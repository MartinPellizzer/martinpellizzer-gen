It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces slender, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain environments."
