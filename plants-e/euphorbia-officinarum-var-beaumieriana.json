    "intro": "Euphorbia officinarum var. beaumieriana, commonly known as the Beaufort euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
