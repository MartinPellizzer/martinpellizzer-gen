    "intro": "Eucapnos, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Eucapnos species typically have narrow, linear leaves and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
