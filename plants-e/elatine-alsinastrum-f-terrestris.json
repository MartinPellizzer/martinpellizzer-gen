    "intro": "Elatine alsinastrum f. terrestris, commonly known as the prostrate waterwort, is a low-growing, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It features small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for life in wet environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and moist soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common indicator of waterlogged habitats."
