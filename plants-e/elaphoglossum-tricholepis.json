    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are usually protected by a thin, membranous covering. Elaphoglossum tricholepis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
