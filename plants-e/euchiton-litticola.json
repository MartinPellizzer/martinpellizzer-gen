    "intro": "Euchiton litticola, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Euchiton litticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
