    "intro": "Erepsia restiophila, commonly known as the red-stemmed ericoid, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive red-tinged stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a slightly aromatic scent, which contributes to its ecological role in supporting local insect populations. Erepsia restiophila thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude habitats."
