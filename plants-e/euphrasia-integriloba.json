    "intro": "Euphrasia integriloba, commonly known as the smooth-eyed toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Euphrasia integriloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
