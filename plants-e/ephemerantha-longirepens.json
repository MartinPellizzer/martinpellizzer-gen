    "intro": "Ephemerantha longirepens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, white, orchid-like flower with long, slender petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces a single, showy bloom that typically lasts only a few weeks. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
