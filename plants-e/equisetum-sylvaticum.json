    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, tooth-like spines. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-bearing cones at the top. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum sylvaticum is a primitive plant that has remained relatively unchanged since the Paleozoic era."
