    "intro": "Eria cepifolia, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Eria cepifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
