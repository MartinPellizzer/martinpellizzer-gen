    "intro": "Elytranthe adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' elytranthe, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its short stature and dense growth habit make it an effective ground cover in dry landscapes. Elytranthe adamsii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
