    "intro": "Epidendrum megalospathum, commonly known as the giant spathe epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in length, with a distinctive spathe and spadix structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Epidendrum megalospathum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
