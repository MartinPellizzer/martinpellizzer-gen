It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that have long petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests.
