    "intro": "Erigeron undulatus, commonly known as the wavering fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly wavy margin, which gives the species its common name. The flowers bloom in the summer months, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
