    "intro": "Ecbolium collinum, commonly known as the mountain ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Ecbolium collinum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in alpine habitats."
