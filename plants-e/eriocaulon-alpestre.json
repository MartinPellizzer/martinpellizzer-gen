    "intro": "Eriocaulon alpestre, commonly known as the alpine spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Eriocaulon alpestre thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
