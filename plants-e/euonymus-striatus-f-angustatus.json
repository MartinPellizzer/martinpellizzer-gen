    "intro": "Euonymus striatus f. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodbine, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter, adding ornamental value. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its foliage remains dense and dark green throughout the growing season, making it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
