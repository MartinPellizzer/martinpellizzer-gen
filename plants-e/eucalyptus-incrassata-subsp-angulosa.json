It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes more angular with age. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a grey-green upper surface and a white underside. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is often found in dry, open forests and is valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
