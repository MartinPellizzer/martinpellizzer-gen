    "intro": "Equisetum multiforme var. ramosum, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing cones at the tips. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
