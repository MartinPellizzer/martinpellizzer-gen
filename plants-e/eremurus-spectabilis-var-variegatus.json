    "intro": "Eremurus spectabilis var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated spear thistle, is a striking perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with large, showy, yellow-green bracts that resemble a crown of flames. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and often have a silvery-white variegation pattern, adding visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a dramatic addition to rock gardens or as a focal point in the landscape."
