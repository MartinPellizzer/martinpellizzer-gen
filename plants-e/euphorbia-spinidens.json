    "intro": "Euphorbia spinidens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia spinidens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
