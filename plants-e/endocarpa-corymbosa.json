    "intro": "Endocarpa corymbosa, commonly known as the red-fruited balsa, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that contain numerous seeds. The endocarp, or innermost layer of the fruit, is thick and leathery, providing protection to the seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
