    "intro": "Epicharis pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri's epicharis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often tubular in shape and attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which may serve as a defense mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epicharis pancheri is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
