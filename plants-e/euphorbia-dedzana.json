    "intro": "Euphorbia dedzana, commonly known as the Dedzana spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique cyathium, a cup-like structure that contains the flowers and is often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its tissues to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia dedzana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
