    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
