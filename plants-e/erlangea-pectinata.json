It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Erlangea pectinata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
