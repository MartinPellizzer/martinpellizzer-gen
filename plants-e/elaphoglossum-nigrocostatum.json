    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nigrocostatum, commonly known as the black-costed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant's spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is appreciated by fern enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
