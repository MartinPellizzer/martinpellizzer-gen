    "intro": "Erica sonora, commonly known as the Sonoran heath, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of pink or white flowers in spring. Erica sonora is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in low-water conditions."
