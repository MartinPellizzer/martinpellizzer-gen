    "intro": "Eleutherococcus giraldii var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy eleutherococcus, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
