    "intro": "Eugenia gaultherioides, commonly known as the common snowberry, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant has aromatic leaves and a woody structure, typical of many members of the Myrtaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Eugenia gaultherioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
