    "intro": "Evolvulus lagopus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pilosus.\" It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The hairy texture of its foliage helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores."
