It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
