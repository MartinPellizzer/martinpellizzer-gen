    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus f. caespitosus, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
