It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
