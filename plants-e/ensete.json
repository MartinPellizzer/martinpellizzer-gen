    "intro": "Ensete, commonly known as the false banana, is a large, herbaceous plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Musaceae family, which also includes true bananas and plantains. The plant can grow up to 10 meters tall, with broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense canopy. Ensete produces a stem that contains a starchy, edible pith used in traditional cuisine. Its unique growth habit and nutritional value make it an important crop in its native region."
