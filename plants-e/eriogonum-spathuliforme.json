    "intro": "Eriogonum spathuliforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces fluffy, seed-filled pods that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum spathuliforme is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
