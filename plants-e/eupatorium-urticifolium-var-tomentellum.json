    "intro": "Eupatorium urticifolium var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits."
