    "intro": "Euphorbia stormiae, commonly known as the Storm's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, branching stem covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
