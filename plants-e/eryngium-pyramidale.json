    "intro": "Eryngium pyramidale, commonly known as the spiked eryngo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a pyramid, surrounded by silver-white bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into prickly, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Eryngium pyramidale is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
