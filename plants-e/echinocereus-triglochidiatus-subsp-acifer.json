    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. acifer, commonly known as the Apache night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that often branches toward the top. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are typically white to yellow and are arranged in clusters, providing protection from herbivores. This species is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
