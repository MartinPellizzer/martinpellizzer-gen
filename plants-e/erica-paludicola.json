    "intro": "Erica paludicola, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet, acidic environments of western Europe. It thrives in peat bogs and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, white wax layer that helps reduce water loss. Erica paludicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
