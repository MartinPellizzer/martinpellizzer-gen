    "intro": "Eritrichium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf fleabane, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces delicate, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eritrichium pygmaeum is often found in meadows and mountain slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
