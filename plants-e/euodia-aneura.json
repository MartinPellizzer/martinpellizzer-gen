    "intro": "Euodia aneura, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Euodia aneura is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in coastal and sclerophyllous forest communities. It is also notable for its ability to tolerate saline and coastal conditions."
