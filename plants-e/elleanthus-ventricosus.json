    "intro": "Elleanthus ventricosus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, swollen stems that give it its scientific name. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Elleanthus ventricosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
