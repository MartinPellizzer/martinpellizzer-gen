    "intro": "Edritria paludosa, commonly known as the marsh thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Edritria paludosa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting pollinators."
