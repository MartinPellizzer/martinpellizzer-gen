    "intro": "Ericameria cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats. Ericameria cooperi is also valued for its ability to provide nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
