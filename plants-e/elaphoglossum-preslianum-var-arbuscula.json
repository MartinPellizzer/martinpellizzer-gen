    "intro": "Elaphoglossum preslianum var. arbuscula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin, and its spore-producing structures are typically found on the underside of the leaves. It is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or on cliff faces. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
