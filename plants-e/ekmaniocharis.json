It belongs to the genus Schlumbergera and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that bear bright, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, orange, and white. Ekmaniocharis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
