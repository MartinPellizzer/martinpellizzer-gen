It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Elymus afghanicus is valued for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
