    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. umbelliferum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
