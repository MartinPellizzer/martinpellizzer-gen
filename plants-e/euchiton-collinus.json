    "intro": "Euchiton collinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf echium, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Euchiton collinus is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in full sun."
