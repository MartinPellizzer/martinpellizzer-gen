    "intro": "Eurybia sibirica subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian Aster, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of Asia, including Siberia and parts of Eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and tundra. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer, producing blue to purple ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic beauty."
