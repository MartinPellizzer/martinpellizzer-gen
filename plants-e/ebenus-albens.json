    "intro": "Ebenus albens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Ebenus albens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
