    "intro": "Erica aspalathoides, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. Erica aspalathoides is also the source of the green tea known as Rooibos, which is native to the same region."
