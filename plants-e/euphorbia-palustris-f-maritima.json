    "intro": "Euphorbia palustris f. maritima, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a variant of the common spurge, characterized by its adaptation to coastal environments. It is a low-growing perennial plant with succulent, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in wet, saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
