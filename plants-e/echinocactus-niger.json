    "intro": "Echinocactus niger, commonly known as the black hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, spiny stems that are typically cylindrical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
