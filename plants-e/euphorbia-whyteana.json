    "intro": "Euphorbia whyteana, commonly known as the Whyte's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia whyteana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
