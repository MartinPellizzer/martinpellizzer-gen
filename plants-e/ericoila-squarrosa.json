    "intro": "Ericoila squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Cape Verde Islands. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
