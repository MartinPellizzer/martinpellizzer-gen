    "intro": "Eriostemon coxii, commonly known as the coastal eriostemon, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Eriostemon coxii is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
