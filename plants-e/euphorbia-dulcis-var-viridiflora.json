    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with a thick, fleshy appearance, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
