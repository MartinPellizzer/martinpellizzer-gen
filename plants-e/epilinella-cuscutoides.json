    "intro": "Epilinella cuscutoides, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and has a short growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
