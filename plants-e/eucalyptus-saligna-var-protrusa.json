    "intro": "Eucalyptus saligna var. protrusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a capacity for resprouting after fire. This variant is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
