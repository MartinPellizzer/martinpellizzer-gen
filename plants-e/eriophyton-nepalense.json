    "intro": "Eriophyton nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal silver grass, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, silver-hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
