It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with three distinct lobes, and it produces a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with a parachute structure. Enkylia trigyna is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
