    "intro": "Eucomis autumnalis subsp. amaryllidifolia, commonly known as the silver grass or autumn eucomis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and clusters of white to pale purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Hyacinthaceae family."
