    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. distortum, commonly known as the twisted horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its distinctive, twisted growth pattern. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is known for its whorled arrangement of branches and needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its stems are jointed and contain a high concentration of silica, giving them a rigid, grass-like appearance. The plant reproduces via spores and is an ancient species with a long evolutionary history."
