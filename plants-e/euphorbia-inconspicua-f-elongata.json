    "intro": "Euphorbia inconspicua f. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several feet in height, covered with small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
