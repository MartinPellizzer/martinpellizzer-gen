It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Eremanthe species are typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
