    "intro": "Erysimum insulare subsp. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, showing adaptations to arid and saline environments. Its leaves are broad and succulent, helping to store water, while its flowers are often bright yellow or white. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
