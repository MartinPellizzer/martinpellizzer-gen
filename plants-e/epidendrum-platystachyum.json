    "intro": "Epidendrum platystachyum, commonly known as the broad-stalked epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, linear leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platystachyum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
