    "intro": "Elemi, commonly known as *Canarium luzonicum*, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Philippines. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh, and is valued for its aromatic resins. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing its seeds. The resin, known as elemi, is harvested from the bark and has a sweet, balsamic scent. It is used in perfumery, traditional medicine, and as a natural incense."
