    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spatulatum, commonly known as the spoon-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that often exhibit a distinctive spoon-shaped base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Elaphoglossum spatulatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
