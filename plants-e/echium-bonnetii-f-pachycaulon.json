    "intro": "Echium bonnetii f. pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed blueweed, is a distinctive variant of the echium genus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its robust, thickened stems that store water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
