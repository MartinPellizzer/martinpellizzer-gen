    "intro": "Euphorbia arundelana, commonly known as the Arundel spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia arundelana is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
