    "intro": "Enchysia repens var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its adaptability to saline and sandy soils makes it a hardy species often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. The varietal name 'reflexa' refers to the downward-curving nature of its leaf margins, a distinctive morphological feature."
