    "intro": "Ephedra equisetiformis, commonly known as the creeping ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branching stems that resemble those of horsetails, hence its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures containing minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and often reduced to small, appressed structures. Ephedra equisetiformis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its stems and exhibiting drought tolerance."
