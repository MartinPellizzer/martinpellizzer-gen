    "intro": "Epilobium punctatum, commonly known as sticky willow or spotted willow, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, glandular surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with four petals and numerous stamens. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and thrives in moist, often disturbed soils. Epilobium punctatum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
