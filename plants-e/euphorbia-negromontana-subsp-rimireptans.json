    "intro": "Euphorbia negromontana subsp. rimireptans, commonly known as the black mountain spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, adaptations that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a branching structure that allows it to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized gardens."
