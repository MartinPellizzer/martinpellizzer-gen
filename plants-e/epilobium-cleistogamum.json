    "intro": "Epilobium cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous willowherb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated and do not open, while the open flowers are pollinated by insects. This plant typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features include slender stems, lanceolate leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink."
