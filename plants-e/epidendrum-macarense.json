    "intro": "Epidendrum macarense, commonly known as the Macaronesian Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, semi-woody growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in crevices, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum macarense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under suitable conditions."
