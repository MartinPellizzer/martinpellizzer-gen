    "intro": "Eulophus ambiguus, commonly known as the false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It produces small, smooth fruits that are dispersed by wind. Eulophus ambiguus is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles."
