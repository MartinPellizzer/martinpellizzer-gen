    "intro": "Echites parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is a herbaceous species that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Echites parviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
