    "intro": "Erigeron uniflorus subsp. frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic Fleabane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and invertebrates."
