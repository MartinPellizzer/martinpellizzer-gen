    "intro": "Elaeagnus gonyanthes, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant. Elaeagnus gonyanthes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil improvement."
