    "intro": "Eriogonum polyanthum, commonly known as the showy buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, and its stems are often branched. Eriogonum polyanthum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
