    "intro": "Encelia chaseae, commonly known as the Chase's encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert scrub and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Encelia chaseae is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
