    "intro": "Electranthera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its aquatic habitat. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
