    "intro": "Eleutherococcus henryi var. faberi, commonly known as Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported adaptogenic effects."
