    "intro": "Encephalartos cycadifolius, commonly known as the cycadifolius cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and often rare horticultural specimen."
