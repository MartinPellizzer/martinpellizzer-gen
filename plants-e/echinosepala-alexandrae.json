    "intro": "Echinosepala alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
