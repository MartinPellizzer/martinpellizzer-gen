    "intro": "Eupatorium oblongifolium var. apense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its robust root system and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
