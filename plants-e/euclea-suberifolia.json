    "intro": "Euclea suberifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved euclea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive rough texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
