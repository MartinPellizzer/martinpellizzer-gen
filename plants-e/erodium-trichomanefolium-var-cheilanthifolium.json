    "intro": "Erodium trichomanefolium var. cheilanthifolium, commonly known as the rock fern or coastal rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Portulacaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
