    "intro": "Euphorbia dioscoreoides subsp. dioscoreoides, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
