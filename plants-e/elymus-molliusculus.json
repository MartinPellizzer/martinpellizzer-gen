It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green hue when young, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects.
