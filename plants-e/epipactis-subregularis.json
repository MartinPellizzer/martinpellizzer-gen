    "intro": "Epipactis subregularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, hood-like lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in calcareous soils. It is a perennial species that produces a single flower per stem, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Epipactis subregularis is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
