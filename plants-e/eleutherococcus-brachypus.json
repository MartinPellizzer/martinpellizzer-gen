    "intro": "Eleutherococcus brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed deerberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
