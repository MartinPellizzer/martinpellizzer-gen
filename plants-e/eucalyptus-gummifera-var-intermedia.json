It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
