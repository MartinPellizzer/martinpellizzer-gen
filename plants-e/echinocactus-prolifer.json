    "intro": "Echinocactus prolifer, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, thick pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocactus prolifer is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
