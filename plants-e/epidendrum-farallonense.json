    "intro": "Epidendrum farallonense, commonly known as the Farallon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and inflorescence. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow or green lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its island habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
