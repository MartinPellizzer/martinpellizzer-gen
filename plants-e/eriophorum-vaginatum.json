    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and tundra. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Eriophorum vaginatum plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various small organisms."
