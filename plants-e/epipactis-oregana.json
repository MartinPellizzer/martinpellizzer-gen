    "intro": "Epipactis oregana, commonly known as the Oregon beak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal clump. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as coniferous forests and stream banks. Epipactis oregana is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific bees for reproduction."
