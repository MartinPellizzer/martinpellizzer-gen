    "intro": "Emorya rinconensis, commonly known as the Rinc\u00f3n emorya, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Emorya rinconensis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
