    "intro": "Erysimum incanum subsp. arrectisiliquum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wallflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and low maintenance requirements."
