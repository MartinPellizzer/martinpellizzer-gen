    "intro": "Eucalyptus paludosa, commonly known as the swamp gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and drooping branches, often growing in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a rough, felt-like texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
