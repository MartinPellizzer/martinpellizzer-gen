    "intro": "Erythrocoma aliena, commonly known as the red-cup orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking red, cup-shaped flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor mountain soils. Erythrocoma aliena is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
