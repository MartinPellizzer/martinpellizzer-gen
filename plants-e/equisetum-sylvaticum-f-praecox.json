    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. praecox, commonly known as the early common horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems often root at the nodes to form new plants. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
