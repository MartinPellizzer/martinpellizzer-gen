    "intro": "Euonymus multiflorus, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with smooth margins and a glossy texture. Euonymus multiflorus is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
