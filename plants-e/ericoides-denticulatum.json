    "intro": "Ericoides denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with finely serrated margins, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Ericoides denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
