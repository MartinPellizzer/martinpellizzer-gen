    "intro": "Encelia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Encelia glandulosa is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
