    "intro": "Euphorbia peplifolia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a woody stem with a distinctive, branched structure and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a characteristic common among many euphorbias. Its leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia peplifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
