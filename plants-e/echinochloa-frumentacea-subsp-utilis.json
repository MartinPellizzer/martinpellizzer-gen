    "intro": "Echinochloa frumentacea subsp. utilis, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as fields and roadsides, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a challenging species to control in cultivated crops."
