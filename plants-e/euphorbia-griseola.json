    "intro": "Euphorbia griseola, commonly known as the gray spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
