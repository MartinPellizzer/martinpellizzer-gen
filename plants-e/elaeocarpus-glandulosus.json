    "intro": "Elaeocarpus glandulosus, commonly known as the woolly elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with short, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that turn red when mature. Its fruits are edible and contain a single seed, making it an important species in certain local ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
