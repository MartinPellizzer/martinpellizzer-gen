    "intro": "Ericoides traguliferum, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in late spring and are an important food source for pollinators. The plant's dense growth habit provides habitat and protection for various alpine species."
