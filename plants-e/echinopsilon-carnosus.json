    "intro": "Echinopsilon carnosus, commonly known as the hairy echinops, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its scientific name reflects its spiny or echinoid appearance, though the plant itself is not particularly spiny. Echinopsilon carnosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
