    "intro": "Eucalyptus umbellata var. glaucina, commonly known as the silver-leafed gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-white bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, contributing to its silvery appearance. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in woodland and open forest habitats."
