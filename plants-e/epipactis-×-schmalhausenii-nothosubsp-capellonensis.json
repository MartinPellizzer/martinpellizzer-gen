    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schmalhausenii nothosubsp. capellonensis, commonly known as the Capellone hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis papaveracea. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow to brownish-green flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and can reach up to 15 cm in length. This nothosubspecies is notable for its morphological variability and is considered a rare and localized occurrence in parts of Europe."
