It features spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by white, bristly rays. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
