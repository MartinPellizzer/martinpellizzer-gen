    "intro": "Ephedra lomatolepis, commonly known as the desert ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red berries, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Ephedra lomatolepis is part of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties. Its ability to thrive in harsh, desert conditions makes it an important component of its ecosystem."
