    "intro": "Eragrostis sylviae, commonly known as the woodland panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found in temperate climates. Eragrostis sylviae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
