It is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruit, which is composed of 8\u201310 oil-rich seeds enclosed in a dark brown, woody capsule. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its essential oils and medicinal properties. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is harvested when fully mature, typically in late autumn, and is used in both culinary and traditional medicine applications."
