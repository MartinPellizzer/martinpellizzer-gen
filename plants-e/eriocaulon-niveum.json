    "intro": "Eriocaulon niveum, commonly known as the snowflake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species for wetland conservation and biodiversity."
