    "intro": "Emmotum orbiculatum, commonly known as the globe-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Emmotum orbiculatum thrives in rocky or soil-covered areas, often in temperate regions. Its ability to retain moisture makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
