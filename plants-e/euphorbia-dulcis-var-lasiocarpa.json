    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
