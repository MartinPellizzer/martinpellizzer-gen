    "intro": "Elymus cognatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus cognatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its ability to grow in poor soils makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
