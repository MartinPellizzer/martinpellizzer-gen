    "intro": "Erica gnaphaloides, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Erica gnaphaloides is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
