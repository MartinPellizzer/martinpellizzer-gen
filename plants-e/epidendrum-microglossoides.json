    "intro": "Epidendrum microglossoides, commonly known as the miniature tongue orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
