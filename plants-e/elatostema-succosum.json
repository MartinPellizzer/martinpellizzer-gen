It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Elatostema succosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
