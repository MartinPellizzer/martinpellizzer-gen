    "intro": "Elaeagnus formosana, commonly known as the Formosan silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Elaeagnus formosana is also valued for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
