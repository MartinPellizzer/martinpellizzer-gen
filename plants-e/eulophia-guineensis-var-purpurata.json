    "intro": "Eulophia guineensis var. purpurata, commonly known as the Purple-tinged Eulophia, is a striking orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive violet or purple hue, and are arranged in a dense inflorescence. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
