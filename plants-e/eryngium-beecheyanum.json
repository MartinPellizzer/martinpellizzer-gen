    "intro": "Eryngium beecheyanum, commonly known as the beach eryngium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a sea urchin, which are composed of small, tubular flowers surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eryngium beecheyanum is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
