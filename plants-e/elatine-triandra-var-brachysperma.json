    "intro": "Elatine triandra var. brachysperma, commonly known as the narrow-sperma water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its short, slender stems and rapid growth make it a common sight in ponds and wetlands. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is often overlooked but plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
