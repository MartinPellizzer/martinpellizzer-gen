    "intro": "Espeletia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, featuring dense, woolly leaves that help retain moisture and protect against strong winds. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the dry season, attracting various pollinators. Espeletia occidentalis is also known for its ability to form clumps or small shrubs, contributing to the unique vegetation structure of its habitat."
