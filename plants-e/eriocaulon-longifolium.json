    "intro": "Eriocaulon longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually arranged in spikelets, and are adapted for wind pollination. Eriocaulon longifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
