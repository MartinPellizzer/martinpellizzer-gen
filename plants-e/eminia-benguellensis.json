    "intro": "Eminia benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eminia benguellensis is valued for its resilience and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
