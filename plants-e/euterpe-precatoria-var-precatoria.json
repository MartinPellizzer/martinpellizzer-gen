It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that are often marked with distinctive red veins on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, edible fruits. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in tropical gardens. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential use in traditional medicine."
