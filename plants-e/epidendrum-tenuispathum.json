    "intro": "Epidendrum tenuispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and relatively small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. It has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows laterally from pseudobulbs, and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
