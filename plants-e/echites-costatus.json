    "intro": "Echites costatus, commonly known as the coastal echites, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along the shoreline. Echites costatus is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
